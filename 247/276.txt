Introduction 


Both headache and sleep disorders are common problems 
in children [1,2]. Although it is common thinking 

that headache and sleep problems are related, there has 
been little research in this area. A few studies examined 
this relationship in children and found a high frequency 
of sleep disturbances involving sleep quality, night 
awakening, nocturnal symptoms, and daytime sleepiness 
in children with headache [3,4]. However, those 
studies were performed in children from pediatric 
neurology and headache clinics so they represented a 
select group. To our knowledge, this is the first population-
based study which examines this particular relationship 
in children. 

The aim of the present study was (1) to determine 
headache (migraine and nonmigraine headache) prevalence 
among school-aged children, and (2) to determine 
the association between headache and sleep disturbances 
among these children. 

Study 
Design 


This study was part of the Sleep Disordered Breathing 
in School Children Project [5], and it was approved by 
the Regional Director of Education, which serves as the 
Institute of Human Subject Protection Committee for the 
schools in Istanbul. Multistage, randomized sampling was 
used for data collection. The city of Istanbul has a 
population of approximately 12 million people and there 
are 32 school districts. Nine districts out of 32 were 
selected randomly. All schools were listed and among 
them, 72 were selected by systematic sampling. Classes 
were also randomly chosen from every school. The questionnaire 
and a personally addressed letter asking for 
consent were mailed to the parents. Data collection was 
performed between March and May 2002. Among the 
2746 students, 2228 returned fully completed questionnaires 
(81.1%).

The 
Questionnaire 


The questions about the demographic data included the 
name, date of birth, sex, home address, home phone 
number, school name, and class name of the student. The 
55-item questionnaire consisted of two parts: questions 
related to headache and sleep disorders. The questions 
about headache consisted of time of onset; frequency 
(every day, more than once a week, once a week, once a 
month, other); duration—minutes (less than 1 hour), hours 
(1 hour or more), and days; severity (mild, moderate, 
severe); limitation in daily activities; aggravating factors 
(exercise, stress, tiredness); unilateral headache; associated 
symptoms (nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia); 
medication history; and family history. Headache 
was classified according to the International 
Headache Society (IHS) 2004 criteria [6]. Headache lasting 
hours (1 hour or more) was considered as migraine. 
We did not specify headache lasting between 1-2 hours 
and headache lasting more than 2 hours each, as we 
thought getting headache duration details, more than 1 
hour long, would be difficult to obtain through a questionnaire. 
At least two or more of the following criteria 
had to be present for migraine diagnosis: unilateral 
location, pulsating quality, moderate to severe in intensity, 
and aggravation by physical activity. In addition, 
during the headache either (1) nausea and/or vomiting, 
or (2) photophobia and phonophobia had to be present. 
Headache was categorized as moderate to severe if the 
headache was limiting daily activities or if parents or 
child rated headache as moderate or severe. The presence 
of aura was not questioned in this study, and 
therefore a distinction between migraine with or without 
aura was not made. Headaches not fulfilling these 
criteria were considered nonmigraine type headache but 
not specified further. 

Questions related to sleep disorders included parasomnias 
(bedtime struggle, teeth grinding, sleep vocalizations,

sleepwalking, nightmares), sweating during sleep, excessive 
daytime sleepiness, and snoring. Parents reported 
snoring on a four-point scale: 0 (never), 1 (occasionally), 
2 (often), and 3 (always). Habitual snoring was considered 
present if parents reported snoring as either often or 
always. Excessive daytime sleepiness was considered to 
be present if at least one of the following criteria was met: 
1—falling asleep during class; 2—falling asleep at theater/ 
concert/visiting friends/relatives; 3—falling asleep during 
a conversation. The frequency of each parasomnia and 
sweating during sleep was evaluated separately (i—every 
2-3 months; ii—1-3 times a month; iii—more than 3 times

Statistical 
Analysis 


Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS for

chi-square for trend analysis were used for the comparison 
of categorical variables. The strength of association was 
described by odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals.

Results 


Seventy-two schools from nine school districts were 
surveyed. Of the 2746 children participating in the study, 
2395 (87.2%) returned the questionnaire and among them 
2228 (81.1%) were fully completed. Females and males 
were almost equally represented in the study (49.1% and 
50.9%, respectively). The age of the students ranged from 
6 to 13 years with a mean and a standard deviation of 8.4 

. 
1.4 years. 
Headache 


The prevalence of headache was 31.4% (95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 29.5-33.4%). Among the 2228 participants, 
74 (3.3%) fulfilled the migraine criteria, whereas 
626 (28.1%) had nonmigraine headache. The rate of 
headache was 33.3% among females and 29.6% among 
males; the difference was not statistically significant. The 
rate of headache increased with age for both sexes. Among 
females the rates for 7 and 10 years of age were 27.0% 
and 40.6%, respectively (P 
. 
0.001, chi square for trend). 
For males the corresponding rates were 23.8% and 34%, 
respectively (P 
. 
0.017, chi-square for trend). 

The prevalence of migraine was similar for both sexes, 
3.0% for the females and 3.6% for the males. There was a 
slight increase in the rate of migraine with age; among 
females the rate was 2.2% for 7-year-olds and 3.8% for 
10-year-olds, among males it was 2.4% for 7-year-olds 
and 4.5% for 10-year-olds. Yet the difference was not 
statistically significant. Headache type according to age 
groups by sex is presented in Figures 1 and 2. 

The rate of family history of headache among migraine 
and nonmigraine headache groups were 87.3% and 65.6%, 
respectively (P 
. 
0.001). 77.5% of students experiencing 
migraine and 63.8% with nonmigraine headache were 
using pain relief medications (P 
. 
0.02). Table 1 summarizes 
the characteristics of headache among migraine and 
nonmigraine groups. 

Association 
of 
Headache 
With 
Sleep 
Disorders 


The rates of all sleep disturbances were significantly 
higher among the migraine group, with a trend towards 
a lower frequency among nonmigraine and nonheadache 
groups. Table 2 presents the odds ratios of headache 
types for the presence of several sleep characteristics 
while controlling for age and sex. The odds ratio 
of habitual snoring for the nonmigraine headache group 
was 1.39, whereas it was 1.97 for the migraine group. 
The odds ratios of daytime sleepiness for the nonmigraine 
and migraine group were 1.78 and 2.17, respectively. 
When snoring was controlled, odds ratios of 
daytime sleepiness for nonmigraine and migraine headaches 
were 1.68 (95% CI: 1.33-2.12) and 2.00 (95% CI: 
1.19-3.38), respectively. 

As medications can have adverse consequences on 
sleep, headache patients taking any medications were 
compared with headache patients taking no medications. 
There was no statistically significant difference in the 
frequency of sleep disturbances among headache sufferers 
who used medications vs those who did not use any 
medications (P 
. 
0.05).

Discussion 


There are a few reports which reveal an association 
between headache and sleep disorders in children; however, 
these studies were performed on a limited number of 
children within selected populations [3,4,7]. This report is 
the first population-based study among children that examines 
this relationship. 

The association between headache and sleep disorders 
can have different aspects. One may cause the other, or 
they may share a common intrinsic etiology. Both headache 
and sleep disorders have been thought to be caused 
by neurotransmitter changes or circadian rhythm disorders 
[8]. Serotonin secreted from dorsal raphe nucleus is 
associated with migraine and sleep cycle [9,10].Ithas 
been demonstrated that the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the 
hypothalamus regulates the release of serotonin from 
dorsal raphe. Serotonin decreases rapid eye movement 
sleep, and its decline in systemic circulation has been 
associated with migraine [11]. 

Headache 


The prevalence of migraine ranges from 3.0% to 10.6% 
according to different studies [12-18]. Migraine prevalence 
was 3.3% in the present study, which is comparable 
but lower than most of the previous studies. It should 
be noted that the diagnostic criteria used as well as the age 
group studied might result in different rates for headache 
types. Two recent studies reported the prevalence of 
pediatric migraine in the Middle East. The first one 
performed in Iran, which evaluated a random sample of 
1868 teenaged females (aged 11-18 years) reported an 
overall prevalence rate of 6.1% for migraine [17]. The 
second study evaluated 1400 randomly selected Saudi 
children in grades 1 through 9. Overall headache prevalence 
was 49.8%, and the prevalence of migraine was 
7.1% [18]. A meta-analysis of prevalence studies suggests 
that migraine is most common in North and South America, 
followed by Europe, and lowest in Africa and Asia 
[19]. A recent population-based study performed in 

schoolchildren in Turkey aged 8-16 years revealed a 
current headache prevalence of 31.3%, which was similar 
to our findings. Yet in the mentioned study, the reported 
migraine prevalence was 10.4% [20]. The reason for the 
differences between the prevalence rates of migraine could 
be explained by the criteria used for the diagnosis of 
migraine. The previous study used the revised IHS criteria 
for the diagnosis which had an increased sensitivity for the 
diagnostic rate of migraine [21]. The variations between 
the two studies could also have resulted from the age 
difference in the survey (younger in our study) as well as 
the difference between the two geographic locations. 
Istanbul is located in northwestern Turkey and Mersin is in 
southern Turkey. 

Migraine prevalence increases with age. The present 
study determined an increasing trend in the headache 
prevalence as children got older. There was a statistically 
significant difference between the 7-year-olds and 10year-
olds among both sexes, but this difference did not 
reach statistical significance for migraine. According to 
Stewart et al. [22], the incidence of migraine without aura 
in females peaked between the ages of 14 and 17 years. In 
schoolchildren, the prevalence of migraine increases with 
age, with male preponderance in children aged less than 12 
years and female preponderance thereafter [19].Inthe 
present study, migraine prevalence was slightly higher in 
males compared with females. However, the age range 
was between 6 and 13 and only partially included the 
adolescence period. So we may not have observed the 
usual peak of migraine observed in adolescent females. 

The rate of family history of headache was 87.3% in this 
study, which is consistent with previous studies disclosing 
a similar headache frequency among family members 
[23,24]. 

Association 
of 
Headache 
With 
Sleep 
Disorders 


All of the sleep problems we studied among school-
aged children were more frequent among migraine sufferers 
compared with nonmigraine and no headache groups. 

Isik et al: Headache and Sleep Disorders 149 


There was a trend between the three groups; the prevalence 
of all the sleep disorders was the highest among the 
migraine group. 

The first sleep disorder studied was snoring. The odds 
ratio of habitual snoring for the nonmigraine headache 
group was 1.39, whereas it was 1.97 for the migraine 
group. According to Miller et al. [3] the rate of snoring 
among children with migraine is 23%. Torok et al. [25] 
studied snoring in 11-to 15-year-old schoolchildren and 
found that headache was more common in children who 
snored frequently. Bruni et al. [4] found a 2.9% rate of 
snoring in children with migraine headache. There is a 
well-known association between cluster headaches and 
obstructive sleep apnea as well [26,27]. Hypoxemia during 
rapid eye movement sleep is thought to result in cluster 
headache. Snoring can be responsible for an increased rate 
of headache with a similar mechanism. 

Migraine headaches were also associated with parasomnias. 
Bedtime struggle, teeth grinding, sleep vocalizations, 
nightmares, and sleep walking rates were highest among 
the migraine group, followed by the nonmigraine and no 
headache groups (Table 2). Our results are concordant 
with previous studies which revealed a high correlation 
between parasomnias and migraines. Bruni et al. [4] found 
that the rate of night sweating, sleep talking, bruxism, and 
nightmares was higher among migraine patients compared 
with tension headaches and control groups. However, 
sleepwalking, bedwetting, and sleep terrors were not 
higher in the migraine group. Barabas et al. [28] found a 
high frequency of somnambulism in children suffering 
from migraine. In the present study, sleepwalking had a 
borderline statistical significance, although all other 
parasomnias were highly associated with migraine 
headaches. The frequency of parasomnias in the general 
population is lower compared with children with neurologic 
problems [29]. 

Headache was also associated with excessive daytime 
sleepiness. Increased sleepiness was determined to be 
associated with headaches in previous studies performed 
in children [3,4,7]. Although it is difficult to evaluate 
whether it is the cause or the result of headache, it is more 
likely to be the consequence of sleep disorders. Excessive 
sleepiness can be found in children with sleep-disordered 
breathing [30]. In the present study, when snoring was 
controlled, headache type still continued to increase daytime 
sleepiness. 

Limitations 


One of the drawbacks of this study is that it is based on 
parental reports. Because the data were collected via 
questionnaires, history taking and physical examination 
are lacking. However, parental information has proved to 
be an effective method for diagnosing sleep disorders [31]. 
Sasmaz et al. [32] reported that 74% of parents are aware 
of their children’s headache, and migraine type of headache 
is one of the factors that affect the awareness level of 

150 PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY Vol. 36 No. 3 

parents. It is also known that physical and neurologic 
examinations rarely affect migraine diagnoses in the general 
population [33]. This study is the first population-
based study which examines the particular association 
between headache and sleep problems in a large sample. 

Another possible limitation is the question of headache 
duration. The headache duration was not specified more 
than hours in the questionnaire, so headaches lasting 
between 1-2 hours were considered as migraine, theoretically. 
IHS criteria suggest that migraine can last 1 hour in 
children, although headache lasting less than 2 hours 
requires prospective diary studies [6]. 

Although an association between headache and sleep 
disorders was demonstrated in this cross-sectional study, a 
causal relationship cannot be determined without a follow-up 
study looking at the treatment effect. 

Bruni et al. [34] demonstrated a reduction in the 
frequency and duration of migraine in the group of 
children who received sleep hygiene education compared 
with those who received no education. The findings 
reported herein also suggest that physicians taking care of 
children with headache should ask questions about sleep 
behaviors as part of the standard headache assessment. 
Such evaluations are important because children may not 
raise concerns about sleep-related problems.
