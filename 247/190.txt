Abstract 


Sighs 
(SIs) 
and 
gross 
body 
movements 
(GMs) 
during 
sleep 
are 
common 
spontaneous, 
arousal 
behaviors 
during 
sleep. 
These 
physiological 
behaviors 
either 
precede 
or 
follow 
central 
respiratory 
pauses 
(CPs) 
during 
sleep 
in 
normal 
subjects. 
However, 
little 
attention 
has 
been 
paid 
to 
the 
temporal 
relationships 
between 
CPs 
and 
spontaneous 
behaviors 
except 
in 
early 
infancy. 
In 
the 
present 
study, 
the 
age-and 
state-related 
changes 
in 
the 
frequency 
and 
duration 
of 
apnea 
–behavior 
relationships 
were 
studied 
cross-sectionally 
in 
19 
healthy 
children 
aged 
between 
3 
months 
and 
7 
years 
of 
age. 
CPs, 
SIs, 
and 
GMs 
were 
assessed 
in 
a 
single 
all-night 
polysomnography 
and 
respiratory 
inductive 
plethysmography. 
We 
divided 
the 
data 
into 
two 
age 
groups: 
less 
and 
more 
than 
15 
months 
of 
age. 
The 
results 
showed 
that 
frequency 
of 
CPs 
z 
10 
s 
increased 
with 
age, 
while 
the 
frequency 
of 
GMs 
and 
SIs 
decreased. 
Isolated 
CPs 
appeared 
more 
frequently 
during 
rapid-eyemovement 
sleep 
(REMS) 
than 
during 
nonrapid-eye-movement 
sleep 
(NREMS). 
The 
frequency 
of 
both 
SIs 
and 
GMs 
that 
appeared 
after 
CPs 
was 
higher 
during 
REMS 
than 
during 
NREMS. 
The 
sum 
of 
CPs 
preceded 
by 
SI, 
and 
CPs 
preceded 
by 
GM 
accounted 
for 
about 
75% 
of 
all 
central 
apnea 
events. 
These 
two 
events 
appeared 
more 
frequently 
during 
NREMS 
than 
during 
REMS 
and 
the 
duration 
of 
both 
events 
in 
NREMS 
increased 
significantly 
with 
age. 
During 
NREMS, 
few 
and 
delayed 
behaviors 
thought 
to 
restart 
respiration 
after 
CPs 
have 
been 
described. 
Future 
work 
should 
examine 
developmental 
differences 
in 
the 
occurrence 
of 
physiological 
behaviors 
in 
relation 
to 
CP 
in 
NREMS 
and 
REMS.

Introduction 
Sleep 
apneas 
are 
generally 
divided 
into 
three 
types: 
obstructive, 
central, 
and 
mixed 
apneas. 
In 
normal 
children, 
most 
of 
sleep 
apneas 
are 
central 
ones 
which 
are 
not 
associated 
with 
transcutaneous 
oxygen 
saturation 
(SpO2) 
< 
90% 
[1,2]. 


During 
sleep 
of 
healthy 
children, 
sighs 
(SIs) 
[3,4] 
as 
well 
as 
body 
movements, 
including 
gross 
body 
movements 
(GMs) 
[5–7], 
occur 
frequently. 
Some 
authors 
interpret 
SIs 
[8–10] 
and 
GMs 
[8–12] 
as 
arousal 
events 
during 
sleep 
and 
the 
relationship 
of 
apnea 
to 
arousal 
promotion 
is 
important 
in 
terms 
of 
Sudden 
Infant 
Death 
Syndrome 
in 
infancy 
and 
sleep 
disturbances 
in 
older 
children. 
However,

mechanisms 
of 
SIs 
and 
GMs 
remain 
unknown, 
a 
few 
studies 
have 
focused 
on 
these 
events 
during 
sleep. 


Both 
SIs 
[1,3,10,13–18] 
and 
GMs 
[2,16,17,19] 
either 
precede 
or 
follow 
central 
respiratory 
pauses 
(CPs) 
during 
sleep. 
These 
relationships 
have 
been 
reported 
in 
neonates 
[14,17,19] 
and 
infants 
[10,13–15,17,19]. 
Although 
CP 
preceded 
by 
GM 
or 
SI 
has 
been 
considered 
to 
be 
less 
serious 
and 
has 
been 
discounted 
as 
not 
pathological 
apneas 
especially 
beyond 
infancy 
[1,2], 
no 
systematic 
study 
has 
been 
made 
on 
these 
relationships 
in 
children. 
We 
hypothesize 
that 
studying 
the 
links 
between 
these 
behavioral 
events 
and 
apneas 
will 
help 
to 
elucidate 
some 
mechanisms 
and 
characteristics 
of 
central 
apnea. 


Although 
SIs 
and 
GMs 
often 
appear 
together 
[8–10], 
artifacts 
on 
the 
polygraphic 
recordings 
make 
it 
difficult 
to 
recognize 
SIs 
that 
appear 
during 
GMs. 
Thus, 
it 
is 
not 
known 
what 
the 
temporal 
relationship 
is 
between 
CP 
and 
the 
arousal 
events 
of 
SIs 
and 
GMs. 
In 
the 
following 
study, 
we 
examined 
the 
following 
four 
types 
of 
combination 
among

2. 
Methods 
2.1. 
Participants 
Nineteen 
neurologically 
and 
developmentally 
normal 
children 
(13 
males, 
6 
females) 
aged 
from 
3 
months 
to 
7 
years 
(mean 
age, 
28 
months 
8 
days; 
standard 
deviation, 
25 
months 
21 
days) 
were 
the 
participants 
of 
this 
study. 
Based 
on 
prior 
screening, 
the 
participants 
were 
free 
of 
a 
history 
of 
airway 
obstruction 
that 
would 
lead 
to 
falls 
in 
levels 
of 
SpO2 
of 
less 
than 
90% 
during 
sleep 
[1,22]. 
No 
children 
had 
chronic 
illness 
and 
no 
drug 
was 
administered 
for 
at 
least 
1 
week 
before 
each 
recording. 
Informed 
consent 
was 
obtained 
from 
all 
parents 
after 
the 
procedure 
and 
aims 
of 
this 
study 
were 
fully 
explained. 


2.2. 
Polysomnographical 
examination 
All 
recordings 
were 
performed 
in 
an 
isolated 
semisoundproof 
recording 
room 
with 
an 
air 
conditioner 
(temperature 
range, 
22–24 
jC). 
The 
recording 
period 
began 
at 
the 
onset 
of 
natural 
sleep 
until 
natural 
awakening 
the 
next 
morning. 
Polysomnography 
included 
electroencephalography 
(EEG), 
electrooculography, 
electromyography 
of 
the 
chin 
and 
trunk 
muscles, 
SpO2 
monitoring 
(Ohmeda 
Biox 
3740), 
respiratory 
monitoring 
with 
a 
microprocessor-based 
respiratory-inductive 
plethysmography 
[23] 
(RIP: 
Respisomnograph; 
NIMS), 
and 
video 
monitoring. 
The 
recording 
paper 
speed 
was 
set 
at 


1.5 
cm/s 
A 
parent 
slept 
with 
his/her 
child 
in 
a 
queen-sized 
bed 
at 
all 
ages. 
2.3. 
Definition 
of 
sleep 
components 
Sleep 
stages 
were 
determined 
according 
to 
standard 
criteria 
[24]. 
We 
calculated 
the 
percentages 
of 
rapid-eyemovement 
sleep 
(REMS) 
and 
nonrapid-eye-movement 
sleep 
(NREMS) 
as 
a 
proportion 
of 
total 
sleep 
time 
(TST). 
Recent 
experience 
using 
RIP 
without 
concomitant 
airflow 
assessment 
by 
thermistors 
showed 
that 
nearly 
half 
of 
obstructive 
apneas 
are 
missed 
by 
RIP 
recording 
alone 
in 
infants 
[25].To 
avoid 
missing 
obstructive 
sleep 
apneas, 
we 
carefully 
examined 
polygrams, 
and 
ascertained 
that 
observable 
paradoxical 
inward 
rib 
cage 
movements 
did 
not 
occur 
in 
our 
participants 
except 
for 
those 
associated 
with 
movements. 


A 
CP 
was 
scored 
when 
there 
was 
complete 
cessation 
of 
all 
respiratory 
effort, 
resulting 
in 
flat 
signals 
in 
the 
rib, 
abdomen 
and 
their 
summation 
signals 
for 
at 
least 
10 
s 
[1] 
on 
the 
RIP. 
We 
defined 
a 
GM 
as 
any 
movement 
including 


trunk 
muscle 
activity 
(hemilaretal 
rectus 
abdominis) 
which 
lasted 
2 
s 
or 
more 
[5–7]. 
A 
SI 
was 
defined 
as 
a 
deep 
and 
long 
respiration 
that 
had 
respiratory 
signal 
amplitude 
at 
least 
two 
times 
higher 
than 
both 
the 
previous 
and 
the 
following 
stable 
respiratory 
signal 
amplitudes 
on 
the 
microprocessor-
based 
RIP. 
Although 
the 
occurrence 
of 
SI 
was 
judged 
on 
the 
RIP, 
electromyography 
artifacts 
associated 
with 
body 
movements 
make 
it 
difficult 
to 
recognize 
SIs 
that 
appear 
during 
GMs. 
We 
were 
obliged 
to 
score 
these 
episodes 
as 
GMs. 


We 
examined 
SI 
that 
appeared 
after 
CP 
(CPsi), 
GM 
that 
appeared 
after 
CP 
(CPgm), 
CP 
preceded 
by 
SI 
(SIcp), 
CP 
preceded 
by 
GM 
(GMcp), 
isolated 
CP, 
isolated 
SI, 
and 
isolated 
GM, 
respectively. 


2.4. 
Age 
Normative 
data 
for 
apneas 
in 
children 
beyond 
the 
first 
year 
of 
life 
have 
been 
reported 
[1,18] 
and 
the 
frequency 
of 
respiratory 
pauses 
remains 
constant 
from 
ages 
1 
or 
2 
to 
15 
or 
16 
years 
[18,26]. 
Hence, 
we 
divided 
the 
data 
into 
two 
age 
groups: 
(1) 
infants 
less 
than 
15 
months 
of 
age 
(n 
= 
9: 
mean 
age, 
8 
months 
21 
days; 
standard 
deviation, 
3 
months 
21 
days), 
and 
(2) 
infants 
and 
children 
more 
than 
15 
months 
of 
age 
(n 
= 
10: 
mean 
age, 
45 
months 
27 
days; 
standard 
deviation, 
24 
months 
0 
days). 
These 
data 
take 
into 
account 
the 
balance 
of 
age 
distribution 
and 
numbers 
of 
the 
participants. 


The 
rate 
(frequency 
per 
hour), 
proportion 
(CP 
type/Total 
CPs), 
and 
duration 
of 
each 
of 
these 
seven 
parameters 
in 
addition 
to 
sleep 
state 
(REMS, 
NREMS) 
and 
TST 
were 
measured 
for 
the 
two 
age 
groups. 


2.5. 
Statistical 
analysis 
The 
rate 
(frequency/h) 
of 
each 
parameter 
during 
each 
sleep 
stage 
was 
compared 
between 
the 
two 
age 
groups 
using 
the 
Student’s 
t 
test. 
The 
average 
duration 
of 
each 
parameter 
was 
compared 
in 
both 
REMS 
and 
NREMS, 
and 
between 
two 
age 
groups 
using 
the 
Student’s 
t 
test. 
When 
necessary, 
the 
t 
test 
was 
modified 
for 
unequal 
variances. 
Analysis 
of 
the 
difference 
in 
the 
proportion 
of 
each 
CP 
type 
across 
groups 
was 
compared 
using 
the 
chi-square 
test. 
Fisher’s 
Exact 
Test 
was 
used 
in 
comparisons 
where 
the 
expected 
frequency 
was 
less 
than 
5. 
In 
each 
age 
group, 
a 
correlation 
coefficient 
between 
the 
event 
type 
(e.g., 
CPsi, 
SIcp, 
etc.) 
and 
age 
in 
months 
was 
calculated 
using 
Pearson’s 
correlation 
coefficient. 
Probability 
values 
less 
than 
.05 
were 
considered 
significant 
in 
all 
the 
statistical 
analyses. 


3. 
Results 
The 
results 
showed 
that 
except 
for 
six 
CP 
events 
where 
GM 
or 
SI 
occurred 
both 
before 
and 
after 
CPs, 
all 
CPs 
had 
an 
SI 
or 
GM 
either 
before 
or 
after, 
or 
were 
isolated 
CPs.

Discussion 
In 
normal 
children 
and 
adolescents, 
no 
obstructive 
apnea 
longer 
than 
10 
s 
in 
duration 
has 
been 
observed 
[1], 
whereas 
30% 
of 
children 
have 
central 
sleep 
apneas 
of 
10 
s 
duration 


Table 
3 


or 
longer, 
although 
most 
of 
these 
apneas 
were 
not 
associated 
with 
desaturation 
(SpO2 
< 
90%) 
[1]. 
It 
is 
not 
known 
whether 
CP 
in 
children 
is 
pathological 
or 
not. 
In 
the 
current 
study, 
we 
tried 
to 
distinguish 
the 
temporal 
relationship 
of 
CPs 
with 
arousal 
events, 
such 
as 
SIs 
and 
GMs. 
We 
differentiated 
preceding 
from 
following 
events 
and 
investigated 
the 
seven 
types 
of 
CPs, 
SIs, 
and 
GMs. 
Each 
type 
of 
CP, 
SI, 
and 
GM 
combination 
may 
have 
a 
different 
functional 
significance. 


We 
found 
that 
isolated 
CPs 
and 
isolated 
GMs 
in 
children 
(more 
than 
15 
months 
of 
age), 
and 
isolated 
SIs 
in 
infants 
(less 
than 
15 
months 
of 
age) 
appeared 
more 
frequently 
during 
REMS 
than 
during 
NREMS. 
We 
also 
showed 
an 
age-related 
increase 
of 
isolated 
CPs, 
and 
an 
age-related 
decrease 
of 
isolated 
GMs 
and 
SIs. 
Age-related 
changes 
in 
these 
parameters 
have 
not 
been 
previously 
described. 
We 
observed 
that 
the 
average 
duration 
of 
isolated 
CPs 
during

was 
significantly

children 
as 
well 
as 
total 
CPs 
and 
other 
CPs 
during 
NREMS. 
However, 
the 
age-related 
increase 
of 
total 
CPs 
as 
well 
as 
isolated 
CPs 
and 
other 
CPs 
may 
be 
closely 
connected 
with 
our 
definition 
‘‘10 
s’’ 
as 
the 
breaking 
point 
[1,2,27] 
because 
the 
duration 
of 
respiratory 
pauses 
is 
known 
to 
increase 
with 
increasing 
age 
[28]. 


GMs 
and 
SIs 
have 
been 
recently 
proposed 
as 
clinical 
manifestations 
of 
spontaneous 
arousal 
sequences 
[8–10]. 
AccordingtoLijowskaetal. 
[8], 
arousal 
behaviors 
in 
infants 
consisted 
of 
four 
highly 
stereotyped 
behaviors: 
SIs, 
startles, 
thrashing 
limb 
movements, 
and 
full 
arousal 
(eyes 
open, 
cry). 
Thrashing 
limb 
movements 
were 
slower 
repeated 
movements 
that 
were 
characterized 
by 
head 
turning, 
truncal 
torsion, 
and 
arching 
[8]. 
This 
movement 
corresponds 
to 
GM 
in 
the 
present 
study. 
SIs 
and 
GMs 
in 
our 
study 
could 
be 
considered 
as 
episodes 
related 
to 
arousal 
responses. 
Isolated 
GMs 
in 
older 
children 
appeared 
more 
frequently 
during 
REMS 
than 
during 
NREMS. 
In 
contrast, 
isolated 
SIs 
in 
younger 
infants 
occurred 
more 
frequently 
during 
REMS 
than 
during 
NREMS. 
These 
findings 
may 
be 
related 
to 
the 
age-related 
decrease 
in 
GM 
vs. 
SI 
and 
the 
mechanisms 
underlying 
both 
the 
events. 


In 
the 
present 
study, 
we 
tried 
to 
examine 
the 
role 
of 
SIs 
and 
GMs 
in 
relation 
to 
CPs. 
Similar 
to 
isolated 
CPs, 
isolated 
SIs 
and 
GMs, 
or 
SIs 
and 
GMs 
that 
appear 
after 
CP 
occurred 
more 
frequently 
during 
REMS 
than 
during 
NREMS. 
We 
propose 
that 
CPs 
may 
be 
interrupted 
when 
followed 
by 
SIs 
and 
GMs, 
particularly 
during 
REMS. 


Similar 
to 
previous 
reports 
[1,3,10,15], 
we 
found 
that 
the 
incidence 
of 
CP 
preceded 
by 
SI 
was 
higher 
during 
NREMS 
than 
during 
REMS, 
although 
no 
systematic 
study 
has 
been 
performed 
on 
this 
event 
beyond 
early 
infancy. 
During 
NREMS, 
respiration 
is 
controlled 
by 
an 
automatic 
system 
driven 
by 
chemical 
stimuli 
[29], 
producing 
stable 
regular 
breathing 
[30]. 
A 
CP 
preceded 
by 
SI 
may 
be 
generated 
as 
a 
consequence 
of 
a 
rapid 
decline 
in 
the 
carotid 
body 
chemoreceptor 
afferent 
discharge 
due 
to 
the 
SI-induced 
increase 
in 
arterial 
oxygen 
concentration 
and 
pH, 
and 
a 
decrease 
in 
carbon 
dioxide 
[3,10,13]. 


GMs 
are 
also 
known 
to 
precede 
CPs 
[1,2,16,17,19,31], 
although 
the 
mechanisms 
remain 
to 
be 
determined. 
In 
neonates, 
CP 
preceded 
by 
GM 
has 
been 
reported 
to 
appear 
in 
all 
sleep 
states 
with 
the 
similar 
incidence 
[17,19]. 
In 
adolescents, 
all 
central 
apneas 
during 
NREMS 
were 
reported 
to 
occur 
in 
association 
with 
prior 
body 
movements 
or 
SIs 
[16]. 
No 
previous 
reports 
on 
GMs 
during 
infancy 
and 
childhood 
have 
described 
the 
current 
finding 
that 
the 
proportion 
and 
the 
frequency 
of 
CP 
preceded 
by 
GM 
increased 
significantly 
with 
age, 
and 
appeared 
more 
frequently 
during 
NREMS 
than 
REMS. 
In 
contrast, 
the 
proportion 
of 
CP 
preceded 
by 
SI 
decreased 
significantly 
with 
age 
probably 
because 
of 
rapid 
decrease 
of 
SI 
during 
early 
infancy. 


In 
the 
present 
study, 
the 
duration 
of 
apneic 
events 
in 
NREMS 
is 
significantly 
longer 
when 
CP 
is 
preceded 
by 
sigh 
(SIcp) 
or 
GM 
(GMcp) 
in 
older 
compared 
to 
younger 
children. 
The 
duration 
of 
total 
CP 
in 
NREMS 
was 
also 


longer 
in 
the 
older 
children. 
Furthermore, 
within 
the 
older 
group, 
GMcp 
events 
and 
total 
CPs 
are 
longer 
in 
duration 
during 
NREMS 
than 
during 
REMS. 
Hence, 
in 
older 
children, 
total 
CPs 
and 
arousal 
events 
preceding 
CPs 
in 
NREMS 
are 
of 
significantly 
longer 
duration. 
The 
duration 
of 
respiratory 
pauses 
is 
known 
to 
increase 
with 
increasing 
age 
[28]; 
nevertheless, 
we 
found 
that 
the 
observed 
increase 
in 
duration 
appears 
to 
depend 
on 
differences 
in 
CP 
type 
and 
sleep 
state. 
We 
propose 
that 
these 
combinations 
of 
behavior, 
apnea, 
and 
stage 
conditions 
may 
represent 
higher 
risk 
conditions 
for 
the 
older 
child. 


Finally, 
the 
incidence 
of 
isolated 
CPs 
in 
older 
children 
appeared 
more 
frequently 
during 
REMS 
than 
during 
NREMS. 
Furthermore, 
during 
REMS, 
isolated 
CPs 
were 
longer 
in 
duration, 
suggesting 
that 
it 
took 
more 
time 
to 
restart 
respiration 
under 
these 
conditions 
in 
the 
older 
children. 
More 
studies 
are 
necessary 
to 
elucidate 
differences 
in 
the 
mechanisms 
which 
terminate 
CPs 
during 
REMS 
and 
NREMS 
and 
the 
effects 
of 
age. 


CP 
preceded 
by 
SI 
has 
been 
generally 
described 
as 
postsigh 
central 
apnea 
[32]. 
In 
Leigh 
and 
other 
overlapping 
syndromes, 
‘postsigh’ 
apneic 
episodes 
are 
frequently 
observed 
in 
patients 
with 
symmetrical 
lesion 
in 
the 
bilateral 
tegmentum 
of 
the 
medulla 
oblongata 
[32]. 
Patients 
with 
Down 
syndrome 
show 
dysfunction 
of 
the 
central 
respiratory 
control 
at 
a 
brainstem 
level, 
and 
reveal 
higher 
incidence 
of 
post-SI 
and 
post-GM 
central 
apneas 
during 
NREMS 
than 
during 
REMS 
[33]. 
In 
children 
with 
congenital 
myotonic 
dystrophy 
who 
had 
hypoxic 
–ischemic 
episodes 
during 
neonatal 
periods 
and 
had 
presumable 
brainstem 
dysfunction, 
postsigh 
central 
apneas 
were 
increased 
significantly 
during 
NREMS 
than 
during 
REMS 
[34]. 


Postsigh 
apneas 
occur 
exclusively 
during 
slow 
wave 
sleep 
and 
are 
exaggerated 
by 
hypoxia 
but 
not 
by 
hypercapnia 
in 
mice 
[35]. 
Among 
CPs 
for 
at 
least 
10 
s, 
the 
sum 
of 
CP 
preceded 
by 
SI 
and 
CP 
preceded 
by 
GM 
account 
for 
about 
75% 
of 
all 
CPs 
in 
our 
study. 
Nevertheless, 
these 
CPs 
have 
sometimes 
been 
excluded 
in 
previous 
studies 
[1,27] 
because 
central 
apneas 
>20 
s 
are 
commonly 
seen 
in 
normal 
children, 
particularly 
after 
movement 
or 
SIs, 
and 
associated 
transient 
desaturation 
is 
not 
common 
[1,2,26]. 
Thus, 
especially 
in 
infants 
and 
children 
with 
cerebral 
hypoperfusion 
and/or 
functional 
brainstem 
abnormality, 
we 
should 
study 
further 
the 
risks 
of 
CP 
following 
SI 
and 
CP 
following 
GM 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
age-related 
prolongation 
of 
duration.
