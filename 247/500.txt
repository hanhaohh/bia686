Snoring and Obstructive Sleep Apnea in Children 

A 6-Month Follow-up Study 

Peter Nieminen, MD; Uolevi Tolonen, MD, PhD; Heikki Lo¨ppo¨nen, MD, PhD 

Background: Snoring children may present symptoms 
suggestive of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome 
(OSAS). Different and controversial methods to establish 
the diagnosis and to choose the treatment modalities 
have been proposed. 

Objectives: To study children with symptoms raising 
the suspicion of OSAS with overnight polysomnography 
(PSG). To evaluate the efficacy of adenotonsillectomy 
as treatment of pediatric OSAS and to elucidate the 
natural history of OSAS and primary snoring. 

Design: A controlled, prospective, nonrandomized clinical 
trial. 

Setting: Academic medical center. 

Subjects: Fifty-eight snoring but otherwise healthy children 
aged 3 to 10 years with symptoms suggestive of OSAS 
underwent PSG twice, 6 months apart. Thirty healthy children 
served as controls. 

Results: Twenty-seven children had OSAS with an obstructive 
apnea/hypopnea index greater than 1, while 31 
had primary snoring. There were statistical differences 
in the symptoms and signs among the 3 study groups. 
Adenotonsillectomy was curative in the 21 children with 
OSAS who were operated on. Obstructive apneas and hypopneas 
in the healthy, nonsnoring children were almost 
nonexistent in this study. 

Conclusions: Half of the children or fewer with symptoms 
suggestive of OSAS actually had the condition. Clinical 
symptoms may raise the suspicion, but it is not possible 
to establish the diagnosis without PSG. Because 
snoring and obstructive symptoms may resolve over time, 
a normal PSG finding may help the clinician decide on 
an observation period. Adenotonsillectomy is curative in 
most cases of pediatric OSAS. Obstructive symptoms may 
continue after adenoidectomy alone.

ORE THAN 10% of 
preschool-aged children 
snore regularly.1 
However, obstructive 
sleep apnea syndrome 
(OSAS), a condition related to snoring with 
possible serious complications if untreated,
2,3 is less common. In a recent study, 
the prevalence of OSAS was estimated at 
about 3%.4 There is no doubt about the seriousness 
of pediatric OSAS, but no universally 
accepted criteria have been developed 
for its diagnosis and treatment. 
Much lower apnea indexes and shorter apneas 
than those considered acceptable for 
adults2 have been recognized as indicators 
of OSAS in children.5,6 However, the 
natural history of mild OSAS and primary 
snoring (PS), ie, snoring with obstructive 
symptoms but nonpathologic 
polysomnography (PSG) findings, is not 
well known.7 The most common cause for 
snoring and OSAS in normal children is 
adenotonsillar hypertrophy.3 

This follow-up study was designed to 
study children with symptoms suggestive 
ofOSAS,thepresumptivecauseofthesymptoms 
being adenotonsillar hypertrophy. 
These signs and symptoms were related to 
the overnight polysomnographic (PSG) 
findings. The effect of adenotonsillectomy 
as a treatment of the syndrome was evaluated 
in a repeated study 6 months later in 
the cases with a PSG finding indicative of 
OSAS.ThechildrenwithPSwhounderwent 
no therapeutic interventions also received 
a follow-up examination 6 months later. 

RESULTS 
FIRST VISIT 

Twenty-seven of the 58 children had pathologic 
OAHIs higher than 1 (OSAS group), 
while the remaining 31 children had nonpathologic 
PSG recordings (PS group). The 
main general findings for both groups and 
the control group are given in Table 1.

SUBJECTS, METHODS, 
AND MATERIALS 

We reviewed all referrals from primary health care sites to 
the Department of Otorhinolaryngology in the Oulu University 
Hospital for adenoidectomy, tonsillectomy, or both, 
for children aged 3 to 10 years from 1994 to 1997. Parents 
of children with reported snoring, apneas, or difficult nighttime 
breathing completed a detailed questionnaire regarding 
their child’s nighttime and daytime symptoms. Children 
with known upper airway anomalies, an underlying 
disease predisposing to upper airway obstruction, asthma, 
or perennial allergy were excluded at this point. 

Based on the questionnaire responses, the children with 
obstructive symptoms underwent an ear, nose, and throat 
evaluation. Where recognized, upper airway anomalies and 
abnormal facial morphologic characteristics led to exclusion. 
After the patient history had been thoroughly updated 
and the questionnaire responses checked, 78 children 
(43 boys; mean age, 5.7 years; range, 2.4-10.5 years) 
fulfilled the inclusion criteria (ie, had symptoms suggestive 
of OSAS, were regular snorers, and/or had apneas during 
sleep, the presumable cause for the symptoms being 
adenotonsillar hypertrophy). If a child had a previous adenoidectomy, 
this did not lead to exclusion. 

The children were examined twice, 6 months apart. 
Fifty-eight children (31 boys; mean age, 5.7 years) participated 
in the entire follow-up study. Fifteen children did 
not participate in the second part of the study; in 4 cases 
there was a protocol violation, and in 1 case, technical problems. 
Thirty nonsnoring, healthy children (17 boys; mean 
age, 7.1 years) were also examined for comparison and to 
establish normative values for overnight PSG. 

CLINICAL SYMPTOMS 

The questionnare included 31 questions designed to determine 
the severity of the most typical symptoms of childhood 
OSAS. To score the symptoms, we selected those linked 
with a high risk for OSAS,8 and assigned the following numeric 
values to the symptoms of snoring, apneas, nighttime 
mouth breathing, and restless sleep: 0, never; 1, occasionally; 
2, regularly; and 3, always. Daytime somnolence 
was assigned the following values: 0, never; 1, occasionally; 
and 2, regularly. Odd sleeping positions were valued 
at 0, no; and 1, yes. The maximum score a child could have 
was thus 15. 

In addition, the obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) scoring 
system developed and presented by Brouilette and coworkers9 
was applied to our series. According to Brouilette 
et al, an OSA score greater than 0 is predictive of OSAS, 
while a score less than 0 is predictive of normality. A score 
greater than 3.5 should be considered diagnostic of OSAS, 
while a score less than -1.0 indicates absence of OSAS. The 
OSA scores between –1.0 and 3.5 may or may not indicate 
OSAS.9 There is one caveat to our analysis of the OSA scores 
in this study: we used the criterion of laborious breathing 
instead of breathing difficulties during sleep as in the original 
formula. 

CLINICAL SIGNS 

Thorough clinical ear, nose, and throat examinations were 
done. The palatine tonsils were clinically graded on a scale 
from 1 to 4, slightly modified from the standardized evaluation 
system recommended by Brodsky,10 as follows: grade 
1 tonsils remain within the tonsillar fossa; grade 2 tonsils 
do not reach the midline between the anterior faucial pillar 
and the uvula; grade 3 tonsils extend medially from the 

More children in the OSAS group than in the PS 
and control groups had had a previous adenoidectomy. 
The average palatine tonsillar size was also greater in the 
OSAS group, with 93% (25/27) having enlarged tonsils, 
while 68% (20/31) had them in the PS group and only 
3% (1/30) in the control group. 

SYMPTOMS 

On the symptom scale, the children with OSAS had a median 
value of 12 (range, 4-14), those with PS, 9 (range, 
2-14), and the controls, 1 (0-7). The mean OSA score was 

3.1 for the OSAS group, 2.1 for the PS group (P = .03 for 
difference from OSAS group), and -3.7 for the control 
group (P.01 for difference from OSAS group). The constancy 
of snoring and the frequency of nights when the 
parents had detected apneas differed between the OSAS 
and PS groups (Table 1). 
Nighttime and daytime mouth breathing and odd 
sleeping positions were significantly less common in the 
control group than in the OSAS and PS groups. Restless 
sleep was significantly more typical of the OSAS than PS 
group, 54% vs 22% (P = .03), being nonexistent in the 
control group (P.01). Excessive daytime somnolence, 
the hallmark for OSAS in adults, was rare, and only 6 children 
(23%) in the OSAS group suffered from it daily. 

POLYSOMNOGRAPHY 

The main polysomnographic results of the OSAS, PS, and 
control groups are shown in Table 2. 

Inclusion of apneas shorter than 10 seconds into the 
OAHI would not have changed the categorization. Of all 
obstructive events lasting longer than 10 seconds, hypopneas 
accounted for 76.6% in the OSAS and 98.7% in the 
PS groups. Short obstructive events were much less common 
than those lasting longer than 10 seconds in both 
groups. Central apneas did not differ among the 3 groups. 
There were no significant differences in apneic events between 
the PS group and the control group. Four children, 
3 of them in the OSAS group, had 1 central apnea each lasting 
longer than 20 seconds with desaturation below 90%. 

The 4% and 10% desaturation episodes per hour indexes, 
which indicate events with 4% and 10% drops in 
the oxygen saturation level, were manually checked. Both 
indexes were higher for the OSAS than PS group (Table 
2). Both groups had higher 4% indexes than the control 
group (Table 2). The average width of the saturation distribution, 
which shows the variation in oxygen saturation 
between the highest and lowest 10 percentiles, was 
greater in the OSAS than the PS group (P = .05), while there 
was no significant difference between the PS and control 
groups. Periods of cardiac arousals were more frequent in

cardiac arousals was 0.61 (P = .01) in the OSAS group. 

FOLLOW-UP VISIT 

Surgical Group 

Twenty-one children with OAHI greater than 2 underwent 
adenotonsillectomy shortly after the first visit. The 
results are shown in Table 3; 73% of the children operated 
on (16/21) had had previous adenoidectomies, 
which had not resolved the obstructive symptoms, or the 
symptoms had begun after the adenoidectomy. At the operation 
evaluated for this study, the epipharynx was 
checked, and none of the children appeared to have substantial 
regrowth of adenoidal tissue. 

Clinically, all children benefited from the operation. 
All the symptoms of 16 children disappeared. Fivechildren 
continuedtohavesomeminorsymptoms.Nonehadanyneed 
for additionaltreatment.Onthe symptomscale, themedian 
score for the children operated on dropped from 12 (range, 
7-15) to 1 (range, 0-6). The mean OSA score had changed 
significantly from 3.4 to –3.1 (P.01). The only child with 
apostoperative OSA score greaterthan 0 was a boy, the only 
one to still snore on most nights. The snoring was thought 

to be lighter,however,andhewasmore alertinthe daytime. 
Theother4childrencontinuedtosnoreirregularly;1ofthem 
reported still having laborious breathing at night. 

There was a distinct improvement in the PSG results 
after the operation (Table 3). All indexes except those 
for central apneas were significantly improved. The mean 
OAHI dropped from 6.9 to 0.3 (P.01). The remaining 
obstructive events were also improved, as were all hypopnea 
indexes. Two children still had pathologic OAHIs 
postoperatively: the boy mentioned above had a score of 

5.1 (8.9 at first measurement) and a girl had 1.0 (11.8 at 
first measurement). All the other children had OAHIs of 
less than 1. The periods of cardiac arousals decreased significantly, 
but did not disappear. 
Conservative Group 

According to the responses to the follow-up questionnaire, 
6 children had developed more symptoms, and their mean 
(SD; range) OSA scores had risen from 1.2 (2.3, -3.1 to 3.3) 
to2.4(2.4,-2.4to4.0),thoughtheyallhadnormalPSGfind-
ings(OAHI = 0).Fifteenchildrenhadunchangedsymptoms, 
while 16 reported decreased symptoms. The mean indexes 
in this group had not changed significantly over the follow-
up period (Table 3). Two children had abnormal OAHIs at 
the secondvisit: 1 was a boy with unchanged OAHI 2.6. For 
1 child, the OAHI increased from 0.5 to 1.0.

COMMENT 
As the number of adenoidectomies and tonsillectomies 
performed declines because of the increased use of antimicrobial 
therapy, the risk for obstructive sleep disorders 
may increase in the pediatric population.14 Children 
who snore and have symptoms suggestive of OSAS 
are frequently encountered in clinical practice. 

The natural history of mild OSAS is not well known, 
though it may be rather uneventful,7 as also suggested 
by our results. It is not known, either, how high apnea 
indexes and a long duration of OSAS are capable of producing 
complications. 

The pathologic apnea index for children is reported 
to be greater than 15 when real obstructive apneas lasting 
for at least 2 to 3 normal breath cycles are counted into

wide range of OSA scores in both groups confirms the difficulty 
of establishing a diagnosis on a clinical basis,15 and 
in many study series, only half or fewer of the children 
with suspected OSAS are proved to have it by the PSG criteria.
8,15,18,25 Most of the daytime and nighttime symptoms 
reported as typical for children with OSAS, ie, morning 
headaches, bed wetting, profuse sweating, sleepwalking, 
nightmares, irritability, concentration difficulties, and frequent 
nighttime awakenings, were quite similar among the 
OSAS and PS groups, while most of these symptoms were 
significantly less common in the control group. Only the 
habitual snoring, apneas, and restless sleep detected by the 
parents were significantly more common in the OSAS than 
the PS group. 

Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy are effective in 
the treatment of pediatric OSAS, especially when there 
is no underlying predisposition.2,3,26 This fact was confirmed 
by the present results. All children who were operated 
on improved in terms of symptoms and PSG results. 
Only 1 boy had clearly pathologic OAHI 
postoperatively, with some but notably milder obstructive 
symptoms. There was also a decline in mild hypopneainduced 
cardiac arousals, but no total disappearance. 
Could this result indicate that these children had a predisposition 
for obstructive sleep disorders? Why do some 
children snore, while some do not, with apparently similar 
facial morphologic characteristics and pharyngeal status? 
It has been proposed that primary snoring, upper 
airway resistance syndrome, and OSAS constitute a continuum.
21 Most children in the conservative group had 
periods of obstructed breathing causing cardiac arousals 
equally or more often than the children with OSAS 
postoperatively. Is there a similar tendency toward obstructed 
breathing in these children, but some difference 
in the upper airway regulatory reflexes? Deficit in 
the central ventilatory drive is probably not a major factor 
in the pathogenesis of OSAS.22 

Normal PSG findings can help the clinician justify 
an observation period for the snoring child, since the stability 
of the PSG findings in the conservative group seems 
to indicate that, during a short interval, primary snorers 
do not have a tendency to develop OSA, supporting the 
earlier findings.7 The finding that snoring may be restricted 
to a period of childhood,1 and that almost half 
of the children in the conservative group showed spontaneous 
regression of the obstructive symptoms over the 
follow-up period, further supports the idea of an observation 
period. 

A history of previous adenoidectomy in snoring children 
has been shown to be a risk factor for OSAS.8 In our 
study, most of the children with OSAS had had earlier 
adenoidectomies, which indicates that adenoidectomy 
alone is not always effective in the treatment of pediatric 
OSAS. Nor did adenoidectomy seem to have reconstituted 
nighttime nasal breathing in these children, which 
further indicates that orovelopharyngeal factors are dominant 
in producing obstructive symptoms. 

CONCLUSIONS 
Half or fewer children with symptoms suggestive of OSAS 
actually have the syndrome. Clinical symptoms may raise 

this suspicion, but the diagnosis cannot be established 
without PSG. A normal PSG finding may help the clinician 
decide on an observation period, since snoring and 
obstructive symptoms may resolve over time. Adenotonsillectomy 
is, in most cases, a curative treatment of pediatric 
OSAS, while adenoidectomy alone does not seem 
to be enough.
