Study 
objectives: 
To 
determine 
the 
prevalence 
of 
habitual 
snoring 
(HS) 
in 
1-year-old 
children, 
and 
to 
assess 
the 
relationship 
between 
HS 
and 
atopic 
status 
in 
these 
children. 
Design: 
Cross-sectional 
evaluation 
of 
a 
birth 
cohort 
selected 
from 
the 
population. 
Setting: 
Ohio 
and 
Kentucky 
River 
Valley 
communities. 
Participants: 
Children 
participating 
in 
the 
Cincinnati 
Childhood 
Allergy 
and 
Air 
Pollution 
Study 
(CCAAPS) 
were 
recruited 
for 
this 
study. 
Measurements 
and 
results: 
At 
age 
1 
year, 
the 
children 
were 
evaluated 
for 
atopic 
status 
and 
exposure 
to 
environmental 
tobacco 
smoke 
(ETS). 
Parents 
were 
asked 
to 
complete 
a 
questionnaire 
pertaining 
to 
their 
snoring 
frequency 
and 
that 
of 
their 
child. 
Children 
with 
HS 
(snoring 
three 
or 
more 
times 
per 
week) 
were 
compared 
to 
those 
who 
either 
did 
not 
snore 
or 
snored 
less 
than 
three 
times 
per 
week. 
Data 
were 
available 
on 
681 
of 
the 
700 
children 
participating 
in 
CCAAPS 
study. 
Of 
these 
681 
children 
(377 
boys 
and 
304 
girls), 
542 
were 
white 
(80%), 
118 
were 
African 
American 
(17%), 
and 
21 
were 
biracial 
or 
Asian 
(3%). 
The 
mean 
age 
(. 
SD) 
of 
our 
cohort 
at 
the 
time 
of 
assessment 
for 
snoring 
was 
13.7 
. 
2.6 
months. 
Of 
the 
681 
children, 
105 
snored 
habitually 
(15%). 
There 
was 
a 
significant 
association 
between 
HS 
and 
the 
following: 
(1) 
positive 
atopic 
status 
(p 
. 
0.005); 
(2) 
African-American 
race 
(p 
< 
0.01); 
and 
(3) 
a 
history 
of 
snoring 
in 
the 
father 
(p 
< 
0.01) 
or 
in 
the 
mother 
(p 
< 
0.01). 
There 
was, 
however, 
no 
association 
between 
HS 
and 
ETS. 
Conclusions: 
We 
found 
a 
15% 
prevalence 
of 
HS 
in 
1-year-old 
children 
born 
to 
atopic 
parents 
and 
a 
significant 
association 
with 
positive 
atopic 
status.

tant 
that 
predisposing 
factors 
for 
HS 
be 
identified 
early 
in 
life. 
As 
an 
initial 
step, 
the 
relationship 
between 
childhood 
obstructive 
SDB 
and 
common 
childhood 
diseases 
and 
environmental 
exposures 
must 
be 
determined. 
Because 
allergic 
disease 
affects 


. 
40 
million 
children 
in 
westernized 
countries 
and 
the 
incidence 
of 
allergic 
respiratory 
diseases 
is 
rising, 
we 
addressed 
the 
association 
between 
atopic 
status 
and 
HS 
in 
young 
children. 
Although 
previous 
studies7–
10 
have 
indicated 
that 
having 
a 
history 
of 
allergic 
respiratory 
diseases 
is 
a 
risk 
factor 
for 
obstructive 
SDB, 
these 
studies 
either 
have 
not 
included 
an 
objective 
assessment 
of 
atopy8–10 
or 
have 
been 
limited 
by 
referral 
bias.7 
The 
purpose 
of 
the 
present 
study 
was 
therefore 
to 
determine 
the 
prevalence 
of 
HS 
in 
1-year-old 
children 
born 
to 
atopic 
parents 
and 
to 
assess 
the 
relationship 
between 
HS 
and 
atopic 
status 
in 
these 
children, 
objectively 
assessing 
the 
latter.

Methods 


Participants 
and 
Study 
Design 


The 
Cincinnati 
Childhood 
Allergy 
and 
Air 
Pollution 
Study 
(CCAAPS) 
is 
a 
prospective 
birth 
cohort 
study 
of 
infants 
born 
to 
atopic 
parents. 
The 
study 
includes 
families 
residing 
in 
the 
Greater 
Cincinnati 
Metropolitan 
Region 
of 
southwestern 
Ohio 
and 
northern 
Kentucky, 
referred 
to 
as 
the 
Ohio 
and 
Kentucky 
River 
Valley 
region. 
Monthly 
birth 
certificate 
records 
were 
used 
to 
identify 
families 
with 
newborns. 
From 
the 
1,879 
families 
meeting 
CCAAPS 
eligibility 
criteria,11 
1,152 
families 
(72.6%) 
made 
and 
kept 
their 
appointments 
for 
a 
skin-prick 
test 
(SPT). 
There 
were 
881 
parents 
who 
were 
SPT 
positive, 
and 
700 
parents 
(80%) 
enrolled 
their 
infants, 
defined 
as 
bringing 
their 
child 
at 
his/her 
first 
birthday 
for 
an 
SPT. 
At 
age 
1 
year, 
the 
700 
children 
in 
the 
CCAAPS 
study 
were 
evaluated 
for 
atopic 
status 
and 
exposure 
to 
environmental 
tobacco 
smoke 
(ETS). 
Additionally, 
parents 
of 
these 
children 
were 
asked 
to 
complete 
a 
questionnaire 
pertaining 
both 
to 
their 
snoring 
and 
snoring 
in 
their 
child. 
Snoring 
frequency 
was 
classified 
as 
follows: 
never, 
rarely 
(less 
than 
once 
per 
week), 
sometimes 
(once 
or 
twice 
per 
week), 
frequently 
(three 
or 
four 
times 
per 
week), 
and 
almost 
always 
(five 
to 
seven 
times 
per 
week). 
HS 
was 
defined 
as 
snoring 
three 
or 
more 
times 
per 
week, 
thus 
including 
the 
latter 
two 
classifications. 
All 
children 
with 
HS 
(snoring 
three 
or 
more 
times 
per 
week) 
were 
compared 
to 
children 
with 
either 
no 
snoring 
or 
snoring 
less 
than 
three 
times 
per 
week. 


Atopic 
status 
was 
determined 
by 
a 
SPT 
to 
a 
panel 
of 
17 
aeroallergens 
and 
food 
allergens.12 
SPTs 
were 
performed 
with 
a 
bifurcated 
testing 
device 
(Accusets 
Test; 
ALK 
America; 
Round 
Rock, 
TX). 
All 
tests 
were 
administered 
and 
interpreted 
by 
an 
allergist 
who 
was 
blinded 
to 
HS 
status. 
Children 
were 
tested 
for 
both 
outdoor 
and 
indoor 
allergens, 
including 
meadow 
fescue 
and 
timothy 
grass 
pollens, 
white 
oak, 
maple 
mix, 
American 
elm, 
red 
cedar, 
short 
ragweed, 
Alternaria, 
Aspergillus 
fumigatus, 
Penicillium 
mix, 
Cladosporium, 
dust 
mite 
mix, 
German 
cockroach, 
cat, 
and 
dog. 
Foods 
tested 
included 
egg 
white 
and 
whole 
milk. 
A 
positive 
SPT 
result 
was 
defined 
as 
the 
presence 
of 
a 
wheal 
. 
3 
mm 
than 
the 
wheal 
size 
of 
control 
(saline 
solution).13 


To 
determine 
exposure 
to 
ETS, 
a 
history 
of 
maternal 
smoking 
as 
well 
as 
smoking 
by 
other 
household 
members 
was 
obtained. 


Positive 
exposure 
to 
maternal 
or 
household 
ETS 
was 
defined 
as 
consumption 
of 
one 
or 
more 
cigarettes 
per 
day 
by 
the 
mother 
or 
any 
household 
member, 
respectively. 
This 
study 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
institutional 
review 
board 
at 
University 
of 
Cincinnati, 
and 
informed 
consent 
was 
obtained 
on 
all 
subjects. 


Statistical 
Analysis 


Descriptive 
statistical 
analysis 
was 
performed 
to 
calculate 
the 
mean 
and 
median 
ages 
of 
children 
and 
their 
breakdown 
by 
gender 
and 
race. 
The 
data 
were 
stratified 
by 
the 
frequency 
of 
snoring. 
Prevalence 
rates 
for 
each 
of 
the 
snoring 
frequency 
strata 
were 
then 
calculated. 
The 
comparisons 
between 
children 
with 
HS 
and 
those 
without 
HS 
were 
performed 
using 
a 
Student 
t 
test 
for 
continuous 
variables 
and 
a 
2 
test 
for 
categorical 
variables. 
Univariate 
logistic 
regression 
analysis 
was 
performed 
to 
identify 
risk 
factors 
that 
independently 
predicted 
the 
presence 
of 
HS 
in 
participants. 
Multiple 
logistic 
regression 
analysis 
was 
then 
used 
to 
calculate 
odds 
ratios 
(ORs), 
which 
were 
adjusted 
for 
the 
effects 
of 
other 
risk 
factors 
in 
the 
model. 
Statistical 
software 
(SAS 
version 


8.2 
for 
Windows; 
SAS 
Institute; 
Cary, 
NC) 
was 
used 
for 
all 
analyses; 
p

was 
considered 
significant. 
Results 


Data 
were 
available 
on 
681

children 
in 
the 
CCAAPS 
study: 
377 
boys 
(55%) 
and 
304 
girls 
(45%). 
Of 
the 
681 
children, 
542 
were 
white 
(80%), 
118 
were 
African 
American 
(17%), 
and 
21 
were 
biracial 
or 
Asian 
(3%). 
The 
family 
income 
was

$40,000/yr 
in 
65% 
and 
. 
$40,000/yr 
in 
35% 
of 
the 
families. 
The 
mean 
and 
median 
ages 
of 
these 
children 
at 
the 
time 
of 
assessment 
for 
atopy 
and 
snoring 
were 
13.7 
. 
2.6 
months 
(. 
SD) 
and 
12.6 
months, 
respectively. 
The 
prevalence 
of 
snoring 
is 
shown 
in 
Table 
1. 
An 
absence 
of 
snoring 
was 
reported 
in 
368 
of 
682 
children; 
however, 
HS 
was 
reported 
in 
105 
children 
(15%). 
An 
increased 
prevalence 
of 
HS 
was 
reported 
in 
children 
with 
atopy 
(21.5% 
vs 
13.0%,

children 
with 
a 
parental 
history 
of 
HS 
(21.8% 
vs 
7.7%, 
p

the 
mothers 
(20%) 
and 
315 
of 
the

SPT, 
atopy 
was 
seen 
in 
195 
children 
(29%). 
Positive

Our 
cohort 
comprised 
105 
children 
who 
were 
habitual 
snorers 
(snoring 
more 
than 
three 
times 
per 
week) 
and 
576 
children 
who 
either 
did 
not 
snore 
or 
snored 
less 
than 
three 
times 
per 
week. 
Habitual 
snorers 
did 
not 
differ 
from 
others 
in 
age 
or 
gender 
(Table 
2). 
There 
was, 
however, 
a 
significant 
association 
between 
HS 
and 
the 
following: 
(1) 
positive 
atopy 
(p 
. 
0.005) 
[Table 
2]; 
(2) 
African-American 
race 
(p 
. 
0.01) 
[Table 
2], 
and 
(3) 
a 
history 
of 
snoring 
in 
the 
father 
(p 
. 
0.01) 
or 
in 
the 
mother 
(p 
. 
0.01) 
[Table 
2]. 
There 
was 
no 
association 
between 
HS 
and 
ETS, 
as 
measured 
by 
both 
maternal 
smoking 
(p 
. 
0.1) 
and 
household 
smoking 
(p 
. 
0.1) 
[Table 
2]. 
The 
presence 
of 
atopy 
increased 
the 
risk 
for 
HS 
almost 
twofold. 
This 
association 
was 
observed 
even 
after 
controlling 
for 
parental 
history 
of 
snoring, 
race, 
and 
exposure 
to 
ETS 
(OR, 
2.0; 
95% 
confidence 
interval, 
1.2 
to 
3.0) 
[Table

Discussion 


Our 
study 
is 
a 
prospective 
study 
of 
HS 
in 
a 
birth 
cohort 
selected 
from 
the 
population. 
We 
found 
a 
15% 
prevalence 
of 
HS 
in 
1-year-old 
children 
born 
to 
atopic 
parents 
and 
a 
significantly 
increased 
prevalence 
of 
HS 
in 
children 
with 
atopy 
(21.5%), 
in 
African-American 
children 
(31%), 
and 
in 
children 
with 
a 
parental 
history 
of 
HS 
(21.8%). 
Our 
overall 
HS 
prevalence 
was 
within 
the 
range 
reported 
(10 
to 
15%) 
in 
earlier 
studies 
of 
preschool14 
and 
school-age 
children.15 
This 
is 
of 
particular 
significance 
in 
light 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
obstructive 
SDB 
in 
school-age 
children 
is 
associated 
with 
permanent 
cognitive 
deficits.16 
The 
early 
identification 
and 
treatment 
of 
this 
disorder 
is 
thus 
potentially 
beneficial. 


Suit

recently 
demonstrated 
the 
association 
between 
symptoms 
of 
atopy 
and 
obstructive 
SDB 
in 
school-age 
children. 
Our 
study 
builds 
on 
these 
important 
findings 
by 
performing 
objective 
testing 
for 
atopy. 
We 
found

These 
findings 
are 
particularly 
significant 
given 
that 
allergic 
diseases 
are 
highly 
prevalent.17 
The 
upper 
airway 
inflammation 
that 
is 
present 
in 
patients 
with 
atopy 
is 
believed 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
development 
of 
obstructive 
SDB. 
Because 
exposure 
to 
ETS 
can 
lead 
to 
upper 
airway 
inflammation, 
in 
our 
analysis 
we 
controlled 
for 
the 
confounding 
effects 
of 
ETS 
on 
the 
association 
between 
HS 
and 
atopic 
status. 


Similar 
to 
the 
reported 
findings 
of 
Redline 
et 
al,18 
we 
found 
an 
increased 
prevalence 
of 
HS 
in 
African-
American 
children. 
The 
effect 
of 
race 
persisted 
even 
after 
controlling 
for 
exposure 
to 
ETS. 
This 
increased 
prevalence 
is 
believed 
to 
be 
secondary 
to 
abnormal 
ventilatory 
control 
and 
craniofacial 
development.19 
Our 
results 
also 
indicated 
that 
having 
at 
least 
one 
parent 
who 
is 
a 
habitual 
snorer 
increased 
the 
risk 
of 
HS 
by 
almost 
threefold. 
This 
finding 
corroborates 
those 
of 
previous 
reports18,19 
indicating 
the 
role 
of 
heredity 
in 
the 
development 
of 
HS 
in 
young 
children. 
It 
has 
been 
estimated 
that 
approximately 
40% 
of 
the 
variance 
in 
severity 
of 
obstructive 
SDB 
can 
be 
explained 
by 
familial 
factors.20 
It 
is 
likely 
that 
genetic 
factors 
associated 
with 
craniofacial 
structure, 
body 
fat 
distribution, 
and 
neural 
control 
of 
the 
upper 
airway 
muscles 
interact 
to 
produce 
the 
obstructive 
SDB 
phenotype.20 
Because 
our 
study 
population 
was 
much 
younger 
than 
that 
in 
the 
studies 
cited 
above, 
there 
was 
less 
opportunity 
for 
environmental 
influences; 
as 
such, 
it 
was 
an 
ideal 
population 
for 
studying 
the 
influence 
of 
genetic 
factors. 


We 
found 
no 
association 
between 
exposure 
to 
ETS 
and 
HS 
in 
children. 
Also, 
our 
results 
did 
not 
indicate 
any 
modifying 
effect 
of 
exposure 
to 
ETS 
on 
the 
association 
between 
atopy 
and 
HS. 
These 
results 
corroborate 
the 
findings 
of 
Redline 
et 
al,18 
who 
investigated 
risk 
factors 
for 
obstructive 
SDB 
in 
children. 
It 
is 
important 
to 
mention 
that 
prior 
reports9,21,22 
showing 
a 
significant 
association 
between 
tobacco 
smoke 
and 
obstructive 
SDB 
differed 
from 
our 
study 
in 
that 
they 
had 
a 
higher 
prevalence 
of 
parental 
smoking 
(54% 
vs 
27%)22 
or 
older 
study 
participants 
(age 
8 
to 
9 
years 
vs 
1 
year).9 
Having 
a 
mean 
age 
of 
13.7 
months, 
participants 
in 
our 
study 
benefited 
from 
lack 
of 
prolonged 
exposure 
to 
ETS. 


Original 
Research 



This 
suggests 
that 
a 
critical 
duration 
of 
ETS 
exposure 
may 
be 
necessary 
before 
this 
association 
can 
be 
detected. 


Childhood 
obstructive 
SDB 
is 
associated 
with 
daytime 
behavioral 
problems,2,3,23 
cognitive 
deficits,
16 
and 
cardiovascular2425 
and 
metabolic 
sequelae.
26 
As 
such, 
recommendations 
of 
the 
American 
Academy 
of 
Pediatrics 
include 
screening 
for 
obstructive 
SDB 
in 
all 
children.27 
Furthermore, 
children 
with 
symptoms 
and 
those 
at 
increased 
risk 
for 
obstructive 
SDB 
are 
advised 
to 
undergo 
objective 
overnight 
polysomnography.27 
Since 
this 
testing 
is 
expensive 
and 
currently 
available 
only 
at 
specialized 
pediatric 
centers, 
children 
who 
might 
benefit 
should 
be 
prioritized. 
Identification 
of 
predisposing 
risk 
factors 
for 
obstructive 
SDB 
will 
facilitate 
better 
utilization 
of 
resources 
as 
well 
as 
early 
detection 
and 
treatment. 
Children 
with 
highly 
prevalent 
risk 
factors 
such 
as 
allergic 
respiratory 
diseases 
should 
receive 
special 
attention. 
In 
addition, 
prospective 
studies 
are 
needed 
to 
determine 
the 
effect 
of 
environmental 
risk 
factors 
on 
the 
natural 
course 
of 
childhood 
obstructive 
SDB. 


A 
limitation 
of 
our 
study 
is 
the 
lack 
of 
objective 
testing 
for 
obstructive 
SDB. 
Although 
this 
would 
be 
ideal, 
parental-reported 
HS 
and 
objectively 
measured 
pathologic 
snoring 
have 
nevertheless 
been 
reported 
to 
have 
a 
significant 
association 
in 
young 
children.28 
The 
parents 
of 
our 
study 
subjects 
are 
also 
at 
higher 
risk 
for 
snoring 
due 
to 
their 
atopic 
status. 
Thus 
increased 
awareness 
of 
this 
disorder 
may 
have 
resulted 
in 
better 
recognition 
of 
snoring 
in 
the 
child. 
Another 
possible 
limitation 
is 
the 
underreporting 
of 
maternal 
and 
household 
smoking 
by 
parents. 
This 
could 
potentially 
result 
in 
misclassification 
of 
subjects 
and 
thereby 
affect 
results. 
Future 
studies 
should 
include 
objective 
assessment 
of 
biomarkers 
such 
as 
cotinine 
levels 
for 
classification 
of 
ETS 
exposure. 
Also, 
we 
did 
not 
have 
data 
on 
the 
sleep 
environment 
of 
these 
infants. 
This 
could 
affect 
our 
results 
due 
to 
underreporting 
of 
snoring 
in 
infants 
sleeping 
in 
their 
own 
room 
compared 
to 
those 
who 
sleep 
with 
their 
parents. 


Conclusion 


In 
a 
large 
cohort 
born 
to 
a 
parent 
with 
atopy, 
we 
found 
a 
15% 
prevalence 
of 
HS 
in 
1-year-old 
children 
and 
a 
significant 
association 
with 
positive 
atopic 
status, 
African-American 
race, 
and 
a 
parental 
history 
of 
HS. 
Given 
the 
extent 
of 
this 
problem 
in 
very 
young 
children 
and 
the 
negative 
impact 
of 
obstructive 
SDB 
on 
the 
cognitive 
functioning 
of 
school-age 
children, 
we 
strongly 
recommend 
that 
these 
high-
risk 
groups 
be 
targeted 
for 
early 
identification 
and 


www.chestjournal.org 


treatment. 
Furthermore, 
we 
recommend 
that 
longitudinal 
studies 
be 
conducted 
to 
investigate 
the 
effect 
of 
atopy 
on 
the 
natural 
course 
of 
childhood 
obstructive 
SDB.
