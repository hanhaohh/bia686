Study Objectives: Children with attention-deficit/hyperactive disorder 
(ADHD), in spite of being hyperactive, still benefit from treatment with 
stimulant medications. We hypothesized that children with ADHD are in 
fact sleepy during the day, and we sought to test it objectively. 
Design: Single blind comparative study 
Setting: University medical center 
Participants: Thirty-four children with a previous diagnosis of ADHD 
(mean age ± SD, 12.4 ± 4.6 years) and 32 matched controls (mean age, 

12.0 ± 3.6 years ). 
Interventions: N/A. 
Measurements: All participants underwent a full-night polysomnographic 
study followed by a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). 
Results: Sleep latency, total sleep time, and sleep efficiency were comparable 
between the groups, yet children with ADHD were significantly 
sleepier during the day than those in the control group (mean MSLT score 
of 21.9 ± 5.5 minutes versus 27.9 ± 2.0 minutes, P < .005). Of the children 
with ADHD, 17 (50%) had signs of sleep-disordered breathing, compared 
with 7 of the control group (22%, P < .05). Five of the ADHD group 
had periodic limb movements during sleep (15%) versus none in the control 
group. Children without sleep-disordered breathing or periodic limb 
movements during sleep had the lowest nocturnal sleep efficiency and 
total sleep time. 
Conclusions: We conclude that children with ADHD demonstrate objective 
daytime somnolence, which may explain the beneficial effects of treatment 
with stimulant medications. Primary sleep disorders, especially 
sleep-disordered breathing and periodic limb movement disorder, should 
be looked for in children with ADHD.

history was suggestive of adenoid enlargement, a lateral neck radiograph 
was performed. All children (ADHD and controls) with sleep apnea 
(once diagnosed) were referred to an ear, nose, and throat evaluation. 

Measures 

History and Questionnaires 

All participants underwent medical evaluation by an experienced 
sleep physician and completed the Technion Sleep Questionnaire, which 
includes information regarding sleep habits and potential sleep disturbances, 
as well as questions regarding daytime behavior. In addition, the 
participants underwent a brief physical examination focusing on upper-
airway examination searching for hypertrophy of tonsils or adenoids. 

Polysomnography 

All participants underwent a full-night sleep study at the sleep laboratory 
in Rambam Medical Center. Children were studied for at least 7 
hours in a quiet darkened room in the company of 1 of their parents. No 
medications were used to induce sleep. The following parameters were 
measured: 2 channels of electroencephalogram (C3-A2 and O2-A1), 
electrooculogram, chin and anterior tibialis electromyograms, chest and 
abdominal wall movement (piezoelectric electrodes), electrocardiogram, 
and air flow (thermistor). Arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) was 
assessed by pulse oximetry, and end-tidal CO2 levels by capnograph. All 
measures were digitized using a commercially available polysomnography 
system (EEG 4214; Nihon Kohden, Kogyo Co, Tokyo, Japan, or 
Embla system, Flaga hf, Iceland). 

Sleep was staged according to standard criteria. The time in bed was 
defined as the time between lights off and lights on. Sleep latency was 
defined as the time from lights off to the first 3 epochs of stage 1 sleep, 
and the sleep period time, as the time from falling asleep to lights on in 
the morning. Sleep efficiency was calculated as the percentage of actual 
sleep time versus time in bed. Awakenings from sleep were scored and 
presented based on the duration until falling back to sleep. Arousals from 
sleep were defined as any electroencephalographic frequency change for 
3 seconds in non-rapid eye movement sleep and any such change associated 
with body movement or increase in electromyogram during rapid 
eye movement (REM) sleep. Respiratory events were scored according 
to the common practice for measurement in children,30 with some modifications. 
Apneas were defined as the complete cessation of breathing 
for at least 2 breath cycles, and hypopneas, as any notable decrement in 
ventilation for at least 2 breath cycles, if the hypopnea was associated 
with a decrease of at least 3% in SpO2, an increase in end-tidal CO2, or

arousal from sleep. The respiratory disturbance index (RDI) was calculated 
as the number of apneas plus hypopneas divided by the total number 
of hours of sleep. Children with an RDI greater than 2 were considered 
as having sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Periodic limb movements 
were also counted (based on International Classification of Sleep 
Disorders criteria) and divided by the total sleep time to form the PLM 
index. Children with a PLM index greater than 5 were considered as 
having periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD). 

Multiple Sleep Latency Test 

Objective sleepiness was assessed by the multiple sleep latency test 
(MSLT), which we have modified for children. All participants underwent 
an MSLT during the day following the whole-night sleep study, 
during which subjects were given 5 opportunities to fall asleep every 2 
hours (8:00 AM, 10:00 AM, noon, 2:00 PM, 4:00 PM). The traditional 
20-minute nap opportunities were modified and extended to 30-minute 
opportunities. For every nap, subjects were requested to lie in bed in a 
dark, quiet, and comfortable room, with no external stimulation. The 
parents were allowed to remain in the room. Sleep latency for each trial 
was measured from the time of lights out to the first epoch of sleep. If 
subjects did not fall asleep after 30 minutes, the nap was terminated, and 
sleep latency for that nap was assigned a value of 30 minutes. If subjects 
fell asleep during the nap, they were allowed to sleep for 15 minutes to 
examine whether REM sleep occurred, at which point 1 minute of REM 
sleep was permitted or the test was terminated. Daytime sleepiness 
(based on the MSLT results) was determined from the average of the 5 
sleep latencies. Additional variables included the number of naps in 
which the subject fell asleep and the number of REM-sleep occurrences. 

Protocol 

All participants underwent a medical interview, filled out questionnaires, 
and underwent a brief physical examination prior to the sleep 
study. On the sleep-study night, participants reported to the sleep lab 
between 8:00 PM and 9:00 PM, electrodes were attached, and the bedtime 
was requested to be no later than midnight. Sleep was monitored 
until 7:00 AM the following morning. Then, the MSLT was performed. 
All studies were scored blindly (ie, the scorer was blinded to the group 
in which the child belonged) by an experienced PSG technologist and 
then carefully assessed by the principle investigators. 

Data Analysis 

All variables were inserted into a database program (Microsoft Excel, 
Microsoft, Redmond, Wash), and comparisons were made between the 
control and study groups (unpaired t test). Within each group, primary 
sleep disorders were diagnosed, and their prevalence in each group was 
compared using .2 test for proportions. Finally, within the study group, 
the population was divided into subgroups according to sleep disorders 
found, and various variables were compared using unpaired t test and 
analysis of variance. In all comparisons a P value of less than .05 was 
considered statistically significant. 

RESULTS 

Complete data sets are available on 61 of the participants. Two children 
from the ADHD group and 3 children from the control group completed 
only questionnaires and night studies but left the laboratory without 
completing the MSLT. 

Table 1 shows the polysomnographic measures of the ADHD and control 
groups. The sleep architecture did not differ significantly between 
the groups, with the exception of percentage of REM sleep, which was 
higher in the ADHD group (Table 1). Awakenings from sleep were also 
similar between the groups, although the arousal index was higher in the 
ADHD than in the control group. The frequencies of SDB and PLM 
were higher in the ADHD group than in controls, and the average RDI 
was 2.5-fold higher in the ADHD group compared to the control group

(Table 1). Importantly, there was a significant correlation between (Table 3). The SaO2 was significantly higher in the NPSD group than in 

arousal index and RDI (r = 0.62, P < .05). 

The MSLT data are presented in Figure 1. Mean sleep latency was 
shorter in the ADHD group than in the control group (21.9 ± 2.6 minutes 
vs 27.9 ± 1.85 minutes, P < .005). There were significant differences in 
the sleep latencies between the groups in 4 of the 5 daytime trials (except 
for the noon trial). There were 23 (14%) sleep latencies shorter than 10 
minutes in 13 children in the ADHD group, as compared to 3 (2%) in 3 
children of the control group. Table 2 shows the number and percentage 
of children in the 2 groups who fell asleep on each trial of the MSLT. Of 
the 32 children with ADHD who went through the MSLT, 31 (96%) fell 
asleep at least once (8 fell asleep once, 9 twice, and 14 fell asleep more 
than 2 times) versus 19 (65%) of the 29 controls (14 fell asleep once, 5 
twice, and 0 fell asleep more than 2 times). 

Within the ADHD group, 17 children had some degree of SDB (50%), 
5 children had PLMD (15%, mean PLM index of 13 ± 2 per hour), and 
the remaining 13 children had no primary sleep disorder (NPSD). The 
children in these groups did not differ significantly in age, sex, and body 
mass index, as shown in Table 3. 

The polysomnographic measures of the children with ADHD were 
categorized according to the primary sleep disorder found (Table 3). The 
children with PLM had significantly higher percentages of REM sleep 
and more awakenings (1-3 minutes) than did the children with SDB or 
the NPSD (“pure ADHD”) children. Interestingly, the NSPD subgroup 
had the lowest sleep efficiency and total sleep time. 

Because 3 of the children in the PLM group also had SDB, the average 
RDI in the PLM subgroup was higher than in the NPSD subgroup

did not differ significantly except at the fifth trial (4:00 PM), in 
which the PLM subgroup had the shortest sleep latency (P < .05), as 
shown in Figure 2. 

DISCUSSION 

The results of this study indicate that children with ADHD demonstrate 
nocturnal sleep disturbances and objective daytime somnolence 
and are in support of our hypothesis. Sleep latency, total sleep time, and 
sleep efficiency were comparable between the groups. Yet, children with 
ADHD were significantly sleepier during the day. Fifty percent of them 
were found to suffer from some degree of SDB (vs 22% of the control 
group), and 15% of them had PLMD (versus none in the control group). 
However, surprisingly, within the ADHD group, children with SDB were 
not sleepier than children without SDB. Children with NPSD had the 
lowest nocturnal sleep efficiency and total sleep time. 

The observation that children with ADHD may fail more frequently 
during repetitive tasks than in single short-lived tasks has led Weinberg 
and Harper31 to suggest the hypoarousal theory as a possible underlying 
mechanism for ADHD. According to this theory, children with alleged 
ADHD are in fact sleepy and use excessive motor activity as a method 
to stay alert. This theory is also supported by parental reports that children, 
when extremely tired, tend to be angry, aggressive, and overactive.
19,24 Indeed, experimental sleep restriction may lead to ADHD-like 
behavior.25,26 Moreover, the use of stimulants, which increases catecholamine 
activity in the central nervous system and induces alertness in 
normal individuals, is the best medical treatment for children with 
ADHD, resulting in paradoxical reduction of their excessive motor 
activity.8,22,23 Thus, it seems reasonable that children with ADHD are 
actually sleepy during the day, although this has not directly been largely 
tested. Lecendreux et al29 have studied 30 boys aged 5 to 10 years and 
reported that they were sleepier during the day, although primary sleep 
disorders could not be assessed because respiratory or movement channels 
were not recorded. However, there are several reports linking primary 
sleep disorders and ADHD.15-19,27,32-35 In our study, more than 50%

of the children with ADHD had a primary sleep disorder, although they 
were all sleepy during the day independent of whether or not they had a 
primary sleep disorder. It should be kept in mind, however, that the number 
of children in the various subgroups was rather small, which may be 
too low to discover mild differences between the groups. 

Assessment of objective sleepiness in children has not been standardized. 
Although the MSLT is currently considered the gold standard, it is 
infrequently used in children and will conventionally allow for a 20minute 
nap opportunity.36 However, preadolescent children are not likely 
to fall asleep within this time period, and, therefore, a 30-minute nap 
opportunity has been suggested.26,27,37,38 Because our patients’ ages were 
heterogeneously distributed, we selected the 30-minute trials for all par-

†Indicates that the marked group significantly defers from the other 2. 
ticipants, thereby reducing the likelihood of missing a true difference 
between the ADHD and control groups. In healthy prepubertal children, 
the average sleep latency on the MSLT has been reported to be 23.7 minutes,
27 23.5 minutes,26 26.4 minutes,37 and 26.2 minutes,38 and in our 
control subjects, the mean MSLT score was slightly higher (27.9 minutes), 
perhaps due to the wide range of ages. However, it is possible that 
the results by Lecendreux et al (16.7 versus 18.9 minutes) are somewhat 
underestimating the real differences in daytime sleepiness between children 
with ADHD and controls, since they gave their children only a 20minute 
opportunity to fall asleep.29 Our findings are in agreement with 
those of Lecendreux et al,29 indicating that these children are sleepy 
throughout the day and not only at a particular time. The mean sleep 
latency of the ADHD group in our study was significantly shorter than 
that of the control group in 4 of the 5 trials of the MSLT. 

The daytime sleepiness in our group was not driven by some very 
sleepy children but, rather, was found in most of the children with 
ADHD. Thirty-one children in the ADHD group (96%) fell asleep at 
least once on the MSLT, and 23 (71%) fell asleep twice or more versus 
19 (65%) and 5 (17%), respectively, in the control group. Sleep was significantly 
more fragmented in the ADHD group, as evidenced by the 
higher arousal index in this group. However, arousal index significantly 
correlated with RDI (r = 0.62, P < .05) but did not correlate well with 
daytime sleepiness (MSLT score). Thus, it seems that children with 
ADHD are sleepy during the day without a direct association with SDB. 
Interestingly, unlike the familiar noontime sleepiness seen in the control 
group, the most severe sleepiness in the ADHD group was recognized in 
the first trial of the morning (8:00 AM, Figure 1). This may raise the possibility 
of a tendency toward delayed sleep phase syndrome. However, 
children with ADHD actually went to sleep at the same time, with a tendency 
toward shorter sleep latency, longer total sleep time, and higher 
sleep efficiency (Table 1), which makes the diagnosis of a delayed sleep 
phase syndrome unlikely. Thus, we have no good explanation why their 
nadir of sleepiness occurred in the early morning. One potential explanation 
(for the sleepiness in general and the early-morning sleepiness in 
particular) is a different response to mild sleep restriction. Since the total

of sleep (PLM) (cut line), and the group with ADHD and no primary sleep disorder (“pure ADHD”) (solid line). In the fifth trial, the sleep latency of the PLM subgroup was shorter 
than that of the others.

sleep time in both groups was relatively short (around 6.5 hours), we 
cannot rule out that the sleepiness found in the ADHD group represents 
a different response to sleep deprivation rather than a pure daytime 
sleepiness. In order to examine this, we performed a subanalysis on the 
results of the MSLT in the ADHD and control groups, selecting only 
children who had 8 hours of total sleep time. The ADHD group had a 
mean MSLT score of 22.2 ± 6.7 minutes, which was 26.5 ± 3.7 minutes 
in the controls (P = .16). Thus, the same trend holds for those with sufficient 
total nocturnal sleep time, although not reaching significance 
(probably due to the small number of subjects). Another potential explanation 
is the effect of withdrawal from methylphenidate. However, 
methylphenidate has a very short half-life, and 3 days off medication 
prior to the study should eliminate potential withdrawal effects.39 

In our study, children with ADHD demonstrated increased REM sleep 
compared to controls (21.5% versus 18.9%). Previous studies revealed 
conflicting results regarding REM sleep and ADHD, and the association 
between them at this point is unclear. While O’Brien et al35 reported 
decreased REM sleep in subjects with ADHD and speculated on the possible 
effect on learning and memory consolidation, others found no 
REM-sleep differences between ADHD and controls.29,40 In our study it 
seems that the REM-sleep difference between the groups results from 
decreased REM sleep in the control group rather than increased REM 
sleep in the ADHD group. This may be partially explained by the reported 
tendency of children (especially adolescents) to fall asleep late, and 
when awakened too early, they may miss the expected morning REM 
sleep.41 Because sleep apnea (particularly in children) tends to worsen 
during REM sleep, higher percentages of REM sleep may contribute to 
the increased rates of SDB that we found in the ADHD group. 

Interpretation of the results in view of the primary sleep disorders 
found is rather complicated. On the one hand, the frequency of SDB or 
PLMD in the ADHD group is very high, while on the other, the children 
with a primary sleep disorder were not sleepier than those without it. 
One possible explanation is that the etiology of ADHD varies, and some 
of the children may suffer from a “primary (idiopathic) ADHD,” while 
others may suffer from ADHD secondary to a nocturnal sleep disorder. 
This speculation is supported by reports that children with a primary 
sleep disorder develop ADHD, which may improve when the sleep disorder 
is treated.1,15-19,27,28,33,35,42 If this speculation is correct, then our 
results suggest that in the “primary ADHD,” with no SDB or PLMD, the 
neurologic disorder causes substantial sleep fragmentation, since in this 
group we observed the worst sleep efficiency. 

In a recent population-based study, O’Brien et al35 reported that, in 
children with either severe or no ADHD, the prevalence of obstructive 
sleep apnea was 5%, soaring up to 26% in mild ADHD. We have not 
rated the severity of our ADHD group, but O’Brien’s findings suggest 
that when the ADHD characteristics are mild, this may represent a secondary 
disorder, which should be diagnosed as obstructive sleep apnea 
rather than as primary ADHD. The 50% rate of SDB that we found in 
this study is surprisingly high and may represent the minimal criteria we 
chose to define SDB. In children, SDB is not completely defined, with 
variable lengths of events as well as the definition of hypopneas used 
previously.30,43,44 This has lead to a wide variability of reports regarding 
the prevalence of this disorder in children.30,43-45 Using the esophageal 
pressure technique, Guilleminault and Pelayo reported that the prevalence 
of OSA in children is 11%.45 In a recent study by Gottlieb et al of 
5-year-old children,46 a 25% rate of symptoms of SDB was reported in 
the general population. The children in the current study did not complain 
of daytime sleepiness, and we elected to compare SDB (and not 
frank obstructive sleep apnea) between our groups, defining SDB as an 
RDI of greater than 2. This may partially explain the high prevalence of 
SDB we found, although measuring respiration with nasal pressure 
rather than thermistors could have increased the finding even further. 
Another potential explanation is a possible selection bias. We recruited 
our study children from special ADHD clinics. From the time of study 
approval by the Institutional Review Board, all patients at the clinic were 
invited to participate (unless they suffered from additional medical dis


eases). We do not have data on those children who chose not to participate. 
It is possible that children who snore or struggle with breathing 
during sleep were more likely to participate. This (and the definition criteria 
used) may also explain the relatively high rate of SDB in our control 
group (22%). Although we asked for healthy children, it is possible 
that some families were aware of some snoring and thus had an incentive 
to participate. Yet, we believe the prevalence of SDB in children 
with ADHD is very high, and this disorder must be looked for in these 
children. This finding is also in agreement with several previous reports, 
which found a close association between obstructive sleep apnea and 

ADHD.10,15,17-19,21,32,33,35,40,47 

The finding of a 15% rate of PLMD in children with ADHD concurs 
with the results from several other studies.15,17,32,34,40 Similar to SDB, 
PLMD may result in sleep fragmentation and subsequent daytime somnolence. 
The association between PLMD and ADHD is further supported 
by the improvement of behavior when PLMD is treated.34,40,48,49 
Chervin and Archbold17 even found a dose-dependent association 
between hyperactivity (assessed by the Conners questionnaire) and the 
PLM index. Although PLMD may result from iron deficiency, it is classically 
alleviated by dopaminergic agents.34,48,49 Catecholamine dysregulation 
(dopaminergic dysfunction, in particular, and norepinephrine, 
indirectly) has been suggested to play a significant role in the pathophysiology 
of ADHD,8 and it is possible that PLMD and ADHD may 
share a similar, yet unidentified, neurochemical abnormality. PLMD is a 
relatively uncommon disorder among children, and our finding—as well 
as others’—of a high rate of this disorder in children with ADHD suggests, 
again, the possibility of secondary ADHD. 

Our study has several limitations. First, the ADHD group as a whole 
had a slightly but significantly higher body mass index than did the control 
group. Although still within normal limits, heavier individuals are 
more likely to suffer from SDB, although in children, weight is less 
important than in adults. Second, we did not evaluate our participants for 
ADHD but recruited them only after the diagnosis was performed in specific 
clinics. Because these were neurologic and psychiatric clinics, 
these children may represent the more-severe spectrum of these children. 
Third, half of the control subjects were previously studied, which may 
introduce a selection bias. However, these were taken as a whole without 
any further selection, thus we believe they do represent the normal 
range for this age. Finally, both sleep architecture and daytime sleepiness 
may change with pubertal stage and, theoretically, some of the differences 
between the groups may result from a different Tanner stage 
(which was not assessed in the study). However, the similar age and sex 
distribution in the 2 groups makes this explanation unlikely. 

In conclusion, despite these limitations, we believe that the results of 
this study suggest that primary sleep disturbances in children with 
ADHD could be related to some extent to the neurologic phenotype and 
should be looked for when evaluating children with ADHD. The substantial 
objective daytime somnolence of these children supports the 
hypoarousal theory in this disorder. This could explain the beneficial 
effects of stimulant medications.
