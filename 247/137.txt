Objective: To examine links between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), insulin 

resistance, and dyslipidemia. 
Study design: Obese (body mass index [BMI] >95th percentile for age and 
gender) children who snored (n = 62, 46 males, age 10.89 [5-16 years] underwent 
polysomnography and metabolic studies. 


Results: Respiratory disturbance index (RDI) was 9.23 (0-95), with 23 children 
(39%) recommended for treatment. Fasting insulin levels were 154.6 
pmol/L ± 79.8 (52-486), and fasting glucose levels were high in 7 children 
(11%). Fasting insulin levels correlated with sleep variables, including log 
transformed RDI (log10RDI) (P = .01), desaturation events (P = .05), arousal 
index (P = .01), and sleep-time with oxygen saturation in arterial blood <90% 
(P = .03) (adjusted r2 = 0.21, F = 3.9, P = .005), but not with age, or BMI Z 
score. Log10RDI correlated with fasting insulin (P = .001) and BMI Z score (P 
= .03) (adjusted r2 = 0.12, F = 3.9, P = .005), but not age or other metabolic variables. 
The correlation between log10RDI and fasting insulin persisted in models 
combining sleep and metabolic variables: log10RDI, adjusted r2 = 0.75, F = 
35.2, P < .001, and for fasting insulin, adjusted r2 = 0.42, F = 6.1, and P < .001. 


Conclusions: The severity of OSA (log10RDI) correlated with fasting insulin 
levels, independent of BMI. Insulin levels may be further elevated as a consequence 
of OSA in obese children. (J Pediatr 2002;140:654-9)

metabolic syndrome” with insulin resistance, 
or the relative failure of insulin 
action being a hallmark of the disorder.

bidity and mortality.11 A popular hypothesis 
is that hypoxia leads to an increased 
sympathetic neural discharge 
and, thus, to insulin resistance.12 Evidence 
has been accumulating to support 
this hypothesis, including associations 
between OSA and increased plasma cat-
echolamines,13-15 elevated cortisol levels,
16 increased insulin levels,17,18 and 
dyslipidemia.18,19 

We hypothesized that the link between 
OSA and insulin resistance commences 
in childhood. To test whether 
obese children with OSA have insulin 
resistance and metabolic derangement, 
overnight sleep studies were undertaken 
with concurrent metabolic evaluation in 
obese children who snored. We found 
that the severity of OSA was linked to 
fasting insulin levels, and therefore, disturbance 
in the insulin-glucose axis. 

PATIENTS AND 
METHODS 

Obese children with a history of snoring 
were eligible for the study. Obesity 
was defined as a body mass index (BMI; 
weight/height2) >95th percentile for age 
and sex reference values.20 Children 
were excluded from the study if they had 
an intercurrent respiratory tract infection, 
a neuromuscular disorder, or they 
were being treated with anticonvulsant 
or sedative medication. Children were 
recruited from a range of hospitals and 
private clinics, as well as primary referrals 
to the 2 major pediatric hospitals in 
Sydney (Sleep Units of the Children’s 
Hospital at Westmead and the Sydney 
Children’s Hospital). The studies were 
conducted in the Sleep Unit at Children’s 
Hospital at Westmead. 

A comprehensive physical examination 
was performed on all patients. 
During a single overnight hospitalization, 
a sleep study was performed, and 
anthropometric measurements and a 
fasting blood sample were taken. The 
study had institutional ethics committee 
approval, and the parents of each child 
gave written consent before the study.

Analysis of Sleep Studies 

Sleep studies were analyzed by one 
of the principal investigators (R. C. E. 
or K. A. W.). Sleep stages were assigned 
with the criteria of Rechtschaffen 
and Kales.23 Respiratory events 
were defined by a fall in baseline amplitude 
of the airflow signal. An apnea 
was marked when airflow amplitude 
was =20% of the baseline, and hypopnea 
when amplitude was 20% to 60% 
of the baseline. Respiratory events 
were designated obstructive if respiratory 
efforts persisted on diaphragm 
EMG and/or chest and abdominal 

movements, or central if there were 
no respiratory efforts. Respiratory 
events were considered significant if 
they were of at least 2 respiratory cycles 
duration (based on the respiratory 
rate of the preceding minute) and 
terminated by an arousal and/or de-
saturation of =3%.24 Respiratory disturbance 
index (RDI) was defined as 
the number of respiratory events per 
hour of sleep time, calculated as (total 
number of central and obstructive apneas 
+ hypopneas)/total sleep time in 
minutes  60. 

Two types of arousal were defined 
for the use in this study: “full EEG 
arousal” and “movement arousal.” A 
full EEG arousal was defined as a 

marked increase in EEG frequency or 
amplitude for >1 second, associated 
with an increase in submental EMG 
tone and a marked variability in respiratory 
efforts and nasal airflow. A 
movement arousal was defined as a 
large change in =2 independent channels 
(eg, the EMGs and respiratory 
effort channels) without EEG disturbance 
for >1 second.25 Parameters for 
TcCO2 included range (the difference 
between a stable baseline during 
wakefulness and peak levels in sleep), 
peak and average for rapid-eye movement 
(REM) and non-REM sleep. 
SaO2 parameters included maximum, 
minimum, and average. Sleep efficiency 
refers to the percentage of the total 
recording time spent asleep. Respiratory 
disturbance index (RDI) was defined 
as the number of respiratory 
events per hour of sleep time. 

Metabolic Studies 

On the night of the sleep study, patients 
fasted from 12 AM until the 
blood collection at 6 AM the following 
day. Plasma levels of glucose, insulin, 
cholesterol (HDL and total) and 
triglycerides were analyzed in the Department 
of Biochemistry and the 
Ray Williams Institute of Paediatric 
Endocrinology at the Children’s Hospital 
of Westmead. Lipid and glucose 
profiles were measured on a Beckman 
CX5 high performance liquid chromatography 
automated analyzer (Beckman 
Instruments Inc, Fullerton, 
Calif). Glucose concentrations were 
measured using the glucose oxidase 
method. Total cholesterol and triglyceride 
levels were analyzed using 
standard enzymatic colorimetric procedures. 
HDL cholesterol was measured 
after precipitation of other 
lipoproteins using PEG 6000, a 
method for lipid quantification. Plasma 
specimens for insulin determination 
were frozen within 2 hours of 
collection and stored at –20°C until 
they were assayed. All samples were 
assayed in duplicate within 2 weeks of 
collection. The insulin levels were de

termined using the Linco Human Insulin 
Specific Radioimmunoassy Kit 
(Linco Research, Inc, St Charles, 
Mo). Interassay coefficients of variation 
for quality controls were 8.2% at 
64 pmol/L, 8.0% at 249 pmol/L, and 
6.8% at 752 pmol/L. Samples were reanalyzed 
if the coefficient of variation 
of the duplicates was >10%. 

Statistical Analysis 

Data were analysed using SPSS for 
Windows version 9.0 (SPSS Inc, 
Chicago, Ill). Results are presented as 
mean ± SD unless otherwise stated. 
RDI was log-transformed to correct 
for skewed distribution. Backward, 
stepwise multiple regression was used 
to develop models that predicted the 
major determinants of the RDI and 
fasting insulin levels. Age and BMI Z 
scores were initially included in each 
multiple regression analysis. A P value 
of < .05 was considered statistically significant. 


RESULTS 

Patient Characteristics 

Obese children (n = 62, 46 males) 
aged 5 years to 16 years (mean ± SD, 

10.9 ± 3.2) were recruited (Table I). 
The mean Z score for the BMI was 3.48 
± 1.88 kg/m2 (range, 1.7-11.8) indicating 
morbid obesity in the majority. 
Mean fasting insulin levels on the 
morning after the sleep study were 

154.6 ± 79.8 pmol/L (range, 52-486). 
Mean plasma glucose level was 4.94 ± 
0.61 mmol/L, and fasting glucose was 
elevated in 7 children (11%). There was 
a wide variation in RDI values for the 
patients, with a median RDI of 3.4 hr–1 
(range, 0-95.4). The mean sleep efficiency 
was 73.7% ± 15.1%. The mean 
arousal index was not elevated for our 
laboratory at 10.6 hours ± 8.1 hours–1. 
The average desaturation with respiratory 
events was 3.3% ± 2.0%. Respiratory 
events occurred most commonly 
during REM sleep, (median RDI in 
REM sleep, 4.3 hr–1), and at wake-
sleep transition (stages 1 and 2). Sleep

study analyses are summarized in Table 

II. Note that there were children with a 
“zero” RDI in this study population. 
Regression Analyses 

Our first analysis was to determine 
which sleep study variables correlated 
with fasting insulin levels, including age 
and BMI Z score in the analysis. Fasting 
insulin correlated with log10RDI 
(P = .002), arousal index (P = .01), lowest 
SaO2 (P = .02), and time spent with 
<90% SaO2 (P = .03) with an adjusted r2 
of 0.27 (F = 3.7, P = .006). BMI Z scores 
were not significantly correlated with 
fasting insulin in this model. The results 
of multiple regression analysis for predicting 
insulin levels are shown graphically 
in the Figure, with the equation: 

Insulin = 7.9(age) + 41.7 
(log10RDI) + 40.3 

Because it remains possible that insulin 
resistance promotes OSA, a second 
analysis was undertaken to 
determine which metabolic variables 
correlated with the severity of OSA 
(log10RDI), including age and BMI Z 
score in the analysis. Log10RDI correlated 
with the BMI Z score (P = .03) 
and fasting insulin (P = .001), with an 
adjusted r2 of 0.15 (F = 4.9, P = .01). 
Insulin was the only measured meta-

DE LA EVA ETAL 

bolic parameter that correlated with 
log10RDI from the fasting blood sample. 
The regression equation was: 

Log10RDI = 0.07(BMI Z score) + 
0.002(Insulin in pmol) + 0.19 

Multiple regression analysis was then 
repeated for insulin and for log10RDI to 
determine the relative contribution of 
both metabolic and sleep study variables. 
Age and BMI Z scores were, 
again, initially included. For fasting insulin, 
significant correlations were present 
for age (P = .02), glucose (mmol/L, 
P = .002), time <90% SaO2 (P = .03), 
arousal index (P = .007), and log10RDI 
(P = .02). The adjusted r2 for fasting insulin 
was 0.42 (F = 5.5, P < .001) (Table 
III). When log10RDI was used as the 
outcome measure, significant correlations 
were present, with fasting insulin 
(P = .001), TcCO2 range (wake-tosleep, 
P = .003), lowest SaO2 (P < .001), 
and arousal index (P < .001). Note that 
BMI Z scores did not correlate with 
log10RDI. For log10RDI, adjusted rwas 0.75 (F = 37.2, P < .001) (Table IV). 
Thus, whether fasting insulin or 
log10RDI was used as the outcome 
measure, the independent and significant 
correlation between these 2 variables 
persisted after adjusting for other 
sleep study and metabolic variables.

DISCUSSION 

This study evaluated the association 
between OSA and insulin resistance in 
children; studies have shown similar 
perturbations in adult populations. We 
have demonstrated that the severity of 
OSA relates to fasting insulin levels in 
obese children. The severity of OSA 
was independently correlated with fasting 
insulin levels, after accounting for 
age and BMI. Stoohs et al10 showed 
that the association between insulin resistance 
and OSA was BMI-dependent 
in adults. The BMI range (15-39 
kg/m2) shows that nonobese patients 
were included in Stooh’s study. Our patients 
were more homogeneously obese 
because it was an inclusion criterion. It 
is possible that if nonobese children 
were included, BMI Z scores could become 
another important predictor of 
the severity of OSA. Nonetheless, this 
result leads us to hypothesise that 
OSA, as measured by RDI, has a more 
significant effect on insulin levels in 
children than the level of obesity. We 
used total RDI in our analysis, thus accounting 
for obstructive hypopneas 
and central events, as well as obstructive 
apneas. The correlations remained 
significant if obstructive events were 
considered alone. In nonobese diabetic 
children without OSA and with no 
clinical evidence of autonomic nervous 
dysfunction, poor glycemic control has 
been shown to be a risk factor for central 
apnea during sleep.32 Any component 
of the association demonstrated 
here, attributable to central apnea, 
would be small relative to that shown 
for OSA. 

Fasting insulin levels were used as a 
proxy measure of insulin resistance, 
consistent with other population studies. 
To optimize correlations, authors 
often recommend formulas that combine 
insulin with other metabolic indices 
(eg, triglycerides33 or glucose) in 
the “homeostasis model assessment.”34 
These formulas did not improve correlations 
in our study, and the frequent 
sampling required for the glucose clamp 

technique35 was not possible in this 
population. It remains possible that insulin 
resistance promotes OSA. A study 
of the metabolic profile in nonobese 
children who have OSA may help to 
answer whether insulin resistance is 
part of the original pathologic features 
of the metabolic syndrome. 

We chose multiple linear regression 
analysis because all patients in this 
study had fasting insulin levels above 
normal reference range of 5 µU/mL 
(using a conversion to pmol/L of 7.5, 
this equates to 37.5 pmol/L), with the 
lowest value in the group being 50 
pmol/L.36 Similarly, all children in this 
study had an insulin:glucose ratio >10. 
There is no one true “cut-off” when assessing 
“hyperinsulinemia” in this population, 
and the variability in insulin 
levels simply reflects the degree of insulin-
resistance. Further studies will be 
required to elucidate the relative importance 
of OSA compared with obesity in 
this disorder, the extent to which treatment 
of OSA affects the metabolic disturbances, 
and the mechanisms by 
which these metabolic perturbations 
have occurred. 

A correlation has been shown between 
higher fasting insulin levels in 
childhood and subsequent hypertriglyceridemia 
in adulthood.9 Clustering of 
cardiovascular risk variables for the 
metabolic syndrome was also found in 
children and young adults in the Bogalusa 
Heart Study.4 Of the risk factors 
for cardiovascular disease (insulin resistance, 
high BMI, dyslipidemia, and 
high blood pressure [>75th percentile]), 
insulin resistance and BMI demonstrated 
the strongest correlations.37 
Evidence supporting RDI as an independent 
risk factor for insulin resistance 
is found in another Australian 
study of obese, type 2 diabetic adult patients. 
In that group of patients, the use 
of continuous positive airway pressure 
improved sleep apnea and significantly 
improved insulin resistance, as measured 
by hypinsulinemic euglycemic 
clamp, in the absence of significant 
changes in BMI.35 

Obesity is not a commonly cited risk 
factor for children coming to a sleep-
unit. In a study of obese children, 
examining for type 2 diabetes, Pinhas-
Hamiel and Zeitler26 found an incidence 
of OSA of 6%. Of our initial population, 
40% were recommended for treatment. 
This number is greater than that anticipated 
from epidemiologic studies of 
other pediatric populations27-29 and one 
previous study of morbidly obese children 
with a history of sleep breathing 
abnormalities.30 In this limited study, we 
were not able to confirm the findings of 
Silvestri et al,31 who suggest that clinical 
screening increases the likelihood of 
predicting OSA in obese children. 

We thank the parents and children for their particpation
