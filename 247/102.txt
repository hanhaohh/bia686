ABSTRACT. Objective. Inattention and hyperactivity 
are frequent among children with sleep-disordered 
breathing (SDB) and often improve when SDB is treated. 
However, the frequency of SDB symptoms among inattentive 
and hyperactive children has received little study. 

Design. Cross-sectional survey. 

Setting. Two university-affiliated but community-
based general pediatrics clinics. 

Patients. Patients consisted of N . 
866 children (469 
boys), aged 2.0 to 13.9 years (mean: 6.8 . 
3.2 years), with 
clinic appointments. 

Measures. A validated Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire 
assessed for habitual snoring (1 item), snoring severity (a 
4-item subscale), sleepiness (4 items), and overall risk of 
SDB (16 items). Parents also completed 2 common behavioral 
measures, an inattention/hyperactivity scale (IHS) 
derived from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, and the hyperactivity 
index (HI, expressed as a t score) of the Conners’ Parent 
Rating Scale. 

Results. Habitual snoring was reported in 16% (95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 13, 19) of the participants. High 
HI scores (>60) were found in 13% (95% CI: 11, 16) of all 
participants, 22% (95% CI: 15, 29) of habitual snorers, and 
12% (95% CI: 9, 14) of nonsnorers. Odds ratios between 
HI >60 and each of the following were: habitual snoring, 

2.2 (95% CI: 1.4, 3.6); 1 additional positive symptom-item 
on the snoring scale, 1.3 (95% CI: 1.1, 1.5); 1 additional 
positive item on the sleepiness scale, 1.6 (95% CI: 1.4, 2.0); 
and a 1-standard deviation increase in the overall SDB 
score, 1.7 (95% CI: 1.4, 2.0; all odds ratios age-and sex-
adjusted). Results were similar for high IHS scores 
(>1.25). Stratification by age and sex showed that most of 
the association with snoring (but not sleepiness) derived 
from boys <8 years old. 
Conclusions. Inattention and hyperactivity among 
general pediatric patients are associated with increased 
daytime sleepiness and—especially in young boys— 
snoring and other symptoms of SDB. If sleepiness and 
SDB do influence daytime behavior, the current results 
suggest a major public health impact. Pediatrics 2002;109:

nattentive and hyperactive behavior are highly 
prevalent among school-aged children and are 
often associated with a clinical psychiatric syndrome 
such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder 
(ADHD).1 In many instances, unrecognized medical 
conditions underlie the problematic behavior.2 
One such medical condition may be obstructive 
sleep-disordered breathing (SDB).3 Clinical series 
from sleep disorders centers report that inattentive 
and hyperactive behavior are common among children 
with obstructive sleep apnea or upper airway 
resistance syndrome4,5 and that treatment of either 
form of SDB is often associated with improved behavior 
and decreased need for stimulant medication.
5,6 

Obstructive sleep apnea is estimated to affect between 
1% and 3% of school-aged children.7,8 The 
prevalence of upper airway resistance syndrome remains 
unknown, but may also be high.9 Between 7% 
and 12% of children snore habitually and have a 
particularly high risk for SDB.10 The high frequency 
of pediatric SDB, the possibility that most children 
(like adults11) remain undiagnosed, and evidence 
that SDB can influence daytime behavior all combine 
to suggest that occult SDB may have an important 
impact among children with inattentive and hyperactive 
behavior. 

However, the frequency of SDB among inattentive 
and hyperactive children has received little study. 
Researchers found high frequencies of snoring 
among 14 children with ADHD,12 among 31 children 
with ADHD or academic problems,13 and among 27 
ADHD patients at a child psychiatry clinic,14 but not 
in a fourth sample of 21 ADHD children.15 These 
studies were limited by small sample sizes, lack of 
validation for survey instruments, low subject participation 
rates, and variable definitions of snoring 
and ADHD. The sample sizes did not allow stratification—
based on age, sex, or other variables—that 
could yield clues to why sleep and behavior might be 
linked. Published polysomnographic studies of hyperactive 
children involved even smaller samples,

To further assess whether symptoms of SDB are 
particularly frequent among children with inattentive 
and hyperactive behavior, we administered a 
previously validated instrument, the Pediatric Sleep 
Questionnaire (PSQ),21 to a large sample of parents 
who brought their children to either of 2 general 
pediatric clinics. Parents also completed 2 validated 
measures of inattention and hyperactivity. We then 
compared the frequency of SDB symptoms among 
hyperactive and nonhyperactive children. 

METHODS 

Participants 

Recruitment procedures for this cohort have been described 
previously.22 Briefly, parents who brought their children to 2 
general pediatrics clinics were asked to sign an institutional review 
board-approved informed consent for a study on “the sleep 
and daytime behavior of children.” Study hypotheses were not 
described in more detail, in part to avoid influencing survey 
responses. Children 9 years old or able to understand the study 
were asked to sign an informed assent. Inclusion criteria were as 
follows: 1) age between 2.00 and 13.99 years, 2) parental ability to 
read and write, and 3) absence of mental or physical impairment 
severe enough to preclude interpretation of behavioral information 
collected. Participants were recruited between February 6, 
1998, and May 1, 2000, by research assistants who attempted to 
approach all child-parent pairs at the clinics on designated days. 
Both clinics are owned by the same large public university health 
system, which only recently acquired one of the practices and now 
employs 9 pediatricians at the 2 sites. The clinic population at both 
sites is primarily community-based. Parents generally took between 
20 and 30 minutes to complete the questionnaires. Data for 
each child were included in this report if at least two thirds of the 
items in the PSQ and each behavioral measure had been completed. 


Measures 

Parents, with encouragement to ask their children for help, 
completed the PSQ in waiting rooms. This instrument contains 
about 70 closed-question items with response options of “yes,” 
“no,” or “don’t know.” Instructions focused responses on behavior 
in general rather than recent days, during which the child may 
have been acutely ill. A 22-item SDB scale within the PSQ serves 
with adequate validity and reliability as a screen for polysomnographically 
defined obstructive sleep apnea and upper airway 
resistance syndrome.21 The SDB score is calculated as the proportion 
of symptoms that are present. Among 27 sleep laboratory-
referred children confirmed to have SDB and 54 children at a 
general pediatrics clinic, the SDB scale showed a sensitivity of 0.81 
and a specificity of 0.87. Subscales for snoring (Appendix 1, items 
A2, A3, A4, and A5), excessive daytime sleepiness (items B1, B2, 
B4, and B6), and daytime behavior (6 Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition [DSM-IV]-derived category 
A symptoms of ADHD) each discriminated effectively between 
the children with and without SDB.21 In the current study, 
the 22-item SDB scale was used without the 6 behavioral items to 
avoid artificial associations with hyperactive behavior. The shortened 
SDB scale appears in Appendix 1. Item A2, which asks about 
habitual snoring (defined as snoring more than half the time while 
asleep), also was analyzed separately, and snoring frequency was 
categorized according to parental indication that snoring occurred 
never, ever, more than half the time, or always. 

Parents completed 2 measures of inattention and hyperactivity. 
The inattention/hyperactivity scale (IHS) asks parents to rate the 
extent to which the 18 DSM-IV category A symptoms of ADHD 
(Appendix 2) apply to their children. Assessment of behavior by 
this method has a long history and the validity of the instrument 
has been well-established.23–25 The IHS has been used in previous 
studies of associations between childhood symptoms of SDB and 

inattentive and hyperactive behavior.14 Responses are provided 
on a 4-point Likert scale from 0 to 3. In the current study, a mean 
item response (IHS score) greater than 1.25 was considered high. 
This threshold is somewhat arbitrary but corresponds to 12 or 
more positive responses (“2, applies quite a bit” or “3, definitely 
applies most of the time”) among the 18 symptom-items. In the 
DSM-IV, 6 chronic symptoms among 9 that relate to inattention, 
plus 6 among 9 that relate to hyperactive/impulsive behavior, are 
required to support a diagnosis of ADHD, combined type.26 

The short form of the Conners’ Parent Rating Scale is a well-
validated, 48-item instrument that can help to identify behavioral 
problems in children.27 The instrument contains a Hyperactivity 
Index (HI), composed of the 10 most relevant items, that is one of 
the most widely used measures of the behavior. Symptoms are 
rated by parents on a 4-point scale, and raw scores are converted 
to age-and sex-adjusted t scores. These t scores range from 0 to 
100 and average 50; scores that exceed this average by 1 standard 
deviation (10 points) to 2 standard deviations (20 points) are 
commonly considered to represent hyperactive behavior. In this 
study, HI 60 was considered to reflect hyperactive behavior. 

Analysis 

Data were summarized with means and standard deviations or 
by percentages and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Logistic regression 
models of IHS 1.25 or HI 60 were used to test for associations 
with habitual snoring, snoring subscale scores, sleepiness 
subscale scores, and overall SDB scores. All odds ratios and their 
95% CIs were adjusted for age and sex. To examine interaction of 
sleep-related symptoms with age and sex, the sample was stratified 
and analyses repeated. Covariance between IHS and HI was 
tested with the Spearman rank correlation coefficient . Attributable 
risk percent and population attributable risk percent were 
calculated according to standard procedures28 and contingent on 
2 assumptions: that habitual snoring (or any associated SDB) can 
cause hyperactivity (HI 60), and that the pediatric clinic population 
prevalence of habitual snoring was that measured in the 
current study. The attributable risk percent and the population 
attributable risk percent then estimate, respectively, the proportion 
of snoring, hyperactive children, and the proportion of all 
hyperactive children whose behavioral problem could be eliminated 
by treatment of snoring or any associated SDB. Analyses 
were performed with SAS, version 6.12 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, 
NC). The level of significance was set at P . 
.05. 

RESULTS 

Participants 

Parents of approximately 1400 children were approached, 
and data from 866 children were included 
in these analyses. Among excluded children, parents 
of 349 failed to finish a sleep or behavior questionnaire, 
and the remainder refused to participate. The 
mean participant age was 6.8 . 
3.2 years, 469 (54%) 
of the participants were boys, and 397 (46%) were 
girls. These and other descriptive summaries of the 
sample are shown in Table 1. Hyperactive behavior 
was identified in similar proportions of the clinic 
sample by both the IHS and the HI. The correlation 
between these 2 scores (. 
. 
0.74; P . 
.0001) suggested 
considerable but not perfect overlap between 
the measures. 

Snoring, Sleepiness, SDB, and Associations With 
Behavior 

Habitual snoring showed a trend toward an association 
with IHS 1.25 and a significant association 
with HI 60 (Table 2). Among habitual snorers, 22% 
(95% CI: 15, 29) had HI 60, whereas among nonhabitual 
snorers, only 12% (95% CI: 9, 14) had HI 60. 
The snoring, sleepiness, and SDB scores each showed 
significant associations with the 2 outcomes. The 
strength of these associations was not small. For

comparison, the unadjusted odds ratio for the long-
recognized association1 between male sex and hyperactive 
behavior—as reflected by IHS 1.25—was 2.7 
(95% CI: 1.7, 4.3; adjustment for habitual snoring did 
not change this odds ratio substantially). A trend 
toward a dose-response relationship between reported 
snoring frequency and behavior is shown 
graphically in Fig 1. The attributable risk percent for 
habitual snoring and HI 60 was 53%, and the population 
attributable risk percent was 15%. 

Associations Between Snoring and Sleepiness 

Snoring scores correlated with sleepiness scores 
(. 
. 
0.19; P . 
.0001). After accounting for sleepiness 
scores, the snoring scores showed somewhat less 
robust associations with behavioral measures. The 
odds ratio for HI 60 and habitual snoring was 
reduced from 2.2 (95% CI: 1.4, 3.6) to 1.8 (95% CI: 1.1, 
3.0), and the odds ratio for HI and snoring score was 
reduced from 1.3 (95% CI: 1.1, 1.5) to 1.2 (95% CI: 1.0, 
1.4). Conversely, after accounting for snoring scores, 
sleepiness scores showed essentially no reduction in 
association with behavioral measures. 

Stratification by Age and Sex 

Among the 469 boys in the sample, IHS and HI 
each showed significant associations with habitual 
snoring, snoring scores, sleepiness scores, and SDB 
scores. Among habitually snoring boys, 28% (95% CI: 
17, 38) had HI 60, whereas among nonhabitually 
snoring boys, 12% (95% CI: 9, 16) had HI 60. 

Among the 397 girls, only 2 of the 4 explanatory 
variables—sleepiness scores and SDB scores— 
showed associations with behavioral measures. Results 
for HI are shown in Table 3. Logistic regression 
models showed that the interactions of sex with each 
of the 4 symptom variables failed to reach statistical 
significance. 

Division of the sample into 6 subcategories based 
on age generally showed similar findings for the 
youngest 3 groups and similar findings for the oldest 

3. Data, therefore, are reported here for children 
younger than 8 years in comparison with those 8 or 
more years old. Among the 565 younger children in 
the sample, IHS and HI each showed significant 
associations with habitual snoring, snoring score, 
sleepiness score, and SDB score. Among habitually 
snoring children 8 years old, 22% (95% CI: 14, 31) 
had HI 60, whereas among nonhabitually snoring 
children in this age group, only 9% (6, 12) had HI 
60. Among the 301 children who were 8 or more 
years old, only 2 of the 4 explanatory variables— 
again sleepiness score and SDB score—showed associations 
with behavioral measures. Regression results 
for HI are shown in Table 4. Interaction models 
showed statistically significant effects of younger 
versus older age on the associations between behavior 
measures and habitual snoring (IHS only), snoring 
score, and SDB score, but not on the association 
between behavior measures and sleepiness scores 
(P . 
.10). 
As suggested by the results for male children and

those for younger children, the subgroup of 295 boys 

8 years old showed substantially stronger associations 
between snoring measures and behavior than 
did the remaining 571 children (Table 5). The HI was 
associated with snoring frequency among young 
boys (Fig 2A) but not among young girls (Fig 2B), 
older boys (Fig 2C), or older girls (Fig 2D). Among 
habitually snoring young boys, 30% (95% CI: 17, 43) 
had HI 60, whereas among nonhabitually snoring 
young boys, only 9% (95% CI: 5, 13) had HI 60. 
Among all the young boys in this study, the attributable 
risk percent for habitual snoring and HI 60 
was 77%, and the population attributable risk percent 
was 39%. 
Among young boys, adjustment for sleepiness 
somewhat reduced the association between snoring 
and behavioral measures. For example, the odds ratio 
for HI 60 and habitual snoring was reduced 
from 4.3 (95% CI: 2.0, 9.1) to 3.5 (95% CI: 1.6, 7.6), and 

the odds ratio for HI 60 and snoring score was 
reduced from 1.8 (95% CI: 1.4, 2.3) to 1.6 (95% CI: 1.3, 
2.1). Conversely, adjustment for snoring also somewhat 
reduced the association between sleepiness and 
behavioral measures. For example, adjustment for 
habitual snoring reduced the odds ratio for HI 60 
and sleepiness from 1.8 (95% CI: 1.3, 2.5) to 1.7 (95% 

CI: 1.2, 2.4), and adjustment for snoring score reduced 
it to 1.5 (95% CI: 1.1, 2.1). 
DISCUSSION 

This cross-sectional study of children at 2 general 
pediatrics clinics shows substantial associations between 
several SDB symptoms and measures of inattention 
and hyperactivity. Inattentive and hyperactive 
children were reported to have more frequent 
snoring, more severe daytime sleepiness, and higher 
scores on an overall scale that identifies SDB with 
reasonable validity and reliability. The link between 
snoring measures and behavior resulted from a particularly 
strong association among young boys, and 
could not be demonstrated in children outside this 
group. In contrast, sleepiness and overall SDB scores 
showed similar associations with behavior among 
young boys and other age-and sex-defined groups. 
Although a correlative study design does not permit 
conclusions about causality, the current results suggest 
that SDB and daytime sleepiness may be important 
considerations in a large number children who 
exhibit inattentive and hyperactive behavior. 

This study is distinguished from previous research 
on sleep in hyperactive children by its large sample 
size and by use of validated instruments to assess 
both explanatory and outcome variables. The current 
findings support previous suggestions that SDB is 
more common in hyperactive children,12–14 and suggest 
that failure to reach the same conclusions in the 
past may have been attributable to methodological 
limitations.15 The current study also allowed specification 
of the strength of the association, within relatively 
narrow CIs. Habitual snoring increased the 
chance of hyperactivity—as reflected by scores commonly 
considered abnormal on the Conners’ Parent 
Rating Scale HI—from 12% to 22% among all the 
children (odds ratio: 2.2), and from 9% to 30% among 
young boys (odds ratio: 4.3). 

Our study also showed that excessive daytime 
sleepiness is linked to inattention and hyperactivity.

This finding is consistent with data from sleep-disordered 
(and often sleepy) children referred to sleep 
clinics,4,5,29–33 neurophysiological evidence of hypoarousal 
in ADHD,34 and improvement in behavior 
and hypoarousal among ADHD children treated 
with stimulants.35,36 Our finding that adjustment for 
snoring did not greatly diminish the association between 
sleepiness and ADHD-like behavior is consistent 
with the fact that in many children, sleepiness is 
not a result of SDB. The most common cause of 
daytime sleepiness in school-aged children is insufficient 
sleep.37 The desire of working parents to 
spend evenings with their children and still bring 
them to day care or school early in the morning may 
infringe on sleep time. Homework, computer games, 
television, sports, lessons, social commitments, and 
after-school jobs may all conspire to leave little time 
for sleep. An underlying tendency to have a delayed 
sleep phase, especially as adolescence approaches, 
may combine with early school start times to produce 
excessive sleepiness in many youngsters. 

This study explored, for the first time, the influence 
of age and sex on associations between behavior 
and sleep-related symptoms. Sleepiness seems to be 
linked to hyperactive behavior in both boys and girls 
and throughout childhood and early adolescence. In 
contrast, the association between snoring and behavior 
seems to be stronger among younger children 
than among older children. Snoring might be predicted 
to be more common among children younger 
than 8 years—tonsils and adenoids are largest relative 
to upper airway size between ages 3 and 638— 
but in our cohort, snoring frequency did not vary 
significantly between 6 different age groups.39 Snor


ing and obstructive SDB may well be caused by 
anatomic and neurophysiological factors that differ 
between young children and adults.40 Upper airways 
of older children may resemble those of adults more 
closely than those of young children. If so, habitual 
snoring may reveal different information depending 
on a child’s age. Another possibility is that snoring or 
related SDB may have different consequences in 
younger and older children because of age-specific 
central nervous system vulnerabilities or sleep architecture.
41 

Snoring also differed from sleepiness in that it 
showed significant associations with behavior only 
among boys (although the difference between sexes 
did not reach statistical significance). Obstructive 
SDB is believed to occur in approximately equal 
proportions of boys and girls,42 and snoring did not 
differ significantly with sex in our cohort.39 However, 
ADHD is several times more common among 
boys than girls,43 which raises the possibility of a 
sex-based vulnerability to any influence that SDB 
may have on behavior. 

Several limitations of the current study must be 
considered in the interpretation of results. The PSQ 
SDB scale has good ability to predict sleep laboratory-
confirmed SDB and is much easier to administer 
in large samples, but it cannot replace full polysomnography. 
Our results may have been subject to biases 
inherent to surveys. For example, parental rating 
levels for sleep and behavioral symptoms both 
may have been influenced in the same direction by 
parent-specific variables. Many potential third variables 
remained uncontrolled in this study, which 
used broad inclusion criteria, in an effort to maxi-

sleep disruption, sleep deprivation, inadequate oxygen 
saturation, and many other physiologic changes 
associated with SDB could play important roles. The 
association we identified between behavior and 
snoring was somewhat reduced after taking sleepiness 
into account: this suggests that sleepiness could 
act, to some extent, as an intermediary variable. Children 
who are sleepy may be more likely to shift their 
attention frequently and create stimulation to keep 
themselves awake, especially at young ages when 
wakefulness is essential to rapid learning.15,32,44 

In adults, SDB is associated with significant cognitive 
changes and excessive sleepiness which show 
some correlation with levels of both sleep disruption 
and oxygen desaturation.45,46 In children, experimental 
sleep deprivation impairs cognitive function,
47,48 and elementary school children with SDB 
achieve low grades that improve when the SDB is 
treated.49 Cognitive changes associated with untreated 
SDB may promote inattentive and hyperactive 
behavior. At sleep laboratories, little work has 
been done to determine which polysomnographic 
features and physiologic variables are most closely 
associated with hyperactive behavior. Recent data 
from 113 children referred to our laboratory for suspected 
SDB suggest that apnea and hypopnea rates 
and minimum oxygen saturation do not predict HI.50 
However, sleepiness was not measured directly and 
may not be reflected adequately by the other SDB 
measures.46 Data from adults show that sleep laboratory 
measures of SDB do not fully account for the 
association between snoring and sleepiness,51 which 
suggests that sleep laboratory measures in children 
also may fail to account for the association between 
snoring and daytime behavior. 

Alternatively, current findings could have resulted 
from the influence of an unstudied third variable. 
Our cross-sectional study did not determine whether 
hyperactivity or symptoms of SDB occurred first. 
The possibility that hyperactive behavior leads to 
some SDB symptoms cannot be excluded. Hyperactive 
children often have disturbed, restless sleep that 
potentially could explain increased daytime sleepiness.
52–55 However, no ready explanation has been 
proposed for how hyperactivity or restless sleep 
might increase snoring. Clinical series and one quasi-
experimental study of children treated for SDB (by 
tonsillectomy) or for other surgical problems suggested 
that treatment for SDB improves inattention 
and hyperactivity.5,6 Additional controlled trials and 
polysomnographic studies will be needed to clarify 
whether SDB does actually contribute to inattention 
and hyperactivity. 

If habitual snoring or any underlying SDB is a 
cause of hyperactive behavior in some children, the 
population attributable risk percent suggests that a 
substantial percentage of children with HI 60 (15%) 
could be effectively treated by identification and 
treatment of habitual snoring and any underlying 
SDB. Among hyperactive young boys, this figure 
rises to 39%. In a previous smaller study that compared 
ADHD patients at a child psychiatry clinic to 
non-ADHD patients at a general pediatrics clinic, we 
estimated the population attributable risk percent for 

habitual snoring to be 25%.14 These estimates can be 
misleading in case-control studies, but are more reliable 
to the extent that the sample is population-
based. The current estimates, derived from a large 
sample in 2 predominantly community-based pediatric 
practices, suggest that SDB could constitute a 
substantial public health burden.
