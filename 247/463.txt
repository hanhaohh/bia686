ABSTRACT 


OBJECTIVE. 
The 
link 
between 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
and 
neurocognitive 
functioning 
in 
preschool 
and 
school-aged 
children 
now 
has 
been 
established 
clearly. 
Within 
these 
age 
groups, 
isolated 
studies 
have 
examined 
the 
potential 
effect 
of 
snoring 
without 
gas 
exchange 
abnormalities 
on 
aspects 
of 
cognitive 
competence. 
The 
goal 
of 
the 
study 
was 
to 
test 
the 
potential 
association 
between 
snoring 
and 
decrements 
in 
developmental 
performance 
among 
infants. 


METHODS. 
Thirty-five 
healthy 
community 
infants 
(8.2 
. 
0.4 
months) 
were 
administered 
the 
Bayley 
Scales 
of 
Infant 
Development, 
including 
the 
Mental 
Development 
Index 
(MDI), 
after 
standard, 
overnight 
research 
polysomnography. 


RESULTS. 
The 
apnea-hypopnea 
index 
for 
all 
infants 
was 
0. 
Respiratory 
arousal 
index 
was 
significantly 
correlated 
with 
MDI. 
Snoring-associated 
arousals 
accounted 
exclusively 
for 
this 
relationship; 
spontaneous 
arousals 
and 
those 
that 
were 
associated 
with 
central 
apnea 
and 
oxyhemoglobin 
desaturation 
episodes 
(4%) 
were 
not 
significantly 
correlated 
with 
MDI. 
Living 
in 
a 
smoking 
household 
was 
not 
significantly 
associated 
with 
the 
presence 
of 
objectively 
recorded 
snoring 
but 
was 
associated 
with 
an 
increase 
in 
arousal 
frequency 
in 
snoring 
infants. 


CONCLUSIONS. 
Infants 
with 
lower 
scores 
on 
a 
standardized 
mental 
development 
assessment 
had 
higher 
snoring-arousal 
indices. 
Because 
neither 
apnea 
nor 
hypopnea 
was 
present, 
these 
findings 
constitute 
additional 
evidence 
that 
snoring 
is 
not 
just 
an 
innocent 
noise 
during 
sleep 
in 
infants 
but 
may 
in 
fact 
represent 
the 
lower 
end 
of 
the 
disease 
spectrum 
associated 
with 
sleep-disordered 
breathing. 
Secondhand 
exposure 
to 
cigarette 
smoke 
may 
increase 
the 
deleterious 
effects 
of 
infant 
snoring.

HERE 
IS 
NOW 
substantial 
and 
compelling 
evidence 
indicating 
that 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
(SDB) 
during 
early 
childhood 
is 
deleterious 
to 
cognition. 
Furthermore, 
SDB 
in 
early 
childhood 
leads 
to 
greater 
utilization 
of 
health 
care 
resources,1 
more 
frequent 
dose-
dependent 
cardiovascular 
morbidity2,3 
and 
comorbid 
chronic 
illnesses,4,5 
as 
well 
as 
greater 
psychiatric 
and 
behavioral 
comorbidities.6–10 
Impairments 
associated 
with 
SDB 
have 
been 
shown 
on 
cognition 
and 
school 
performance.6,9,11–16 
The 
cumulative 
evidence 
points 
to 
at 
least 
partial 
reversibility 
of 
many 
of 
these 
effects 
in 
chil


dren17–20 


and 
in 
animal 
models,21,22 
highlighting 
the 
importance 
of 
early 
detection 
of 
pediatric 
SDB. 
Indeed, 
failure 
to 
thrive 
associated 
with 
SDB, 
which 
has 
been 
reported 
in 
up 
to 
52% 
of 
patient 
samples, 
has 
been 
shown 
to 
be 
reversible 
in 
infants 
who 
are 
younger 
than 
18 
months 
after 
treatment.23 


Although 
report 
of 
snoring 
history 
is 
insufficient 
for 
diagnosis 
of 
SDB, 
it 
is 
known 
that 
snoring 
is 
reliably 
present 
in 
children 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
(OSA).24 
The 
prevalence 
of 
SDB 
among 
school-aged 
children 
is 
estimated 
at 
2% 
to 
3%,25,26 
and 
symptoms 
that 
are 
consistent 
with 
risk 
for 
SDB 
have 
been 
reported 
between 
6% 
and 
27%.4,12,15,26 
An 
emerging 
body 
of 
work 
recently 
addressed 
the 
cognitive 
effects 
of 
mild 
SDB, 
or 
snoring 
exclusive 
of 
OSA, 
among 
school-aged 
children. 
Primary 
or 
habitual 
snoring 
may 
cause 
sufficient 
disruption 
of 
sleep 
architecture 
such 
that 
daytime 
functioning 
is 
affected 
in 
children.27 
Children 
who 
are 
aged 
8 
to 
11 
years 
and 
have 
apnea-hypopnea 
indices 
(AHI) 
of 
1 
and 
10 
have 
impaired 
executive 
function.28 
Compared 
with 
nonsnoring 
control 
subjects, 
5-to 
8-year-olds 
who 
snore 
but 
have 
an 
obstructive 
AHI 
of 
1 
per 
hour 
of 
total 
sleep 
time 
(TST) 
have 
impaired 
verbal 
and 
global 
IQ 
and 
selective 
and 
sustained 
attention 
and 
memory, 
with 
direct 
relationships 
between 
severity 
of 
impairment 
and 
mild 
oxyhemoglobin 
desaturations, 
obstructive 
hypopneas 
with 
desaturation, 
and 
respiratory 
arousals.29 
Habitual 
snoring 
among 
children 
who 
are 
aged 
5 
to 
7 
and 
have 
an 
obstructive 
AHI 
of 
1 
per 
hour 
of 
TST 
have 
impaired 
performance 
on 
attention 
measures, 
as 
well 
as 
greater 
social 
problems 
and 
anxious/depressive 
symptoms.16 


Prevalence 
rates 
of 
snoring 
similar 
to 
those 
of 
preschool-
and 
early 
school-aged 
children 
have 
been 
reported 
among 
infants. 
Indeed, 
habitual 
snoring 
was 
found 
in 
5% 
of 
2-to 
4-month-olds30 
and 
in 
6-to 
12month-
olds,26 
with 
higher 
rates 
in 
infants 
who 
are 
aged 
1 
to 
8 
months 
(16 
–26%).31 
More 
recently, 
we 
found 
habitual 
snoring 
in 
1% 
to 
9% 
of 
infants 
and 
toddlers 
(2–24 
months 
of 
age).32 
However, 
the 
influence 
of 
snoring 
on 
the 
developing 
infant 
is 
unknown. 
Accordingly, 
the 
primary 
goal 
of 
the 
present 
study 
was 
to 
test 
the 
association 
between 
snoring 
and 
cognitive 
development 
among 
8-month-old 
infants. 


Furthermore, 
exposure 
to 
secondhand 
smoke 
is 
a 
known 
risk 
factor 
for 
snoring 
and 
SDB 
among 
school-

aged 
children,33 
and 
significant 
differences 
have 
been 
shown 
in 
the 
histopathologic 
and 
ultrastructural 
evaluation 
of 
adenoid 
tissue 
from 
children 
who 
were 
exposed 
to 
passive 
smoking, 
indicating 
that 
this 
exposure 
is 
a 
primary 
contributor 
to 
repeated 
upper 
respiratory 
tract 
infection.34 
Passive 
smoking 
also 
was 
identified 
previously 
as 
a 
risk 
factor 
for 
snoring 
among 
infants.31,35 
Thus, 
a 
secondary 
study 
goal 
was 
to 
determine 
whether 
presence 
of 
smoking 
in 
the 
household 
had 
a 
contributing 
effect 
on 
snoring 
and 
arousal 
indices. 


METHODS 


The 
study 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
institutional 
review 
boards 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Louisville, 
Clark 
Memorial 
Hospital, 
Baptist

were 
included 
in 
the 
postpartum 
discharge 
packets 
at 
6 
local 
hospitals. 
Screening 
surveys 
then 
were 
sent 
to 
the 
homes 
of 
respondents 
when 
their 
infants 
reached 
6 
months 
and 
were 
returned 
to 
the 
research 
office 
via 
postage-paid 
mail. 
Qualifying 
families 
were 
invited 
to 
participate 
further 
when 
the 
infant 
reached 
8 
months. 


Survey 
Instrument 


The 
instrument 
assessed 
parent 
and 
child 
demographics, 
and 
a 
health 
history 
section 
included 
whether 
each 
parent 
snores 
or 
smokes 
(yes/no 
responses). 
Child 
sleep 
behaviors 
were 
assessed, 
including, 
“How 
often 
does 
your 
child 
snore?” 
with 
response 
options 
including 
“never” 
(never 
in 
the 
past 
6 
months), 
“rarely” 
(once 
a 
week), 
“occasionally” 
(2 
times 
a 
week), 
“frequently” 
(3–4 
times 
a 
week), 
and 
“almost 
always” 
(4 
times 
a 
week). 
These 
items 
were 
taken 
from 
a 
thoroughly 
validated 
and 
previously 
described 
instrument.36 


Polysomnography

Overnight 
polysomnography 
recordings 
were 
performed 
within 
the 
research 
unit 
of 
the 
Kosair 
Children’s 
Hospital 
Sleep 
Medicine 
and 
Apnea 
Center 
using 
commercially 
available 
computerized 
multichannel

that 
included 
4 
channels 
of 
electroencephalography 
(O1/O2, 
C3/C4), 
chin 
electromyography, 
bilateral 
electrooculogram, 
snore 
sound 
sensor, 
electrocardiogram, 
chest 
and 
abdominal 
inductance 
plethysmography; 
pulse 
oximetry 
was 
used 
to 
measure 
arterial 
oxygen

(SpO2) 
and 
pulse 
wave 
form 
and 
thermistor-

Stage 
scoring 
was 
performed 
using 
standard 
criteria 
for 
infants.37 
Time 
spent 
in 
active 
sleep, 
quiet 
sleep, 
and 
indeterminate 
sleep 
was 
calculated 
and 
expressed 
as 
a 
percentage 
of 
the 
TST. 
Respiratory 
events 
that 
lasted 
at 
least 
2 
breath-lengths 
were 
scored: 
central 
apneas 
were 
scored 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
cessation 
of 
oronasal 
flow 
and 
chest 
wall 
and 
abdominal 
movement; 
obstructive 
apnea 
was 
scored 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
oronasal 
airflow 
with 
continued 
chest 
wall 
and 
abdominal 
movement38,39; 
decreases 
in 
oronasal 
flow 
50% 
with 
continued 
effort 
were 
scored 
as 
hypopneas. 
Minimal 
duration 
of 
2 
breath-lengths 
and 
an 
associated 
4% 
SpO2 
desaturation 
and/or 
arousal 
were 
required 
for 
obstructive 
apnea 
and 
hypopnea 
scoring. 
Snoring 
was 
scored 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
a 
change 
in 
basal 
snore 
sensor 
levels 
that 
was 
verified 
by 
the 
polysomnographic 
technologist 
via 
both 
in-room 
checks 
and 
microphone 
transmission. 
Cardiorespiratory 
variables 
were 
scored 
as 
indices 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
number 
of 
events 
per 
hour 
of 
TST. 
Average 
SpO2 
and 
nocturnal 
nadir 
were 
calculated 
from 
valid 
SpO2 
during 
TST 
with 
values 
during 
movement 
artifact 
being 
excluded. 


Because 
criteria 
for 
arousals 
have 
not 
yet 
been 
established 
for 
infants 
and 
children, 
arousals 
were 
scored 
manually 
as 
defined 
by 
the 
American 
Sleep 
Disorders 
Association 
Task 
Force 
report; 
briefly, 
an 
abrupt 
change 
in 
electroencephalography 
that 
lasted 
3 
to 
14 
seconds 
with 
a 
concurrent 
change 
in 
electromyography 
in 
rapid 
eye 
movement 
sleep40 
was 
scored 
as 
spontaneous 
or 
respiratory 
related 
(occurring 
immediately 
subsequent 
to 
an 
apnea, 
hypopnea, 
desaturation, 
or 
snore). 
Arousals 
and 
respiratory 
events 
were 
scored 
as 
indices 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
occurrence 
per 
hour 
of 
TST. 
Scoring 
of 
respiratory 
events 
and 
desaturations 
was 
initially 
automated, 
all 
events 
and 
signals 
then 
were 
individually 
scorer 
validated. 
Polysomnography 
records 
were

The 
Bayley

(BSID-II) 
were 
performed 
the 
morning 
after 
polysomnography 
by 
a 
blinded 
administrator; 
parents 
were 
asked 
not 
to 
discuss 
the 
polysomnography 
with 
the 
administrator. 
The 
BSID 
was 
originally 
standardized 
in 
the 
United

under 
the 
auspices 
of 
the 
National

Statistical 
Analyses 


Descriptive

were 
calculated. 
Regression 
analyses 
were 
conducted 
for 
continuous 
variables.

was 
used 
to

5. 
One-way 
analysis 
of

was 
used 
for

was 
calculated 
to 
determine

sizes. 
Data 
were 
analyzed 
using 
SPSS

RESULTS 


Forty-four 
infants 
were 
recruited 
into 
the 
study, 
with 
9 
lost 
as 
a 
result 
of 
intolerance 
of

Thirty-five 
infants 
underwent 
full 
overnight 
polysomnography 
recordings 
and 
developmental 
assessment 
and 
were 
available 
for 
analysis 
(Table

Four 
pregnancies 
were 
complicated 
by 
gestational 
diabetes, 
pregnancy-induced 
hypertension,

1 
infant 
received 
a 
diagnosis 
of 
glycogen

disease 
type

after 
participation. 
Ten 
infants 
had 
medication 
administered 
within 
24 
hours 
before 
polysomnography: 
acetaminophen 
(n 
3), 
ophthalmic

(n

decongestant 
and 
antihistamine 
(n

metoclopramide 
(n

ibuprofen 
(n

and 
topical 
hydrocortisone 
(n 
1). 
Glycogen 
storage 
disease 
type 
IX 
can 
cause 
developmental 
delay, 
but 
this 
infant’s 
MDI 
was 
average 
(96) 
and 
the 
data 
were 
retained. 


Infants 
spent 
5.8 
to 
10.7 
hours 
asleep 
with 
an 
average 
of 
1.1 
hour 
awake 
after 
initial 
sleep 
onset. 
The 
average 
total 
arousal 
index 
was 
8.9 
per 
hour 
of 
TST, 
and 
respiratory 
arousal 
index 
(RespArI) 
was 
0.67 
per 
hour 
of 
TST. 
No 
infant 
had 
any 
obstructive 
apneas 
or 
hypopneas; 
all 
but 
9 
infants 
had 
central 
apneas, 
with 
indices 
ranging 
from 
0.12 
to 
4.02. 
Central 
apneas 
were 
not 
associated 
with 
significant 
desaturations 
(Table 
2). 


There 
was 
a 
significant, 
negative 
correlation 
between 
MDI 
and 
RespArI 
(r 
.43; 
F 
7.3; 
P 
.011; 
Fig 
1). 
Because 
there 
were 
no 
obstructive 
apneas 
or 
hypopneas, 
RespArI 
was 
made 
up 
of 
arousals 
that 
resulted 
from 
central 
apneas, 
oxyhemoglobin 
desaturation 
(SpO2 


4%) 
episodes, 
and 
snoring. 
Among 
these, 
snoring-
related 
arousals 
accounted 
exclusively 
for 
the 
correlation 
between 
MDI 
and 
RespArI 
(r 
.43; 
F 
7.3; 
P 
. 
.011). 
Spontaneous 
arousals 
and 
those 
that 
were 
associated 
with 
central 
apneas 
and 
desaturations 
were 
not 
significantly 
correlated 
with 
MDI. 
Variance 
among 
maternal 
education 
years 
was 
low; 
MDI 
and 
maternal 
education 
were 
not 
significantly 
correlated. 
Motor 
Scale 
scores 
on 
the 
BSID 
were 
not 
significantly 
associated 
with 
polysomnography 
measures. 
Fifty-nine 
percent 
of 
infants 
had 
at 
least 
1 
parent 
who 
reported 
snoring. 
2 
values 
were 
nonsignificant 
for 
a 
relationship 
between 
parental 
snoring 
and 
the 
presence 
of 
either 
infant 
snoring 
or 
respiratory-related 
arousals 
on

Infants

also 
both 
significantly

differ 
significantly 
between 
infants 
from

(F 
2.0;

There 
were 
no 
significant

as

of 
TST 
or 
sleep 
efficiency 
on 
RespArI

MDI. 


DISCUSSION 


The 
data 
presented 
herein 
indicate 
that 
even 
among 
infants 
and 
toddlers, 
the 
concept 
of 
habitual 
snoring’s 
being 
an 
innocent 
phenomenon 
without 
adverse 
consequences 
probably 
needs 
to 
be 
viewed 
as 
obsolete. 
Indeed, 
snoring 
may 
present 
a 
developmental 
hazard 
in 
young 
children, 
particularly 
when 
snore-associated 
arousals 
are 
present. 
Furthermore, 
we 
show 
that 
exposure 
to 
environmental 
smoke 
increases 
the 
risk 
for 
snoring-
related 
sleep 
fragmentation. 


In 
the 
present 
study, 
we 
did 
not 
find 
conclusive 
evidence 
suggesting 
that 
living 
in 
a 
cigarette-smoking 
household 
increased 
the 
risk 
for 
snoring 
per 
se. 
However, 
Mitchell 
and 
Thompson31 
found 
that 
among 
nearly 
2000 
infants 
from 
1 
to 
8 
months 
of 
age, 
parental 
report 
of 
snoring 
was 
increased 
with 
concurrent 
reporting 
of 
maternal 
cigarette 
smoking, 
along 
with 
the 
presence 
of

gender,

fections, 
and 
the 
presence 
of 
snoring 
during 
the 
first 
month 
after 
birth. 
These 
findings 
suggest 
that 
multiple 
modifiers 
may 
contribute 
to 
the 
occurrence 
of 
snoring 
in 
the 
first 
year 
of 
life. 


More 
important, 
we 
still 
do 
not 
know 
much 
about 
the 
natural 
history 
of 
snoring 
and 
snore-induced 
arousals 
in 
infancy. 
Zucconi 
et 
al46 
found 
that 
among 
18-to 
24month-
olds 
who 
were 
evaluated 
for 
nightly 
snoring 
and 
referred 
for 
surgical 
treatment, 
the 
parents 
of 
50% 
reported 
that 
the 
habitual 
snoring 
had 
developed 
during 
the 
child’s 
first 
year 
of 
life, 
and 
16% 
reported 
an 
onset 
in 
the 
first 
month 
of 
life. 
Furthermore, 
habitual 
snoring 
may 
persist 
over 
a 
1-year 
period 
in 
49% 
of 
primary 
school 
children. 
It 
is 
interesting 
that 
household 
cigarette 
smoking 
was 
identified 
as 
a 
risk 
factor 
for 
both 
initial 
onset 
of 
snoring 
and 
its 
continued 
presence 
over 
time.35 
Thus, 
we 
speculate 
that 
exposure 
to 
secondhand 
cigarette 
smoke 
not 
only 
may 
account 
for 
more 
snore-related 
arousals 
but 
may 
also 
contribute 
to 
the 
development 
of 
SDB 
among 
very 
young 
snorers. 


Some 
of 
the 
study 
limitations 
merit 
discussion. 
First, 
the 
survey 
response 
rate 
is 
unknown 
because 
of 
the 
implementation 
of 
a 
prohibition 
on 
tracking 
the 
number 
of 
nonparticipants 
subsequent 
to 
Health 
Insurance 
Portability 
and 
Accountability 
Act 
legislation. 
Response 
cards 
were 
distributed 
to 
postpartum 
patients 
through 
local 
hospitals 
at 
the 
discretion 
of 
the 
nursing 
and 
clerical 
staff, 
so 
a 
response 
percentage 
cannot 
be 
calculated; 
among 
those 
who 
returned 
the 
response 
card 
and 
were 
sent 
a 
survey, 
the 
response 
rate 
was 
57.1%. 
Thus, 
a 
self-selection 
bias 
clearly 
is 
possible, 
and 
our 
ability 
to 
generalize 
the 
results 
is 
limited. 
Second, 
the 
survey 
was 
not 
designed 
to 
gather 
extensive 
and 
comprehensive 
information 
about 
exposure 
to 
secondhand 
cigarette 
smoke. 
However, 
the 
previous 
studies 
reported 
above 
and 
current 
findings 
emphasize 
the 
need 
and 
the 
importance 
of 
future 
research 
into 
the 
mechanisms 
that 
influence 
snore-related 
arousals 
in 
infants 
and 
whether 
this 
effect 
is 
exposure 
dependent. 
Finally, 
1 
of 
the 
original 
goals 
of 
the 
study 
was 
to 
screen 
infants 
at 
the 
age 
of 
8 
months 
for 
objective 
evidence 
of 
SDB 
while 
minimizing 
intrusion 
into 
the 
natural 
sleep 
pattern 
and 
mother-
infant 
interactions 
during 
the 
recording 
period. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
home-based 
studies 
using 
currently 
available 
instrumentation 
for 
sleep 
recordings 
in 
infants 
are 
vulnerable 
to 
data 
losses, 
and 
preliminary 
trials 
using 
this 
approach 
confirmed 
such 
concerns. 
Thus, 
we 
used 
a 
sleep 
laboratory– 
based 
approach 
that 
enabled 
a 
high 
rate 
of 
data 
integrity 
with 
minimal 
intrusion 
to 
the 
infant 
and 
the 
parent. 
Although 
the 
percentage 
of 
wake 
time 
subsequent 
to 
sleep 
onset 
was 
higher 
than 
would 
be 
expected 
in 
a 
naturalistic 
setting, 
it 
should 
be 
emphasized 
that 
no 
relationships 
were 
found 
between 
RespArI 
or 
MDI 
and 
TST 
or 
sleep 
efficiency. 
Thus, 
we 
do 
not 
expect 
that 
administration 
of 
the 
BSID 
after 
polysom


nography 
had 
on 
influence 
on 
MDI 
scores 
as 
a 
function 
of 
sleep 
loss. 


This 
study 
and 
others 
clearly 
support 
the 
need 
for 
identification 
and 
evaluation 
of 
the 
youngest 
children 
with 
recognizable 
risk 
factors 
for 
SDB. 
This 
may 
pose 
a 
formidable 
challenge 
when 
we 
consider 
that 
the 
symptoms 
of 
SDB, 
such 
as 
snoring, 
are 
less 
frequently 
the 
presenting 
complaint 
in 
such 
children 
when 
compared 
with 
associated 
comorbidities, 
such 
as 
recurrent 
upper 
respiratory 
tract 
infections 
and 
delays 
in 
growth 
and 
development.47 
In 
addition, 
the 
recently 
published 
American 
Academy 
of 
Pediatrics 
2003 
guidelines 
for 
diagnosis 
and 
management 
of 
SDB 
in 
childhood 
specifically 
exclude 
children 
who 
are 
younger 
than 
1 
year 
because 
these 
cases 
are 
considered 
too 
complex 
for 
the 
scope 
of 
the 
recommendations 
and 
require 
specialist 
consultation.48 
Finally, 
awareness 
of 
SDB 
symptoms 
on 
the 
part 
of 
parents 
and 
physicians 
is 
very 
low.49,50 
Indeed, 
using 
an 
exit-interview 
strategy 
after 
pediatrician 
consultation, 
Blunden 
and 
colleagues50 
reported 
that 
among 
children 
with 
a 
significant 
history 
of 
snoring, 
only 
8% 
of 
parents 
mentioned 
this 
symptom 
during 
the 
concurrent 
clinical 
evaluation, 
and 
only 
15% 
had 
done 
so 
previously. 
The 
robustness 
of 
our 
findings 
on 
the 
relationship 
between 
sleep 
fragmentation 
(as 
evidenced 
by 
snore-
associated 
arousals) 
and 
the 
variance 
in 
mental 
development 
among 
healthy 
infants 
highlights 
the 
need 
to 
overcome 
these 
diagnostic 
screening 
challenges. 
Furthermore, 
we 
are 
unaware 
of 
any 
study 
that 
has 
examined 
potential 
mechanisms 
underlying 
this 
correlation, 
and, 
as 
such, 
we 
do 
not 
know 
whether 
such 
decrements 
in 
developmental 
achievement 
will 
persist 
or 
completely 
reverse 
on 
implementation 
of 
measures 
that 
aim 
to 
treat 
snoring 
in 
these 
infants. 
The 
possibility 
exists 
that 
if 
such 
infants 
are 
left 
untreated, 
then 
they 
may 
go 
on 
subsequently 
to 
develop 
SDB 
and 
its 
associated 
morbidities. 


CONCLUSIONS 


Snoring 
without 
evidence 
of 
apnea 
and/or 
hypopnea 
in 
8-month-old 
infants 
is 
associated 
with 
decreased 
scores 
on 
the 
MDI 
of 
the 
BSID-II 
when 
such 
snoring 
induces 
sleep 
fragmentation, 
the 
latter 
being 
apparently 
facilitated 
by 
cigarette-smoke 
exposure. 
We 
postulate 
that 
substantial 
reductions 
or 
elimination 
of 
exposure 
to 
secondhand 
cigarette 
smoke 
may 
ameliorate 
the 
developmental 
outcomes 
of 
snore-related 
arousals 
among 
some 
children.
