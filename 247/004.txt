Summary. Nasal 
corticosteroids 
improve 
polysomnography 
indices 
but 
not 
symptoms 
in 
children 
with 
mild 
to 
moderate 
sleep-disordered 
breathing. 
We 
hypothesized 
that 
administration 
of 
nasal 
corticosteroids 
for 
4 
weeks 
to 
snoring 
children 
with 
only 
mild 
elevation 
in 
their 
apnea-hypopnea 
index 
would 
improve 
both 
polysomnography 
findings 
and 
symptoms 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing. 
Budesonide 
50 
mcg 
per 
nostril 
twice 
daily 
was 
administered 
for 
4 
weeks 
to 
children 
(2–14 
years 
old) 
with 
habitual 
snoring 
and 
an 
apnea-hypopnea 
index 
of 
1–10 
episodes/hr. 
Subjects 
were 
evaluated 
before 
treatment 
and 
at 
2 
weeks 
and 
9 
months 
after 
its 
completion. 
Primary 
outcome 
variables 
were 
changes 
in 
apnea-hypopnea 
index 
and 
symptom 
score. 
Twenty-
seven 
children 
were 
studied. 
At 
2 
weeks, 
the 
mean 
apnea-hypopnea 
index 
decreased 
from 


5.2 
(2.2) 
episodes/hr 
to 
3.2 
(1.5) 
episodes/hr, 
and 
median 
oxygen 
desaturation 
of 
hemoglobin 
index 
fell 
from 
3.1 
(0.4–8.2) 
to 
1.9 
(0.2–5.4) 
(P 
< 
0.0001). 
Mean 
symptom 
score 
was 
1.33 
(2.11) 
at 
baseline, 
and 
decreased 
to 
0.008 
(2.24) 
at 
2 
weeks 
after 
treatment 
and 
to 
1.08 
(1.75) 
at 
9 
months 
after 
treatment 
(P 
< 
0.05). 
Four 
weeks 
of 
nasal 
budesonide 
improved 
both 
polysomnography 
findings 
and 
symptoms 
in 
children 
with 
mild 
sleep-disordered 
breathing. 
The 
clinical 
effect 
is 
maintained 
for 
several 
months 
after 
treatment.

INTRODUCTION 

Sleep-disordered 
breathing 
(SDB) 
in 
childhood 
describes 
a 
spectrum 
of 
abnormalities 
ranging 
from 
primary 
snoring 
to 
upper 
airway 
resistance 
syndrome 
to 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea-hypopnea 
(OSAH).1 
The 
most 
common 
symptoms 
associated 
with 
the 
disorder 
are 
habitual 
snoring, 
difficulty 
breathing, 
witnessed 
apneas, 
restless 
sleep, 
and 
daytime 
neurobehavioral 
problems. 


SDB 
is 
due 
to 
a 
combination 
of 
high 
upper 
airway 
resistance 
and 
low 
airway 
neuromuscular 
tone 
leading 
to 
prolonged 
partial 
and/or 
intermittent 
complete 
airway 
obstruction 
during 
sleep.2,3 
A 
6-week 
trial 
of 
nasal 
fluticasone 
demonstrated 
an 
improvement 
in 
polysomnography 
findings 
in 
children 
with 
mild 
to 
moderate 
OSAH 
but 
no 
significant 
amelioration 
of 
symptoms 
of 
SDB, 
as 
indicated 
by 
the 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
(OSA) 
symptom 
score.4,5 
The 
favorable 
change 
was 
attributed 
to 
a 
decrease 
of 
upper 
airway 
resistance 
by 
the 
effect 
of 
locally 
administered 
fluticasone 
on 
adenoidal 
hypertrophy 
and 
nasal 
mucosa 
inflammation.4,6,7 
Since 
the 
improvement 
in 
OSAH 
after 
use 
of 
nasal 
corticosteroids 
is 
modest, 
children 
with 
mild 
SDB 
may 
be 
better 
candidates 
for 
medical 
management 
in 
an 
attempt 
to 
avoid 
adenotonsillectomy.
7 


We 
hypothesized 
that 
administration 
of 
nasal 
corticosteroids 
would 
improve 
both 
polysomnography 
findings 


and 
the 
clinical 
picture 
of 
children 
with 
SDB 
symptoms 
and 
only 
a 
mild 
elevation 
in 
apnea-hypopnea 
index. 
We 
also 
hypothesized 
that 
improvement 
in 
symptoms 
after 
discontinuation 
of 
treatment 
would 
be 
maintained 
long-
term. 
To 
test 
our 
hypothesis, 
a 
prospective 
open-label 
study 
of 
nasal 
budesonide 
administered 
for 
4 
weeks 
to 
children 
with 
habitual 
snoring 
and 
mild 
abnormalities 
in 
polysomnography 
was 
conducted, 
and 
participants 
were 
evaluated 
at 
two 
time 
points 
after 
treatment.

PATIENTS AND METHODS 

Study Design and Evaluation of Subjects 

The 
study 
protocol 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
University 
of 
Thessaly 
Ethics 
Committee. 
Two-to 
14-year-old 
children 
were 
recruited 
from 
primary 
care 
clinics 
between 
January 
2001–December 
2002, 
based 
on 
the 
following 
inclusion 
criteria: 
1) 
history 
of 
habitual 
snoring 
(frequently 
or 
always 
present) 
for 
the 
last 
6 
months 
or 
longer,8 
and 
2) 
parental 
concern 
about 
their 
child’s 
breathing 
during 
sleep. 
Children 
were 
excluded 
from 
participation 
in 
the 
study 
if 
they 
fulfilled 
any 
of 
the 
exclusion 
criteria:1) 
presence 
of 
symptoms 
of 
acute 
respiratory 
tract 
infection; 
2) 
use 
of 
corticosteroids 
or 
antibiotics 
for 
4 
weeks 
prior 
to 
and 
during 
the 
study; 
3) 
apnea-hypopnea 
index 
at 
baseline 
lower 
than 
1 
episode/hr 
or 
higher 
than 
10 
episodes/hr; 
and 
4) 
a 
history 
of 
craniofacial, 
neuromuscular, 
or 
genetic 
disorders. 


During 
baseline 
evaluation, 
the 
parent 
and 
(whenever 
possible) 
the 
child 
were 
interviewed 
by 
one 
of 
the 
investigators, 
and 
a 
standard 
questionnaire 
was 
completed. 
Questions 
were 
answered 
by 
yes/no 
or 
by 
a 
4point 
frequency 
scale 
(0 
¼ 
never, 
1 
¼ 
occasionally, 
2 
¼ 
frequently, 
and 
3 
¼ 
always). 
They 
inquired 
about 
SDB 
symptoms 
for 
the 
last 
6 
months 
(frequency 
of 
snoring, 
difficulty 
breathing 
during 
sleep, 
and 
witnessed 
apneas), 
past 
medical 
history 
(history 
of 
chronic 
nasal 
obstruction, 
lower 
respiratory 
tract 
illness, 
and 
adenoidectomy 
and/or 
tonsillectomy), 
and 
exposure 
to 
cigarette 
smoke. 
The 
OSA 
symptom 
score 
was 
calculated 
as 
described 
previously 
by 
Brouillette 
et 
al.5 
Chronic 
nasal 
obstruction 
was 
defined 
as 
a 
history 
of 
congested 
nose 
for 
at 
least 
half 
of 
the 
days 
over 
the 
last 
6 
months 
or 
a 
physician’s 
diagnosis 
of 
chronic 
rhinitis. 
History 
of 
SDB 
and 
respiratory 
disorders 
in 
family 
members 
(snoring 
or 
chronic 
rhinitis) 
was 
also 
recorded. 


Each 
subject 
underwent 
a 
physical 
examination 
by 
one 
of 
the 
investigators, 
and 
the 
tonsillar 
size 
was 
graded 
from 
0–4þ, 
as 
described 
by 
others.9 
All 
children 
had 
lateral 
neck 
radiographs 
taken, 
and 
the 
adenoidal/nasopharyngeal 
diameter 
ratio 
was 
measured 
by 
a 
radiologist.10,11 
Adenoidal 
hypertrophy 
was 
defined 
as 
an 
adenoidal/ 
nasopharyngeal 
diameter 
ratio 
greater 
than 
0.5, 
and 
tonsillar 
hypertrophy 
was 
defined 
as 
tonsillar 
size 


2þ.8,10 
An 
overnight 
polysomnography 
study 
was 
also 
performed. 
Informed 
consent 
was 
obtained 
from 
parents 
of 
all 
participants 
in 
the 
trial. 
Administration 
of 
placebo 
was 
unacceptable 
by 
parents, 
and 
for 
this 
reason, 
a 
prospective 
open-label 
study 
without 
a 
control 
group 
was 
conducted. 
Children 
who 
were 
included 
in 
the 
trial 
received 
nasal 
budesonide, 
50 
mcg 
per 
nostril 
twice 
daily 
for 
4 
weeks. 
The 
4-week 
treatment 
duration 
was 
based 
on 
a 
previous 
report 
indicating 
that 
nasal 
beclomethasone 
administered 
for 
the 
same 
period 
of 
time 
improved 
symptoms 
and 


decreased 
the 
size 
of 
adenoids 
in 
children 
with 
nasal 
obstruction.6 
Parents 
were 
asked 
to 
record 
each 
dose 
of 
nasal 
budesonide 
that 
was 
administered. 
Two 
weeks 
after 
initiation 
of 
the 
medication, 
parents 
were 
contacted 
by 
an 
investigator 
to 
confirm 
compliance 
with 
the 
treatment 
regimen 
and 
to 
record 
any 
side 
effects. 


Two 
follow-up 
evaluations 
were 
performed. 
The 
first 
assessment 
was 
conducted 
2 
weeks 
after 
the 
end 
of 
the 
budesonide 
course. 
Parents 
and 
children 
were 
questioned 
about 
the 
presence 
of 
SDB 
symptoms 
during 
the 
2-week 
period 
following 
the 
end 
of 
treatment 
and 
about 
the 
number 
of 
budesonide 
doses 
that 
were 
administered. 
All 
subjects 
underwent 
repeat 
polysomnography 
at 
2 
weeks 
after 
completion 
of 
treatment. 
The 
second 
follow-up 
evaluation 
was 
carried 
out 
9 
months 
after 
the 
budesonide 
course. 
Parents 
were 
asked 
to 
report 
their 
child’s 
SDB 
symptoms 
which 
were 
present 
for 
most 
of 
the 
time 
between 
the 
first 
and 
second 
follow-up 
assessments. 


Polysomnography 

Polysomnography 
studies 
were 
performed 
overnight 
in 
the 
Sleep 
Disorders 
Laboratory 
of 
the 
Larissa 
University 
Hospital. 
Children 
were 
accompanied 
by 
a 
parent 
and 
supervised 
by 
a 
trained 
technician 
throughout 
the 
night. 
The 
following 
parameters 
were 
measured 
and 
recorded 
continuously 
on 
a 
computerized 
system 
(Alice 
4, 
Healthdyne, 
Marietta, 
GA) 
during 
the 
study: 
electroencephalogram 
(C3/A2, 
C4/A1, 
and 
O1/A2); 
right 
and 
left 
electrooculogram; 
submental 
and 
tibial 
electromyogram; 
electrocardiogram; 
thoracic 
and 
abdominal 
wall 
motion 
(piezoelectric 
transducers); 
oronasal 
airflow 
(threepronged 
thermistor); 
and 
oxygen 
saturation 
of 
hemoglobin 
(SaO2), 
using 
an 
oximeter. 
Bedtime 
and 
waking 
times 
were 
according 
to 
each 
subject’s 
routine, 
with 
polysomnography 
being 
terminated 
upon 
final 
awakening. 


Sleep 
stages 
and 
architecture 
were 
analyzed 
using 
standard 
criteria, 
and 
arousals 
were 
defined 
as 
recommended 
by 
the 
American 
Sleep 
Disorders 
Associa


tion.12,13 


Total 
sleep 
time 
was 
measured 
based 
on 
the 
electroencephalogram 
and 
the 
laboratory 
technician’s 
observations. 
Obstructive 
apnea 
was 
defined 
as 
the 
presence 
of 
chest/abdominal 
wall 
motion 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
airflow 
for 
at 
least 
two 
breaths’ 
duration.14,15 
Hypopnea 
was 
defined 
as 
a 
reduction 
in 
airflow 
signal 
amplitude 
of 
at 
least 
50% 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
chest/abdominal 
wall 
motion, 
associated 
with 
oxygen 
desaturation 
of 
hemoglobin 
equal 
to 
or 
greater 
than 
4% 
or 
with 
an 
arousal. 
Apnea-hypopnea 
index 
was 
the 
number 
of 
hypopneas 
and 
obstructive 
and 
mixed 
apneas 
(apneas 
with 
both 
central 
and 
obstructive 
components) 
per 
hour 
of 
sleep. 
Frequency 
of 
movement/ 
arousals 
terminating 
apneas 
and 
hypopneas 
determined 
the 
respiratory 
movement/arousal 
index.16 
The 
number 
of 
episodes 
per 
hour 
of 
oxygen 
desaturation 
of 
hemoglobin 
equal 
to 
or 
greater 
than 
4% 
defined 
the 
oxygen 



desaturation 
of 
hemoglobin 
index. 
The 
SaO2 
nadir 
and 
the 
percentage 
of 
total 
sleep 
time 
during 
which 
SaO2 
was 
less 
than 
95% 
were 
also 
calculated. 


Outcome Variables and Statistical Analysis 

Polysomnograms 
were 
scored 
and 
interpreted 
by 
one 
of 
the 
investigators 
who 
was 
blinded 
to 
the 
order 
of 
the 
study 
(before 
or 
after 
treatment) 
and 
who 
had 
not 
met 
any 
participating 
children 
or 
their 
parents. 
The 
primary 
outcome 
variables 
were: 
1) 
changes 
in 
apnea-hypopnea 
index 
(baseline 
and 
first 
follow-up 
evaluation, 
i.e., 
2 
weeks 
after 
the 
end 
of 
treatment), 
and 
2) 
changes 
in 
OSA 
symptom 
score 
(baseline, 
and 
first 
and 
second 
follow-up 
evaluations). 
Secondary 
outcome 
variables 
were 
changes 
in: 
apnea 
index, 
respiratory 
movement/arousal 
index, 
oxygen 
desaturation 
of 
hemoglobin 
index, 
SaO2 
nadir, 
percentage 
of 
total 
sleep 
time 
with 
SaO2 
less 
than 
95% 
(baseline 
and 
first 
follow-up 
evaluation), 
and 
symptom 
frequency 
(baseline, 
and 
first 
and 
second 
follow-up 
assessments). 
Results 
were 
expressed 
as 
mean 
values 
(standard 
deviation) 
or 
median 
(minimum–maximum 
values). 


Mean 
values 
for 
polysomnography 
indices 
at 
baseline 
and 
at 
first 
follow-up 
evaluation 
were 
compared 
by 
a 
paired 
t-test. 
The 
Wilcoxon 
signed 
rank 
sum 
test 
was 
used 
for 
data 
that 
were 
not 
normally 
distributed. 
Subjects 
were 
also 
divided 
into 
two 
subgroups, 
based 
on 
the 
apneahypopnea 
index 
before 
treatment: 
those 
with 
an 
index 
equal 
to 
or 
lower 
than 
5 
episodes/hr, 
and 
those 
with 
an 
index 
higher 
than 
5 
episodes/hr. 
Percent 
changes 
of 
polysomnography 
indices 
in 
relation 
to 
pretreatment 
values 
were 
compared 
in 
the 
two 
subgroups 
by 
an 
unpaired 
t-test. 


Statistical 
comparisons 
of 
changes 
in 
OSA 
symptom 
score 
and 
symptom 
frequency 
among 
baseline 
and 
first 
and 
second 
follow-up 
evaluations 
employed 
one-way 
analysis 
of 
variance 
(ANOVA). 
Subsequent 
pair 
comparisons 
were 
carried 
out 
with 
post 
hoc 
tests. 
For 
statistical 
analysis 
of 
changes 
in 
symptom 
frequency, 
the 
4-point 
frequency 
scale 
was 
used. 
For 
subjects 
who 
underwent 
adenoidectomy 
and 
tonsillestomy 
after 
the 
first 
follow-up 
assessment 
due 
to 
persistence 
of 
symptoms, 
it 
was 
assumed 
that 
symptom 
frequency 
would 
have 
been 
unchanged, 
had 
the 
second 
follow-up 
evaluation 
been 
carried 
out. 
A 
P-value 
of 
less 
than 
0.05 
was 
considered 
statistically 
significant. 


RESULTS 

Subjects’ Characteristics 

Seventy-seven 
patients 
were 
evaluated 
for 
possible 
participation 
in 
the 
study. 
Forty-six 
of 
74 
were 
excluded 
for 
the 
following 
reasons: 
use 
of 
corticosteroids 
(3), 
use 
of 
antibiotics 
(11), 
an 
apnea-hypopnea 
index 
lower 
than 
1 
episode/hr 
(25) 
or 
higher 
than 
10 
episodes/hr 
(6),

In 
total, 
31 
patients 
were 
eligible 
for 
recruitment, 
and 
informed 
consent 
was 
obtained 
for 
27 
of 
them. 
Compliance 
with 
the 
prescribed 
medication 
was 
excellent. 
Parents 
reported 
that 
at 
least 
13 
of 
14

respectively. 
Twenty-
four 
of 
27 
children 
had 
adenoidal 
hypertrophy, 
and 
25 
of 
27 
had 
tonsillar

Four 
subjects 
had 
already 
undergone 
adenoidectomy 
and/or 
tonsillectomy, 
and 
all 
four 
of 
them 
had 
chronic 
nasal 
obstruction. 
The 
mean 
OSA 
symptom 
score 
before 
treatment 
was 
1.33 
(2.11). 
For 
an 
appreciable 
proportion 
of 
children, 
a 
history 
of 
snoring 
was 
reported 
in 
the 
father, 
mother, 
or 
siblings 
(19 
of 
27, 
7 
of 
26, 
and 
5 
of 
26, 
respectively). 
A 
few 
subjects 
had 
a 
positive 
history 
of 
chronic

in 
the 
father, 
mother, 
or 
siblings 
(3 
of 
27, 
4 
of 
27, 
and 
6 
of 
26, 
respectively). 


Primary and Secondary Outcome Variables 

Two 
weeks 
after 
completion 
of 
budesonide 
treatment, 
there 
was 
a 
significant 
improvement 
in 
the 
apneahypopnea 
index 
(P 
< 
0.0001) 
(Table

The 
apneahypopnea 
index 
decreased 
in 
25 
of 
27 
children, 
increased 
in 
1 
of 
27, 
and 
did 
not 
change 
in 
1 
of 
27. 
The 
mean 
OSA

was 
1.33 
(2.11), 
0.008 
(2.24), 
and 
1.08 
(1.75) 
at 
baseline 
and 
first 
and 
second 
follow-up 
assessments, 
respectively. 
There 
was 
no

at 
2 
weeks 
and 
at 
9 
months 
after 
treatment 
(P

between

(P

but 
it 
was 
similar 
between 
the 
first 
and 
second 
follow-up 
assessments 
(P

Tonsillar 
size 
was 
the 
same 
compared 
to 
baseline 
in 
all 
subjects 
after 
treatment 
with 
budesonide. 
There 
was 
no 
correlation 
between 
symptom

or 
OSA 
symptom 
score 
and 
any 
of 
the 
polysomnography 
indices 
either 
before 
or 
after 
budesonide 
treatment 
(Spearman’s

According 
to 
parents’ 
perception, 
their 
child’s 
breathing 
during 
sleep 
improved 
in 
23 
of 
27 
children, 
and 
was 
the 
same 
or 
deteriorated 
in 
4 
of 
27 
following 
treatment 
with 
budesonide. 
After 
the 
first 
follow-up 
clinical 
and 
polysomnography 
assessment, 
adenoidectomy 
and 
tonsillectomy 
were 
performed 
in 
3 
of 
27 
subjects. 
Four 
other 
children 
had 
already 
undergone 
adenoidectomy 
and/or 
tonsillectomy 
prior 
to 
participation 
in 
the 
study. 
During 
the 
second 
follow-up 
evaluation, 
parents 
reported 
that 
breathing 
was 
still 
improved 
compared 
to 
baseline 
in 
21 
of 
24 
subjects, 
and 
was 
the 
same 
or 
deteriorated 
in 
3 
of 
24. 
No 
side 
effects 
possibly 
related 
to 
administration 
of 
a 
corticosteroid 
intranasally 
(e.g., 
epistaxis, 
nasal 
dryness, 
nasal 
irritation, 
or 
cushingoid 
face) 
were 
reported.

Nasal Steroids for Children With Snoring 165 


Fig. 1. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) symptom scores for 
individual subjects before budesonide treatment (1), 2 weeks 
after end of treatment (2), and 9 months after end of treatment (3). 
Mean OSA symptom score was higher before treatment 

(1.33 . 
2.11) compared to 2 weeks (--0.008 . 
2.24) and 9 months 
after treatment (P 
< 0.0001), but there was no difference between 
2 weeks and 9 months (P 
> 0.05). 
after 
a 
4-week 
trial 
of 
nasal 
budesonide. 
The 
favorable 
change 
in 
SDB 
symptom 
frequency 
was 
maintained 
for 
at 
least 
9 
months 
after 
completion 
of 
treatment. 
This 
investigation 
replicates 
and 
extends 
the 
results 
of 
a 
published 
randomized, 
double-blind, 
placebo-controlled 
study 
that 
revealed 
improvement 
in 
polysomnography 
findings 
after 
treating 
children 
with 
mild 
to 
moderate 
SDB 
with 
nasal 
fluticasone 
for 
6 
weeks.4 
In 
the 
fluticasone 
trial, 
no 
improvement 
in 
SDB 
symptoms 
was 
noted. 


Adenotonsillectomy 
is 
the 
standard 
treatment 
for 
children 
with 
symptoms 
of 
SDB 
and 
polysomnography 
findings 
consistent 
with 
OSAH.17 
However, 
the 
procedure 
is 
not 
devoid 
of 
potential 
postoperative 
complications, 
including 
bleeding, 
upper 
airway 
obstruction, 
and 
post-
obstructive 
pulmonary 
edema, 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
emotional 
distress 
for 
the 
young 
patient 
and 
her 
family.18,19 
The 
degree 
of 
severity 
of 
SDB 
which 
justifies 
performance 
of 
adenotonsillectomy 
is 
not 
yet 
well-established. 
For 
all 
the 
previous 
reasons, 
medical 
alternatives 
to 
surgery, 
such 
as 
nasal 
corticosteroids, 
have 
been 
proposed 
for 
the 
treatment 
of 
children 
with 
SDB.4,6,8 


In 
our 
series, 
the 
baseline 
adenoidal/nasopharyngeal 
diameter 
ratio 
was 
lower 
(0.72 
. 
0.06) 
than 
the 
same 
index 
in 
the 
study 
by 
Brouillette 
et 
al.4 
(0.76 
. 
0.03 
in 
the 
fluticasone 
group; 
0.79 
. 
0.03 
in 
the 
placebo 
group). 
This 
difference 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
lower 
apnea-hypopnea 
index 
before 
treatment 
in 
the 
former 
(5.2 
. 
2.2 
episodes/ 
hr) 
compared 
to 
the 
latter 
(10.7 
. 
2.6 
in 
the 
fluticasone 
group; 
11 
. 
2.3 
in 
the 
placebo 
group). 
A 
lower 
oxygen 
desaturation 
of 
hemoglobin 
index 
(median, 
3.1; 
minimum–maximum, 
0.4–8.2 
episodes/hour) 
and 
higher 
SaO2 
nadir 
(median, 
88%; 
minimum–maximum, 
78– 
93%) 
were 
also 
recorded 
in 
our 
trial, 
compared 
to 
the 
same 
indices 
in 
the 
study 
by 
Brouillette 
et 
al.4 
(desaturation 
index, 
7 
. 
2 
episodes/hr; 
and 
SaO2 
nadir, 
85.9 
. 
1.7% 
in 
the 
fluticasone 
group; 
desaturation 
index, 
5.6 
. 
2 
episodes/
hr; 
and 
SaO2 
nadir, 
86.6 
. 
1.2% 
in 
the 
placebo 
group). 
Overall, 
children 
in 
this 
investigation 
had 
findings 
consistent 
with 
mild 
SDB, 
whereas 
the 
subjects 
of 
the 
fluticasone 
study 
had 
mild 
to 
moderate 
SDB. 


In 
the 
study 
by 
Brouillette 
et 
al.,4 
a 
decrease 
of 
about 
50–60% 
in 
the 
apnea-hypopnea 
index 
and 
in 
the 
oxygen 
desaturation 
of 
hemoglobin 
index 
was 
noted 
after 
the 
fluticasone 
course. 
This 
degree 
of 
improvement 
in 
polysomnography 
indices 
may 
have 
not 
been 
enough 
to 
make 
apparent 
significant 
changes 
in 
symptoms 
of 
SDB 
as 
measured 
by 
the 
OSA 
symptom 
score, 
given 
the 
severity 
of 
SDB 
before 
treatment. 
In 
contrast, 
in 
this 
series, 
significant 
clinical 
improvement 
(OSA 
symptom 
score 
and 
symptom 
frequency) 
accompanied 
a 
decrease 
of 
about 
40% 
in 
the 
apnea-hypopnea 
and 
desaturation 
indices. 
The 
majority 
of 
parents 
also 
reported 
an 
improvement 
in 
their 
child’s 
breathing 
during 
sleep. 
These 
different 
findings 
compared 
to 
the 
results 
of 
the 
fluticasone 
trial 
may 
be 
explained 
in 
part 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
our 
patients 
had 
only 
mild 
SDB. 


Children 
with 
more 
severe 
SDB 
before 
treatment 
(apnea-hypopnea 
index 
>5 
episodes/hr) 
had 
similar 
percent 
changes 
in

indices 
compared 
to 
those 
with 
less 
severe 
SDB 
(apnea-hypopnea

This 
is 
an 
interesting 
finding, 
since 
symptomatic 
snoring 
children 
in 
most 
North 
America 
institutions 
with 
an 
apnea-hypopnea 
index 
greater 
than 
5 
episodes/hr 
are 
usually 
referred 
for 
adenotonsillectomy.17 


Most 
importantly, 
clinical 
improvement 
was 
maintained 
for 
at 
least 
9 
months 
after 
the 
treatment 
intervention. 
The 
beneficial 
effect 
of 
nasal 
corticosteroids 
on 
SDB 
has 
been 
attributed 
to 
a 
reduction 
in 
the 
size 
of 
adenoids 
and/or 
tonsils, 
or 
a 
decrease 
in 
the 
degree 
of 
nasal 
mucosa 
inflammation.4,6 
Of 
note, 
20 
of 
27 
subjects 
in 
the 
present 
investigation 
had 
chronic 
nasal 
obstruction, 
and 
24 
of 
27 
were 
found 
to 
have 
adenoidal 
hypertrophy 
by 
radiography 
prior 
to 
treatment 
with 
budesonide. 
No 
repeat 
lateral 
neck 
radiographs 
were 
conducted 
during 
follow-up 
assessments 
to 
determine 
the 
size 
of 
adenoids. 
In 
Brouillette 
et 
al.,4 
no 
significant 
change 
in 
the 
adenoidal/
nasopharyngeal 
diameter 
ratio 
was 
identified 
after 
completion 
of 
the 
fluticasone 
course. 


Four 
children 
had 
already 
undergone 
adenoidectomy 
and/or 
tonsillectomy 
prior 
to 
recruitment 
(4 
of 
27, 
or 
15%), 
and 
three 
more 
children 
(3 
of 
27, 
or 
11%) 
underwent 
adenoidectomy 
and 
tonsillectomy 
after 
the 
budesonide 
trial. 
This 
last 
finding 
is 
in 
contrast 
to 
results 
reported 
by 
Criscuoli 
et 
al.8 
At 
the 
end 
of 
the 
first-year 
observation 
period, 
surgery 
had 
been 
required 
for 
25–59% 
of 
subjects 
with 
nasal 
obstruction 
and 
adenoidal 
or 
tonsillar 
hypertrophy 
that 
were 
treated 
with 
beclomethasone 
intranasally 
for 
a 
total 
of 
26 
weeks. 
Criscuoli 
et 
al. 
used 
the 
nasal 
obstruction 
index20 
to 
assess 
their 
patients. 
It 
is 
therefore 
difficult 
to 
compare 
subjects 
of 
the 
present 
investigation 
to 
those 
of 
the 
previous 
report.8 


No 
side 
effects 
associated 
with 
the 
administration 
of 
a 
corticosteroid 
were 
observed. 
In 
Greece, 
nasal 
budesonide 
is 
licensed 
for 
use 
in 
patients 
older 
than 
4 
years. 
Five 
of 
27 
subjectsinthis 
investigationwere2–4 
yearsold.Nasal 
fluticasone 
(100–200 
mcg/day 
for 
6 
weeks) 
and 
nasal 
budesonide 
(200 
mcg/day 
for 
3 
weeks) 
were 
given 
to 
children 
younger 
than 
5 
years 
in 
two 
other 
published 
reports.4,21 
Three 
more 
studies 
did 
not 
report 
an 
effect 
on 
the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal 
axis 
when 
nasal 
corticosteroids 
(mometasone 
50–200 
mcg/day; 
fluticasone 
100–200 
mcg/day; 
and 
budesonide 
200 
mcg/day) 
were 
used 
in 
children 
2–5 
years 
old 
for 
2–6 
weeks.22–24 
Steroid 
side 
effects 
were 
reported 
after 
administration 
of 
the 
previous 
medications 
to 
preschool 
children 
for 
several 
months.25 


Unfortunately 
in 
our 
study, 
the 
use 
of 
placebo 
was 
not 
acceptable 
by 
parents. 
However, 
it 
is 
unlikely 
that 
the 
recorded 
improvement 
in 
SDB 
symptoms 
and 
polysomnography 
indices 
would 
occur 
without 
treatment, 
since 
participants 
were 
symptomatic 
for 
at 
least 
6 
months 
preceding 
recruitment 
in 
this 
trial. 
Of 
interest, 
in 
the 
report 
by 
Brouillette 
et 
al.,4 
the 
apnea-hypopnea 
index 
in 
the 
placebo 
group 
deteriorated 
during 
the 
treatment 
period. 
In 
the 
trial 
by 
Criscuoli 
et 
al. 
of 
nasal 
beclomethasone 
used 
in 


children 
with 
chronic 
nasal 
obstruction 
and 
adenoidal 
or 
tonsillar 
hypertrophy,8 
intranasal 
administration 
of 
saline 
solution 
was 
not 
associated 
with 
any 
significant 
change 
in 
symptoms. 
Confirmation 
of 
our 
results 
by 
a 
randomized, 
double-blind, 
placebo-controlled 
trial 
in 
a 
similar 
group 
of 
children 
with 
mild 
SDB 
would 
be 
useful. 


Limitations 
of 
the 
current 
investigation 
include 
its 
open-label 
design 
and 
the 
use 
of 
symptom 
frequency 
and 
symptom 
score 
to 
evaluate 
long-term 
efficacy 
of 
treatment 
with 
nasal 
budesonide. 
It 
is 
well-known 
that 
clinical 
history 
does 
not 
reflect 
severity 
of 
SDB 
as 
determined 
by 
polysomnography.26 
However, 
most 
parents 
were 
reluctant 
to 
bring 
their 
children 
for 
a 
third 
sleep 
study. 
Finally, 
due 
to 
concerns 
of 
the 
investigators 
about 
re-exposing 
children 
to 
radiation, 
the 
size 
of 
adenoids 
was 
not 
assessed 
posttreatment 
by 
follow-up 
lateral 
neck 
radiographs. 


Administration 
of 
nasal 
budesonide 
to 
children 
with 
an 
AHI 
higher 
than 
5 
episodes/hr 
prevented 
the 
need 
for 
adenotonsillectomy, 
while 
a 
significant 
decrease 
in 
frequency 
of 
SDB 
symptoms 
was 
observed 
in 
subjects 
with 
an 
AHI 
equal 
to 
or 
lower 
than 
5 
episodes/hr. 
Narrowing 
of 
the 
upper 
airway 
during 
sleep 
occurs 
at 
a 
variable 
degree 
within 
a 
population.27 
The 
severity 
of 
increase 
in 
upper 
airway 
resistance 
that 
requires 
treatment 
should 
be 
determined 
by 
the 
associated 
morbidity, 
but 
currently 
it 
is 
uncertain 
what 
constitutes 
pathology.28 
In 
this 
investigation, 
the 
presence 
of 
habitual 
snoring 
for 
at 
least 
6 
months, 
and 
parental 
concern 
about 
the 
child’s 
breathing 
during 
sleep, 
were 
considered 
adequate 
indications 
to 
use 
nasal 
budesonide 
for 
4 
weeks, 
a 
rather 
benign 
treatment. 


In 
conclusion, 
the 
present 
study 
identified 
a 
beneficial 
effect 
of 
nasal 
budesonide 
on 
both 
polysomnography 
indices 
and 
clinical 
symptoms 
in 
children 
with 
mild 
SDB. 
Improvement 
in 
SDB 
symptoms 
following 
administration 
of 
nasal 
corticosteroids 
was 
maintained 
for 
several 
months 
after 
discontinuation 
of 
the 
medication. 
Children 
with 
mild 
SDB 
may 
be 
appropriate 
candidates 
for 
a 
therapeutic 
trial 
with 
nasal 
corticosteroid 
in 
an 
attempt 
to 
avoid 
adenotonsillectomy.
