OBJECTIVE: 
To assess the long-term (3-5 years) success of 
adenoidectomy and reasons for unsatisfactory results. 
STUDY 
DESIGN 
AND 
SETTING: 
The parents of all children 
who underwent adenoidectomy alone at a major tertiary 
center from 1998 to 2000 were asked to complete a questionnaire 
assessing their child’s well-being and symptomatology 3-5 
years after surgery; some were invited for follow-up. Symptom 
improvement, persistent symptoms, and adenoid regrowth were 
evaluated. 
RESULTS: 
Among the 206 parents who complied, 74%-87% 
reported improvement in all main symptoms: nasal obstruction, 
snoring, chronic rhinorrhea, hyponasal speech, and obstructive 
sleep disorder. At follow-up (n . 
36), the symptomatic patients 
had significantly more anatomic nasal abnormalities (P 
. 
0.01) 
and a higher rate of significant adenoid enlargement (P 
. 
0.08), 3 
patients (19%) vs none (0%). 
CONCLUSIONS 
AND 
SIGNIFICANCE: 
Adenoidectomy alone 
is satisfactory treatment for nasal obstruction and obstructive sleep 
apnea in selected children. Though some adenoid regrowth is not 
rare, clinically significant adenoid regrowth is infrequent. Persistent 
or recurrent symptoms are attributable mainly to nasal pathology.

denoidectomy and tonsillectomy are among the most 
common pediatric operations.1 Adenoidectomy is recommended 
for the treatment of upper airway obstruction 
and recurrent or chronic adenoiditis, which may present as 
chronic rhinosinusitis or chronic otitis media with effusion. 
However, its use for the last indication has declined in the 
last years because of concerns about effectiveness.1 At the 
same time, awareness of the potentially serious sequelae of 

upper airway obstruction has increased, and more adenoidectomies 
are now being done for this indication. Specifically, 
complications include learning difficulties, behavioral 
changes, and, in severe cases, failure to thrive, pulmonary 
hypertension, and secondary right-side cardiac hypertrophy.
2 Adenoid obstruction may also lead to an open anterior 
bite and “adenoid facies” caused by the maxillary and mandibular 
structural changes that are believed to occur secondary 
to chronic mouth breathing;2 however, this finding is 
still controversial.3,4 In addition, adenotonsillar hypertrophy 
can affect patient well-being, causing sleep disturbances, 
nasal obstruction, chronic rhinitis, speech and swallowing 
disorders, and emotional distress. Though different studies 
reported 70% to 100% improvement in quality of life 
(QOL) and various symptoms following adenotonsillectomy,
5-9 we were unable to find a specific validated QOL 
questionnaire targeted to patients after adenoidectomy without 
tonsillectomy. 

The data in the literature on recurrence after adenoidectomy 
are limited mainly to individual cases of adenoid 
regrowth with persistent nasopharyngeal obstruction. Although 
Buchinsky et al10 failed to find a new obstructing 
adenoid pad after adenoidectomy in a large series of children, 
we have encountered contrary findings in clinical 
practice. The suggested explanation for adenoid regrowth or 
persistence is related to the difference in surgical technique 
between adenoidectomy and tonsillectomy. In tonsillectomy, 
the whole organ is removed under direct vision. In 
adenoidectomy, the approach to the nasopharynx is indirect, 
and as the adenoids are lymphatic vegetations without discrete 
borders, it is more difficult to completely remove 
them.

Joshua et al Adenoidectomy: Long-term follow-up 577 

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the long-
term effectiveness of adenoidectomy in symptom relief and 
the rates and reasons for symptom recurrence. 

MATERIALS 
AND 
METHODS 


We reviewed the charts of all patients who underwent adenoidectomy 
alone (ie, without tonsillectomy and not combined 
with ventilation tube insertion) at the Schneider 
Children’s Medical Center of Israel from 1998 to 2000. The 
study protocol was approved by the institutional review 
board. 

In all cases, the procedure was performed under general 
anesthesia by one of several senior pediatric otolaryngologists. 
The tongue was retracted with a Crow-Davis retractor. 
Some of the surgeons inspected the nasopharynx and 
performed curettage under direct vision with a laryngeal 
mirror, whereas others palpated the nasopharynx to verify 
the patency of the nasal choanae. A curette was used to 
remove the bulk of the adenoids, and a large gauze ball was 
squeezed into the nasopharynx for hemostasis. Infrequently, 
when bleeding persisted, suction electrocautery was used. 

For the present study, data were collected on patient age, 
sex, and symptoms before surgery. Findings on sleep studies 
were not included, as our department limits them to 
children younger than 18 months, children with risk factors 
for surgery, and children whose parents cannot provide an 
adequate history or whose physician cannot reach a treatment 
recommendation. The parents were asked to complete 
an ad hoc telephone questionnaire wherein the change in 
specific symptoms (chronic mouth breathing, rhinorrhea, 
snoring, restless sleep, sleep apnea, hyponasal speech, 
cough, eating disturbances, learning and behavioral problems) 
was scored on a 5-point scale as follows: 0, not 
relevant; 1, worse; 2, no change; 3, improved; 4, resolved. 
Additional parameters in the questionnaire were child’s 
allergic status and presence of asthma, scored as “yes/no,” 
and child’s general health and well-being, and parental 
satisfaction with the surgery, graded on the same scale as 
the symptoms. 

The patients reported to have persistent or recurrent 
symptoms (scores 1,2) were invited for follow-up. Their 
findings were compared to those of patients similar in size 
and age with no reported symptoms (scores 3,4) who were 
invited for follow-up as well. Both groups underwent a 
complete head and neck evaluation, including flexible fiberoptic 
nasal endoscopy, by a senior pediatric otolaryngologist 
(E.R.) who was aware of the symptoms reported by the 
parent. The degree of adenoid obstruction was evaluated as 
follows: 

Grade 1: no or minimal adenoid tissue (0%-25% obstruc


tion); 
Grade 2: small amount of adenoid tissue (26%-50% obstruc


tion); 

Grade 3: large amount of adenoid tissue that might cause 

symptomatic nasal obstruction (51%-75% obstruction); 
Grade 4: obstructing adenoid tissue (76%-100% obstruction). 

Tonsillar hypertrophy was graded as follows:11,12 

Grade I: tonsils located in the tonsillar fossa, barely seen 

behind the anterior pillars; 
Grade II: tonsils visible behind the anterior pillars; 
Grade III: tonsils extend three-quarters of the way to the 

midline; 
Grade IV: tonsils completely obstruct the airway. 

Statistical 
Analysis 


Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and the significance for it 

(P) were calculated between the variables. To analyze statistically 
significant differences between the groups in the 
distribution of categorical variables, we used 2 test or 
Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. P 
values less than or 
equal to 0.05 were considered statistically significant. 
RESULTS 


Of the 270 children identified by chart review who underwent 
adenoidectomy alone between 1998 and 2000, we 
located 206 (80 girls, 39% and 126 boys, 61%) whose 
parents agreed to participate in the study. The parents were 
contacted 3 to 5 years after surgery. 

Mean patient age was 6.5 years (range, 2-17) at the time 
of adenoidectomy. The symptoms before surgery are presented 
in Table 1. Nasal obstruction, snoring, and chronic 
rhinorrhea were the most frequent symptoms. Eighteen children 
(9%) were reported to be asthmatic and 23 (11.1%), 
allergic. 

Figure 1 shows the findings from the questionnaire. For 
the individual symptoms, the reported improvement rate 
was 74% to 87%. The rate of general satisfaction was 84%, 
with 8% of the parents reporting no change and 8% reporting 
worsening of symptoms. General health improved in 
56% of the patients, did not change in 41%, and deteriorated 
in 3%.

Thirty-six patients presented for follow-up: 16 of the 32 
patients with no improvement or worsening of symptoms 
(score 1,2) and 20 of the 174 with improved symptoms 
(score 3,4). Table 2 shows the pathologic upper airway 
findings on reexamination of both groups 3 to 5 years after 
surgery. The nasal anatomy was distorted (ie, deviated septum) 
in 10 patients (63%) in the symptomatic group and 4 
(20%) in the asymptomatic group (P 
. 
0.01). Recurrent 
adenoid hypertrophy (grade 2,3,4) was noted in 4 symptomatic 
patients (25%) and 3 asymptomatic patients (15%). If 
only grades 3 and 4 were considered clinically significant 
adenoid hypertrophy, then all obstructing adenoids were in 
the symptomatic group (3/16 vs 0/20, P 
. 
0.08). There was 
no between-group difference in tonsil size or diseased nasal 
mucosa. 

Table 3 shows the number and type of pathologies in 
individual patients in the symptomatic group at follow-up. 
Only 2 patients did not have obstructive physical findings. 
Nasal pathology was the most common finding, in 13 patients 
(81%), followed by tonsillar hypertrophy (grades III,

Division of the sample by age at the time of surgery 
yielded no association with general parental satisfaction,

adenoid regrowth, or tonsillar hypertrophy on follow-up. 
The only significant association was for allergy (r . 
0.16, 
P

allergies, which could cause nasal obstruction, though this 
factor did not affect surgical success. 

DISCUSSION 


The present study shows that adenoidectomy is an effective 
procedure for the relief of nasal obstruction, with a more 
than 80% rate of satisfaction in our series. These findings 
are in line with the reported surgical success rates of 70% to 
100%.5-9 However, caregivers should be made aware at the 
time of surgery that in 15% of children, symptoms do not 
resolve. The reasons for failure seem to be related mainly to 
nasal pathology (81%): either a nasal mucosal or structural 
abnormality. However, it is well known that deviated septum 
and mucosal hypertrophy are not well defined. Less

Joshua et al Adenoidectomy: Long-term follow-up 579 

frequent pathologies found here in the failed group were 
tonsillar hypertrophy (44%) and grades 3/4 adenoid hypertrophy 
(19%). Most of these patients had persistent or recurrent 
symptoms of snoring with or without apnea, and 
some complained of mouth breathing or rhinorrhea. These 
findings stress the need for nasal endoscopy in the reevaluation 
of patients with persistent or recurrent symptoms 
after adenoidectomy. A significant proportion (19%) of 
those with treatment failure may be expected to have nasopharyngeal 
obstructive adenoids. There was no correlation 
between the level of improvement of any specific symptom 
and specific pathologic findings on physical examination 
(P 
. 
0.1). For example, persistent snoring was not associated 
with tonsillar hypertrophy, and oral breathing was not 
associated with nasal pathology. This finding might be explained 
by the small size of the group in whom surgery was 
unsuccessful. 

Thirty-one percent of the patients examined had tonsillar 
hypertrophy (grade III or IV): 20% of the symptomatic 
group and 44% of the asymptomatic group. This difference 
did not reach statistical significance (P 
. 
0.35), again perhaps 
because of the small sample size. Interestingly, both of 
the patients who had tonsillar hypertrophy grade IV were in 
the asymptomatic group. This observation is in line with our 
experience that “kissing tonsils” can sometimes be found in 
completely asymptomatic children. 

Though the rate of tonsillar hypertrophy was low, it 
raises concerns as to why tonsillectomy was not performed 
concomitant with adenoidectomy in these patients. It is 
unclear, because of the retrospective nature of the study, if 
the tonsils were large to begin with or grew after adenoidectomy. 
Shintani et al6 found no difference in success rate 
between adenoidectomy alone (80%) and adenotonsillectomy 
(84%) in children with upper airway obstruction. 
More recently, Shatz13 described an excellent experience 
with adenoidectomy alone for infants with obstructive sleep 
apnea. Only one study5 found adenoidectomy alone to be 
insufficient. These authors reported that 70% of their group 
of children with polysomnography-proven obstructive sleep 
apnea had already undergone adenoidectomy. Since the 
symptoms improved after tonsillectomy was performed, 
they concluded that adenoidectomy alone “is not enough.” 
However, their study was limited by a selection bias, in that 
the number of patients who improved with adenoidectomy 
alone was not mentioned. To be “on the safe side,” many 
surgeons tend to perform adenoidectomy together with tonsillectomy 
for the treatment of obstructive upper airway 
disease.2,14 In our center, however, because tonsillectomy 
has a higher morbidity and mortality rate than adenoidectomy, 
we opt for adenoidectomy alone in patients with 
obstructive sleep apnea and normal-or near-normal-sized 
tonsils. Additional factors that influence the decision are 
patient age, symptom severity or polysomnographic findings, 
and the personal experience of the surgeon. This approach 
is supported by the present findings of a high success 
rate for adenoidectomy alone, combined with the fact that 

the hypertrophy of the tonsils was not necessarily significant. 
A larger prospective randomized study comparing 
adenoidectomy to adenotonsillectomy is needed. 

We expected age to be a factor in surgical success because 
the lymphatic tissue in Waldeyer’s ring is largest in 
relation to the pharynx in children 2 to 5 years old.2 After 
this age, involution takes place, combined with the natural 
growth of the skeleton and the airway dimensions, leading 
to a natural resolution of the obstruction. The natural growth 
spurt of the lymphatic tissue at this age may also lead to a 
high rate of adenoid regrowth. Therefore, although younger 
children might benefit more from surgery because of their 
smaller airway dimensions and the absence of related problems, 
such as allergies (which usually appear later), we 
believe that when symptoms do not impair QOL, a “watchand-
wait” approach may be expedient. 

In the present study, we noted a positive correlation 
between age and allergy (r . 
0.16, P 
. 
0.02), indicating 
that in older children, adenoid hypertrophy was not the only 
problem. Indeed, allergy can cause nasal obstruction and 
may explain the persistence of symptoms in some cases. 
Allergic symptoms have been called the “atopic march,” 
progressing from atopic dermatitis to allergic rhinitis and 
asthma.15 The prevalence of allergic rhinitis in childhood 

40%.16,17

may be up to Rates of allergic disease have 
increased in the last 20 years, though at varying rates among 
countries and age groups, peaking in the second and third 
decades of life.17,18 In Israel, the current prevalence of 
allergic rhinitis in schoolchildren is 9.4%,17 which is close 
to the rate in the present series (11%). 

We examined 16 of the total 32 symptomatic patients in 
our series and found that 3/16 (19%) had significant (grade 
3 or 4) adenoid regrowth. By contrast, our examination of 
20 out of the 174 asymptomatic patients yielded none with 
significant adenoid regrowth. If we include grade 2 adenoid 
hypertrophy as recurrence, the regrowth rate may be calculated 
as 4/16 (25%) symptomatic patients and 3/20 (15%) 
asymptomatic patients. However, in all 3 affected asymptomatic 
patients, the regrowth was not significant (grade 2), 
and of the 4 affected symptomatic patients, only one had 
grade 2 hypertrophy, but he also had a deviated nasal septum 
as well as grade 3 tonsils. Taking these data into 
consideration, our study shows that significant adenoid 
regrowth that causes nasal obstruction occurs infrequently, 
although the presence of some adenoid regrowth 
is not rare (15%-25%). As clinically significant adenoid 
regrowth occurred in only 20% of the symptomatic 
group, which accounted for only 15% of the total patients, 
we may conclude that the actual recurrence rate 
after adenoidectomy is 3%. 

This report is limited by the small number of failures 
and by the absence of polysomnography studies, which 
are not routinely performed in our center, making it 
impossible to objectively differentiate primary snorers 
from patients with overt obstructive sleep apnea. Another 


Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery, Vol 135, No 4, October 2006 

shortcoming of our study is that only 36 out of 206 
patients were examined. 

CONCLUSIONS 


Adenoidectomy alone is an effective short-and long-term 
treatment for nasal obstruction and obstructive sleep symptoms 
in children. Persistent symptoms are usually due to 
nasal pathology. Although findings of some adenoid regrowth 
are not unusual, significant symptomatic regrowth 
may be expected in 3% of operated patients. 

Larger prospective studies are warranted to confirm the 
success of adenoidectomy in obstructive sleep apnea and to 
determine the possible effect of age.
