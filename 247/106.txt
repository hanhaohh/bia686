ABSTRACT 
Objective: Conduct problems and hyperactivity are frequent among children referred for sleep-disordered breathing 
(SDB), restless legs syndrome, or periodic leg movements during sleep (PLMS), but children not referred to sleep centers 
have received little study. Method: Parents of children aged 2 to 14 years were surveyed at two general clinics 
between 1998 and 2000.A Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire generated validated scores for SDB and PLMS.The Conners 
Parent Rating Scale (CPRS-48) produced an age- and sex-adjusted Conduct Problem Index (CPI) and Hyperactivity 
Index. Results: Parents of about 1,400 children were approached; those of 872 (62%) completed the surveys. Bullying 
and other specific aggressive behaviors were generally two to three times more frequent among 114 children at high 
risk for SDB than among the remaining children. An association between high CPI and SDB scores (p < .0001) retained 
significance after adjustment for sleepiness, high Hyperactivity Index, stimulant use, or PLMS scores. Analogous results 
were obtained for the association between high CPI and PLMS scores. Conclusions: Conduct problems were associated 
with symptoms of SDB, restless legs syndrome, and PLMS. Although these results cannot prove a cause-and-effect 
relationship, assessment for sleep disorders may provide a new treatment opportunity for some aggressive children. J.

Conduct disorder is among the most common psychiatric 
conditions in children, with a prevalence of about 8% 
between the ages of 4 and 16 years (Offord et al., 1987). 
Aggressive behavior is often a key feature and is predictive 
of delinquency, alcoholism, drug abuse, antisocial

personality disorder, theft, violence, other crimes, and 
family relationship difficulties (Robins and Price, 1991). 
Though incompletely understood, the causes of childhood 
aggression are presumed to be heterogeneous, involving 
both environmental and genetic components. Parent 
rearing methods, interactions with parents and peers, 
social adversity, and common comorbid psychiatric conditions, 
such as hyperactivity, may all play important roles 
(Scott, 1998). 

One type of comorbidity suggested in published literature 
but not extensively studied are sleep disorders. 
Aggression is a common feature in case series of children 
with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), as are inattention 
and hyperactivity (Guilleminault et al., 1981). The latter 
tend to improve when SDB is treated, and aggression may 
also improve (Ali et al., 1996). Restless legs syndrome and 
periodic leg movements during sleep (PLMS) also appear 
to be common among hyperactive children (Picchietti 
et al., 1998), and again treatment of these sleep disorders 
may improve daytime behavior (Walters et al., 2000). 
Whether aggression is also common in children with these 
sleep disorders, however, has not been studied.

CHERVIN ET AL. 

Sleep disorders are often undiagnosed, and studies have 
not yet addressed the question of whether SDB, PLMS, 
and restless legs syndrome are common among the large 
group of children with aggressive behavior, bullying, or 
conduct problems. We asked parents of children with 
appointments at general pediatric clinics to complete validated 
questionnaires about their children’s sleep and daytime 
behavior. The main prospective aim was to study 
inattention and hyperactivity (Chervin et al., 2002a,b), 
but measures of aggression also were included and form 
the basis for this report. 

METHOD 

Subjects 

Recruitment methods for this cohort have been described in detail 
(Chervin et al., 2001). Parents of children seen at two general pediatrics 
clinics signed an institutional review board–approved informed 
consent, and children older than 9 years or able to understand the 
study signed an informed assent. Criteria for inclusion were as follows: 
(1) age 2.00 to 13.99 years, (2) ability of the parent to read and 
write English, and (3) absence of mental or physical impairment severe 
enough to prevent interpretation of behavioral information collected. 
Subjects were enrolled between February 6, 1998, and May 1, 2000. 
At the two university-owned sites, nine pediatricians see primarily 
community-based populations. Ethnicity, socioeconomic (insurance) 
data, medical conditions, and medications prescribed for the children 
in this cohort have been described previously (Archbold et al., 2002). 
Data for each child were included in this report if at least two thirds 
of the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire and Conduct Problem Index 
(described below) had been completed. 

Measures 

Parents completed the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire in waiting 
rooms and were allowed to ask their children for help. The instrument 
contains about 70 items for which response options are “yes,” 
“no,” or “don’t know.” Instructions focus on behavior at baseline rather 
than recent days if the child may have had an acute illness. A 22-item 
scale identifies polysomnographically defined SDB with sufficient 
validity and reliability for use in clinical research (Chervin et al., 2000). 
The SDB score represents the proportion of symptom items that are 
positive. Responses of “don’t know” are counted as missing data. 
Among 27 sleep laboratory–referred children with demonstrated SDB 
and 54 comparison subjects at a general pediatrics clinic, an SDB 
score >0.33 showed a sensitivity of 0.81 and a specificity of 0.87. 
Subscales for snoring (Table 1, items A2, A3, A4, A5) and excessive 
daytime sleepiness (items B1, B2, B4, B6) each discriminated well 
between the children who had SDB and comparison subjects 
(Chervin et al., 2000). In the present study, the 22-item SDB scale 
was used without 6 daytime behavior items to avoid artificial associations 
with conduct problems. Item A2 asks about habitual snoring 
and was analyzed separately. 

A six-item restless legs and PLMS scale within the Pediatric Sleep 
Questionnaire has adequate validity and reliability for use in clinical 
research (Table 2) (Chervin and Hedger, 2001). The PLMS score is 
calculated similarly to the SDB score, except that double weight is 
assigned to the two most specific symptoms, those of restless legs and

children, a PLMS score > 0.33 demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.79 and 
a specificity of 0.56 for five or more recorded PLMS per hour of sleep 
(Chervin and Hedger, 2001). Internal consistency and test-retest reliability 
were reasonable. In the present study, question A13, about restless 
legs, and question A13b, about growing pains in bed, also were 
analyzed separately. Some analyses controlled for results of one questionnaire 
item (A12) that asks about restless sleep in general, rather 
than restless legs. 

Parents also completed the Conners Parent Rating Scale (CPRS48), 
a commonly used and well-validated 48-item measure of disruptive 
behavior in childhood (Conners and Barkley, 1985). The instrument

CONDUCT PROBLEMS AND SLEEP DISORDERS 

contains an eight-item Conduct Problem Index (CPI) that asks to what 
extent behavior is sassy, resentful, destructive, denying, quarrelsome, 
bullying, fighting, and unhappy. The CPRS-48 also contains a 10-item 
Hyperactivity Index (HI). The CPI and HI show substantial but not 
complete correlation (r = 0.66; Goyette et al., 1978), consistent with 
well-recognized comorbidity between conduct disorder and attentiondeficit/
hyperactivity disorder (Jensen et al., 1997). About half of referred 
children with the latter condition are thought to have conduct disorder 
or oppositional defiant disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 
2000). For both the CPI and the HI, symptoms are rated on a 4-point 
scale, and raw scores are converted to age- and sex-adjusted T scores 
that range from 0 to 100. Normative data derive from a large sample 
of children grouped into 3-year age bins from 3 to 17 years old 
(Goyette et al., 1978). For the current study, normative data from children 
3 to 5 years old also were used to generate T scores for 2-year-old 
subjects. The T scores that exceed the average (50) by 1 SD (10 points) 
or 2 SD (20 points) frequently are considered to represent high levels 
of the behavior. In this study, CPI > 60 and HI > 60 were considered 
to represent a conduct problem and hyperactive behavior, respectively. 
The more sensitive and less specific cut points were chosen to enhance 
power to detect associations of biological interest. Three additional 
items from the CPRS-48 (but not the CPI) were also analyzed separately: 
these asked about stealing, disobedience, and cruelty. Individual 
symptom items were considered positive if parents reported that their 
children were bothered by them “pretty much” or “very much.” 

Analysis 

Behavioral differences between children with and without sleep-
related problems were tested with T, .2, or Fisher exact tests. Logistic 
regression models of CPI > 60 were used to test for associations with 
overall SDB scores (normalized), PLMS scores (normalized), sleepiness 
scores (normalized), and selected individual symptom items. 
Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals were adjusted 
for age and sex. To determine whether an association between SDB 

or PLMS and conduct problems might result from sleepiness, as an 
intermediate variable, the sleepiness scale was used to adjust for this 
factor. A similar approach was used to assess for possible confounding 
from stimulant use (as reported on questionnaires), hyperactive 
behavior (HI), and restless sleep in general (question-item A12). To 
assess for interaction of sleep-related symptoms with age and sex, 
analyses were performed on specific age and sex subgroups. 

Attributable risk percent and population attributable risk percent 
(Hennekens and Buring, 1987) were computed contingent on two key 
assumptions: (1) that habitual snoring or restless legs (or any associated 
sleep disorders) can cause conduct problems (CPI > 60), and (2) that 
the prevalence rates of habitual snoring and restless legs in the general 
pediatric clinic population are those measured in the current study. The 
attributable risk percent then estimates the proportion of sleep-symptom-
positive, conduct-problem-positive general clinic children whose 
behavioral problem could be eliminated by treatment of each sleep problem. 
The population attributable risk percent estimates the proportion 
of all conduct-problem-positive general clinic children whose behavioral 
problem could be eliminated by treatment of each sleep problem. 

RESULTS 

Subjects 

Parents of approximately 1,400 children were approached; 
those of 1,215 (87%) signed informed consent; and those 
of 872 (62%), aged 2.0 to 13.9 years, completed at least 
two thirds of the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire and the 
CPI. Demographic information for the sample is provided 
in Table 3. Little information was available on subjects 
whose parents failed to complete the Pediatric Sleep 
Questionnaire, which was the first instrument adminis-

legs, only 12% [10, 15] had high CPI. 

The associations between CPI > 60 and scores for SDB 
and PLMS retained significance when the two logistic 
regression models were adjusted for sleepiness subscores 
(OR = 1.5 [1.2, 1.9], p = .0008 for normalized SDB score; 
OR = 1.6 [1.3, 2.0], p < .0001 for normalized PLMS 
score). The strength and significance of these associations 
also showed essentially no change when analyses were 
confined to boys, girls, children at or below 8 years old, 
or children more than 8 years old. 

The attributable risk percent for habitual snoring and 
CPI > 60 was 45%, and the population attributable risk 
percent was 11%. The attributable risk percent for restless 
legs and CPI > 60 was 56%, and the population attributable 
risk percent was 18%. 

Adjustment for Potential Confounding Factors 

The well-known comorbidity of SDB and PLMS 
(Chervin, 2001; Chervin and Archbold, 2001) was reflected 
by the correlation between scores for each condition 
(Spearman correlation coefficient . = 0.43, p < .0001). 
This correlation also reflects the fact that the SDB and 
PLMS scales share two items (B1 and B7). However, a 

multiple logistic regression of CPI > 60 on both scores 
as explanatory variables (controlling for age and sex) 
showed that independent associations with CPI remained 
significant (OR = 1.4 [1.2, 1.7], p = .0005 for SDB score; 
OR = 1.6 [1.3, 1.9], p < .0001 for PLMS score). 

As expected, hyperactive behavior (HI > 60) was strongly 
associated with conduct problems (CPI > 60, .2 = 265, 
p < .0001). However, adjustment of Table 6 models for 
hyperactivity (HI > 60) still showed significant associations 
between high CPI and all variables except for two: 
habitual snoring (OR = 1.4 [0.8, 2.5], p = .27) and growing 
pains (OR = 1.8 [0.8, 4.1], p = .14). Parents reported 
that 30 (3.4%) of the children currently took stimulant 
medication, but adjustment for stimulant use did not alter 
substantially any of the associations listed in Table 6. 

The relatively nonspecific parental report of “restless 
sleep” was associated with higher PLMS scores, restless 
legs, and growing pains (logistic regression and .2 tests 
all p < .01). However, after adjustment of the last three 
models in Table 6 for “restless sleep,” CPI still showed 
significant independent associations with PLMS score 
(OR = 1.7 [1.4, 2.1], p < .0001) and growing pains 
(OR = 2.0 [1.0, 3.8], p = .04), and a trend toward association 
with restless legs (OR = 1.6 [0.9, 2.7], p = .10).

DISCUSSION 

This study of children at two general pediatrics clinics 
shows associations between parent-reported conduct 
problems and symptoms of two childhood sleep disorders, 
SDB and restless legs syndrome. Excessive daytime 
sleepiness, which can occur with any sleep disorder, also 
was associated with conduct problems. The magnitudes 
of these associations were not small: for example, children 
at high risk for SDB, in comparison with remaining children, 
were two to three times more likely to be bullies, 
constant fighters, sassy to adults, destructive, quarrelsome, 
disobedient, and cruel. The association between each type 
of sleep disorder and conduct was dose-dependent and 
retained significance after adjustment for hyperactive 
behavior, stimulant use, a less specific complaint of restless 
sleep, or comorbidity between SDB and PLMS. This 
survey has several limitations that must be taken into 
account in interpretation of results. However, the excess 
frequency of sleep symptoms among children with conduct 
problems suggests that if sleep disorders do affect 
daytime behavior, identification and treatment of sleep 
disorders may offer important opportunities to modify 
behavior in a substantial minority of aggressive children. 

Hyperactive and aggressive behavior show considerable 
overlap in children (Jensen et al., 1997; Weller et al., 
1999), and previous case series of children with SDB have 
suggested that inattentive, hyperactive, and aggressive 
behavior are all important comorbidities of this sleep disorder 
(Guilleminault et al., 1981). Hyperactivity, but not 
aggressive behavior or conduct disorder, has featured 
prominently in previous reports about childhood restless 
legs syndrome and PLMS (Picchietti and Walters, 1999; 
Picchietti et al., 1998). The current study is the first, to 
the authors’ knowledge, to address the converse question 
of whether SDB and restless legs, often undiagnosed in 
children, may occur at elevated frequencies among the 
large number of children with conduct problems. Our 
unambiguous results highlight the importance of another 
question: Do sleep disorders cause or contribute to conduct 
problems in some children? The apparent dose-
response relationships identified in our cross-sectional 
data support, but cannot prove, an affirmative answer. 

Limited evidence that sleep disorders may contribute 
to hyperactive behavior derives from nonrandomized, 
nonblinded studies in which treatment for SDB 
(Guilleminault et al., 1982) or restless legs and PLMS 
(Walters et al., 2000) improved behavior. One study with 

a quasi-experimental design showed that parent- but not 
teacher-rated aggression improved after childhood SDB 
was treated by tonsillectomy (Ali et al., 1996). Heritable 
components of aggressive, antisocial behavior have been 
recognized in the past (Bohman, 1996), and sleep disorders 
could constitute some of these genetic risk factors. 
Studies of SDB suggest a prominent heritable factor 
(Guilleminault et al., 1995; Redline et al., 1995). Childhood 
restless legs syndrome and PLMS are also familial in many 
cases (Picchietti and Walters, 1999). 

Several possible mechanisms could explain an effect of 
sleep disorders on daytime behavior. Excessive daytime 
sleepiness is common to many different sleep disorders 
and could mediate effects on behavior. Hyperactive children 
tend to be sleepier than other children (Chervin 
et al., 2002a; Lecendreux et al., 2000), and some electrophysiological 
evidence suggests that aggressive individuals 
have decreased arousal levels at rest (Houston and 
Stanford, 2001). Pathologically sleepy children still may 
have strong drives to stay awake at ages during which 
learning is critical, and stimulus-seeking behavior may 
be the result. Consequences of inadequate sleep or sleepiness 
may include impaired executive functioning, regulation 
of impulsivity, and control of emotions (Dahl, 
1996), all of which could facilitate aggressive behavior 
(Giancola et al., 1998; Halperin et al., 1995; Oosterlaan 
and Sergeant, 1996; Rebok et al., 1996; ). These cognitive 
processes normally are mediated, at least in part, by 
the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Preliminary data from 
functional imaging studies of adults with SDB suggest 
decreased activity in this brain region and improvement 
after treatment (Thomas et al., 2001). 

Despite the attractiveness of the hypothesis that sleepiness 
might mediate an effect of sleep disorders on daytime 
behavior, the associations we identified between 
conduct and sleep-related symptoms were not greatly 
diminished when a questionnaire subscale for sleepiness 
was taken into account. Another potential intermediate 
variable between sleep disorders and aggression, though 
not assessed in the current research, is affective disorder. 
Disruptive behaviors may be common in children with 
affective disorder (Puig-Antich, 1982), a condition with 
important relationships to sleep. 

Behavior and underlying cognitive processes also could 
be affected by recurrent hypoxemia associated with SDB. 
Exposure of young rats to intermittent hypoxemia during 
sleep causes measurable behavioral changes along with 
neocortical and hippocampal apoptosis (Gozal et al., 


J. AM. ACAD. CHILD ADOLESC. PSYCHIATRY, 42:2, FEBRUARY 2003 

CONDUCT PROBLEMS AND SLEEP DISORDERS 

2001a). Furthermore, apoptosis occurs during a window 
of vulnerability—primarily between 10 and 25 days after 
birth in rats—that could have an analogy in young children 
with SDB (Gozal et al., 2001b). The frequency of 
bullying in children peaks at about age 7 and declines 
thereafter (Olweus, 1993), along a time course only slightly 
delayed from that of adenotonsillar hypertrophy, the most 
common cause of SDB in children. 

Limitations 

The current study is limited by its measures and cross-
sectional design, which allowed examination of an important 
association in a large number of subjects, at the expense 
of diagnostic precision and ability to address underlying 
mechanisms. The Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire is validated 
as a useful research tool for SDB (Chervin et al., 
2000), PLMS (Chervin and Hedger, 2001), and sleepiness 
(Chervin et al., 2000), but it cannot replace sleep laboratory 
measures of each phenomenon. Although validity data 
failed to demonstrate differential function within the age 
range included in the current study, the breadth of that 
range is likely to encompass children whose sleep and behavior 
problems have important differences. The CPRS-48 is 
well validated and widely used, but it is not designed to 
identify DSM-IV–defined conduct disorder and it does 
not include clinical features such as the chronicity of behavior 
or reports from multiple observers. Not all potential 
subjects for this study consented and completed all questionnaires, 
and we could characterize only a portion of 
nonparticipants. Therefore, results may have been subject 
to some selection bias. Although subjects with more than 
one-third missing data on questionnaires were excluded, 
residual effects of missing responses, “don’t know” responses, 
or potential specific combinations of missing data remain 
unknown. Our analyses of associations between sleep symptoms 
and aggression were not the primary prospective aim 
of the research protocol, and our findings merit verification. 
Longitudinal clinical trials will be required to determine 
whether gold-standard measures of sleep and psychiatric 
pathology confirm the associations we have identified and 
whether these associations arise because sleep disorders 
contribute to aggressive behavior or because important 
covariates were omitted. For example, one unstudied covariate 
that deserves further study is posttraumatic stress disorder, 
which is know to be common in adolescents with 
conduct disorder (Reebye et al., 2000) and to be associated 
with sleep disturbances (Ohayon and Shapiro, 2000). 

Clinical Implications 

If future studies do support a causal role for sleep disorders 
in some children with conduct problems, the current 
data suggest a potentially important impact on public 
health: 11% of general pediatric clinic patients with conduct 
problems could benefit if their habitual snoring and 
any underlying SDB were addressed, and 18% could benefit 
if their restless legs and underlying PLMS were addressed. 
Aggression among children is a highly prevalent problem, 
as are sleep deprivation and some primary sleep disorders. 
However, potential sleep disorders are seldom discussed at 
general pediatrics office visits, perhaps in part because sleep 
medicine occupies only a minute fraction of pediatric residency 
training curricula (Chervin et al., 2001; Mindell 
et al., 1994). Increased efforts to teach physicians, other 
clinicians, and parents about childhood sleep disorders 
should be a high priority, especially if their recognition and 
treatment offers a new strategy to address some of the most 
common behavioral challenges in this age group.
