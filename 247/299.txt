Background: 
Children 
with 
asthma 
are 
at 
increased 
risk 
for 
obstructive 
breathing 
during 
sleep. 
Adenotonsillectomy, 
the 
treatment 
of 
choice 
for 
obstructive 
breathing 
during 
sleep, 
is 
associated 
with 
significant 
postoperative 
respiratory 
morbidity. 


Objective: 
To 
determine 
whether 
asthma 
is 
a 
risk 
factor 
for 
respiratory 
complications 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
in 
children 
with 
obstructive 
breathing 
during 
sleep. 


Methods: 
This 
case-control 
study 
compared 
115 
children 
aged 
3 
to 
18 
years 
with 
respiratory 
complications 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
(study 
group) 
with 
115 
children 
without 
respiratory 
complications 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
(control 
group). 


Results: 
The 
postoperative 
respiratory 
complications 
ranged 
from 
oxygen 
desaturation 
to 
respiratory 
failure 
that 
required 
mechanical 
ventilation. 
The 
study 
group 
had 
a 
higher 
proportion 
of 
children 
with 
asthma 
(P 
. 
.01). 
Logistic 
regression 
analysis 
showed 
that 
asthma 
increases 
the 
odds 
of 
postoperative 
respiratory 
complications 
to 
4.4 
(95% 
confidence 
interval, 
2.13–9.0), 
after 
controlling 
for 
age, 
weight 
greater 
than 
the 
97th 
percentile 
for 
age, 
sex, 
race, 
and 
medical 
conditions 
other 
than 
asthma. 


Conclusions: 
In 
children 
with 
obstructive 
breathing 
during 
sleep, 
the 
presence 
of 
asthma 
is 
associated 
with 
an 
increased 
risk 


of 
respiratory 
complications 
after 
adenotonsillectomy. 


INTRODUCTION 


The 
prevalence 
of 
childhood 
asthma 
is 
increasing 
significantly 
in 
the 
United 
States.1 
Children 
with 
asthma 
are 
reported 
to 
be 
at 
an 
increased 
risk 
for 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
compared 
with 
children 
without 
asthma.2,3 
Hence, 
asthma 
is 
a 
common 
comorbid 
condition 
in 
children 
who 
undergo 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
obstructive 
breathing 
during 
sleep. 
Unfortunately, 
postoperative 
respiratory 
complications 
occur 
in 
20% 
to 
25% 
of 
children 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
(OSA) 
who 
undergo 
adenotonsillectomy.
4–8 
The 
effect 
of 
asthma 
on 
these 
complications, 
which 
range 
from 
oxygen 
desaturation 
to 
respiratory 
failure 
that 
requires 
mechanical 
ventilation, 
is 
not 
clear. 
We 
speculate 
that 
with 
increased 
prevalence, 
asthma 
might 
represent 
a 
new 
risk 
factor 
for 
postoperative 
respiratory 
complications 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
obstructive 
breathing 
during 
sleep. 
To 
our 
knowledge, 
lower 
airway 
obstruction, 
manifest 
as 
asthma, 
has 
not 
been 
studied 
as 
an 
independent 
risk 
factor 
for 
respiratory 
complications 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
obstructive 
breathing 
during 
sleep 
in 
children. 
Obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
syndrome 
has 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
clinical 
presentation, 
with 
OSA 
on 
the 
severe 
end 
of 
the 
spectrum. 
Snoring 
and 
difficulty 
breathing 
during 
sleep 
are 
the 
most 
common 
complaints 
in 
children 
with 
OSA 
syndrome. 
A 
survey 
of 
current 
otolaryngology 
practice 
patterns 
in 
the 
United 
States 
reported

as 
the 
most 
used

Thus, 
preoperative 
testing 
for 
OSA 
is 
limited 
to 
a 
few 
specialized 
centers. 
Cincinnati 
Children’s 
Hospital 
serves 
as 
the 
tertiary 
hospital 
for 
the 
region 
and 
as 
the 
community 
hospital 
for 
children 
in 
the 
city 
of 
Cincinnati. 
We 
hypothesized 
that 
children 
who 
develop 
respiratory 
complications 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
obstructive 
breathing 
during 
sleep 
have 
a 
higher 
prevalence 
of 
asthma 
than 
those 
who 
do 
not 
develop 
postoperative 
respiratory 
complications. 


METHODS 


Study 
Design 


All 
children 
who 
underwent 
adenoidectomy, 
tonsillectomy, 
or 
both 
at 
Cincinnati 
Children’s 
Hospital 
or 
its 
satellites 
between 
June 
1, 
1999, 
and 
May 
31, 
2001, 
were 
identified 
from 
the 
medical 
records 
database. 
A 
search 
was 
performed 
using 
Current 
Procedural 
Terminology 
codes 
to 
determine 
the 
type 
of 
surgery 
and 
International 
Classification 
of 
Diseases 
diagnosis 
codes 
to 
determine 
the 
indication 
for 
surgery. 
Thus, 
we 
distinguished 
between 
children 
who 
underwent 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
obstructive 
breathing 
during 
sleep 
and 
those 
who 
underwent 
this 
procedure 
for 
recurrent 
otitis 
or 
tonsillitis. 
We 
did 
not 
include 
children 
younger 
than 
3 
years 
in 
this 
analysis 
because 
of 
the 
high 
prevalence 
of 
bronchiolitis 
at 
this 
age, 
which 
can 
be 
mistakenly 
diagnosed 
as 
asthma. 
A 
retrospective 
medical 
record 
review 
was 
undertaken 
to 
describe 
the 
children 
who 
met 
the 
inclusion 
criteria. 
The 
study 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
institutional 
review 
board 
at 
Cincinnati 
Children’s 
Hospital. 


The 
presence 
of 
obstructive 
breathing 
was 
determined 
by 
a 
history 
of 
snoring 
and 
the 
presence 
of 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy 
on 
examination 
by 
an 
otolaryngologist.

for 
a 
list 
of 
comorbid

asthma. 
The 
study

consisted 
of 
115 
children 
with 
respiratory 
complications 
after

for 
obstructive

who 
underwent 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
obstructive 
breathing 
during 
sleep 
on 
the 
same 
date 
as 
the 
study 
group 
but 
who 
did 
not 
develop 
postoperative 
respiratory 
complications. 
We 
attempted 
to

practice 
styles 
and 
the 
effect 
of 
seasonal 
variation 
on

of

conditions 
by 
choosing 
controls 
from 
the 
same

The 
exclusion 
criteria 
consisted 
of 
recurrent

as 
an 
indication 
for 
adenotonsillectomy, 
no 
report 
of 
snoring 
on 
the

Respiratory 
Complications 


Respiratory 
complications 
were 
defined 
as 
any 
of 
the 
following: 
oxygen 
desaturation 
less 
than 
90% 
that 
required 
oxygen 
supplementation 
for 
more 
than 
8 
hours 
or 
diuretics; 
apnea 
or 
increased 
work 
of 
breathing 
that 
required 
nasopharyngeal 
airway 
support, 
continuous 
positive 
airway 
pressure, 
or 
intubation 
and 
mechanical 
ventilation; 
and 
chest 
radiographic 
evidence 
of 
atelectasis, 
infiltrate, 
edema, 
and 
air/fluid 
collection 
in 
the 
pleural

Subset 
Analysis 


Among 
children 
selected 
for 
the 
study, 
a 
subset 
of 
64 
children 
was 
selected 
to 
examine 
the 
association 
of 
asthma 
with 
postoperative 
respiratory 
complications, 
after 
eliminating 
the 
effect 
of 
comorbid 
conditions 
other 
than 
asthma. 
Children 
with 
either 
no 
comorbid 
conditions 
or 
asthma 
as 
the 
only 
comorbid 
condition 
were 
included 
in 
this 
subset; 
children 
with 
comorbid 
conditions 
other 
than 
asthma 
were 
excluded. 


Statistical 
Analysis 


The 
analyses 
were 
performed 
using 
a 
statistical 
software 
program 
(SAS

In 
all

was 
considered 
significant. 
Two-sample 
t 
tests 
were 
used 
to 
detect 
differences 
in 
the 
mean 
values 
for 
age 
and 
weight 
between 
groups.

Tests 
were 
used 
to 
detect 
differences 
in 
the 
sex, 
race, 
and 
comorbid 
conditions 
between 
groups. 
Logistic 
regression 
analysis 
was 
used 
to 
select 
a 
model 
that 
predicts 
risk 
of 
postoperative 
respiratory 
complications. 
Variables 
that 
were 
significant 
by 
univariate 
analysis 
were 
included 
in 
the 
model. 
Weight 
was 
forced 
into 
the 
model 
even 
though 
it 
did 
not 
meet 
statistical 
significance 
given 
the 
biological 
significance 
of 
this 
variable. 


RESULTS 


A 
total 
of 
5,488 
patients 
underwent 
tonsillectomy, 
adenoidectomy, 
or 
both 
at 
Cincinnati 
Children’s 
Hospital 
between 
June 
1, 
1999, 
and 
May 
31, 
2001. 
Obstructive 
breathing 
dur


ing 
sleep 
was 
the 
indication 
in 
3,739 
children 
(68%); 
198 
(5%) 
of 
these 
children 
developed 
postoperative 
respiratory 
complications 
that 
required 
intervention. 
One 
hundred 
fifteen 
children 
aged 
3 
to 
18 
years 
who 
underwent 
adenotonsillectomy 
only 
constituted 
the 
study 
group. 
An 
equal 
number 
of 
children 
(n 
. 
115) 
with 
obstructive 
breathing 
during 
sleep 
who 
underwent 
the 
same 
procedure 
as 
the 
study 
group 
served 
as 
controls. 
The 
2 
groups 
differed 
in 
age 
but 
not 
in 
weight 
or 
sex 
(Table 
1). 
A 
significant 
difference 
between 
the 
2 
groups 
was 
observed 
in 
the 
total 
number 
of 
African 
American 
children 
(P 
. 
.01) 
(Table 
1), 
children 
with 
asthma 
(P

and 
children 
with 
weight 
greater 
than 
the 
97th 
percentile 
(P 
. 
.03) 
(Table 
2). 
Asthma 
was 
the 
most 
common 
comorbid 
condition 
in 
the 
study 
group 
(Table 
2). 
The 
presence 
of 
asthma 
was 
a 
significant 
predictor 
of 
postoperative 
respiratory 
complications 
(odds 
ratio 
[OR], 
4.4; 
95% 
confidence 
interval 
[CI], 
2.13–9.0) 
in 
a 
model 
that 
controlled 
for 
sex, 
race, 
and 
all 
medical 
conditions 
other 
than 
asthma 
(Table 
3). 
Age 
and 
weight 
greater 
than 
the 
97th 
percentile 
for 
age 
did 
not 
meet 
the 
criterion 
(P 
. 
.05) 
for 
inclusion 
in 
the 
model. 
Asthma 
remained 
a 
significant 
predictor 
when 
weight 
was 
considered 
as 
a 
continuous 
variable. 
To 
evaluate 
the 
independent 
effect 
of 
asthma, 
we 
analyzed 
a 
subset 
of 
64 
children 
from 
the 
study 
group 
with 
no 
other 
comorbid 
conditions. 
This 
group 
was 
compared 
with 
all 
children 
from 
the 
control 
group 
with 
asthma 
as 
the 
only 
comorbid 
condition 
(n 
. 
111). 
The 
subset 
study 
group 
had 
a 
higher 
proportion 
of 
children 
with 
asthma 
(P 
. 
.01), 
and 
asthma 
was 
associated 
with 
the 
occurrence 
of 
postoperative 
respiratory 
complications 
after 
controlling 
for 
age, 
sex, 
weight 
greater 
than 
the 
97th 
percentile, 
and 
African 
American 
race 
(OR, 
3.3; 
95% 
CI, 
1.33–7.1). 


All 
115 
children 
in 
the 
study 
group 
had 
oxygen 
desaturation 
that 
required 
supplementation 
for 
8 
hours 
to 
4 
days, 
33 
children 
required 
nasal 
airway 
support, 
14 
were 
receiving 
continuous 
positive 
airway 
pressure 
support, 
and 
9 
children 
required 
intubation 
and 
mechanical 
ventilation. 
Of 
29 
chest 
radiographs 
performed 
for 
clinical 
management 
in 
children 
in 
the 
study 
group, 
5 
(17%) 
showed 
no 
abnormalities, 
10 
(34%) 
showed 
air

10 
(34%) 
showed 
pulmonary

DISCUSSION 


In 
this

Asthma 
is 
characterized 
by 
lower 
airway 
obstruction 
secondary 
to 
mucosal 
inflammation 
and 
bronchospasm. 
Under 
general 
anesthesia, 
altered 
chest 
wall 
mechanics 
result 
in 
low 
lung 
volumes 
and 
increased 
lower 
airway 
resistance.10 
Also, 
asthma 
is 
associated 
with 
impaired 
mucociliary 
clearance 
secondary 
to 
chronic 
inflammation. 
This 
makes 
children 
with 
asthma 
more 
susceptible 
to 
atelectasis 
and 
secondarily 
to 
pneumonitis 
in 
the 
immediate 
postoperative 
period, 
which 
would 
present 
as 
chest 
radiographic 
findings 
of 
air

disease. 


Postoperative 
pulmonary 
edema 
has 
been 
reported 
in 
children 
who 
undergo 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
obstructive 
breathing 
during 
sleep.11,12 
The 
cause 
of 
pulmonary 
edema 
in 
this 
group 
of 
patients 
can 
be 
classified 
into 
cardiogenic 
and 
noncardiogenic 
groups. 
Several 
mechanisms 
have 
been 
proposed 
for 
noncardiogenic 
pulmonary 
edema. 
It 
is 
believed 
that 
children 
with 
obstructive 
breathing 
during 
sleep 
have 
increased 
peak 
end 
expiratory 
pressure, 
which 
prevents 
movement 
of 
fluid 
from 
pulmonary 
vessels 
into 
the 
alveoli. 
The 
sudden 
relief 
of 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
after 
surgery 
leads 
to 
a 
loss 
of 
peak 
end 
expiratory 
pressure, 
resulting 
in 
pulmonary 
edema. 
Also, 
general 
anesthesia, 
because 
of 
its 
effect 
on 
pulmonary 
compliance 
and 
increased 
risk 
of 
aspiration, 
may 
have 
a 
potential 
role. 
Our 
understanding 
of 
cardiogenic 
pulmonary 
edema 
has 
been 
limited 
by 
previous 
studies 
of 
OSA 
in 
children 
primarily 
affecting 
the 
right 
heart 
chambers. 
Recently, 
it 
has 
been 
shown 
that 
OSA 
in 
children 
is 
associated 
with 
left 
ventricular 
hypertrophy.13 
The 
presence 
of 
asthma 
in 
this 
group 
of 
patients 
can 
contribute 
to 
the 
severity 
of 
left 
ventricular 
hypertrophy 
by 
several 
mechanisms. 
Patients 
with 
asthma 
have 
an 
exaggerated 
increase 
in 
their 
airway 
resistance 
during 
sleep 
relative 
to 
wakefulness.14 
Poorly 
con


trolled 
asthma 
could 
increase 
hypoxia 
and 
hypoventilation 
in 
children 
with 
OSA. 
Also, 
children 
with 
asthma 
have 
a 
higher 
prevalence 
of 
obesity,15–19 
which 
by 
itself 
can 
contribute 
to 
left 
ventricular 
hypertrophy.20 
Left 
ventricular 
hypertrophy 
is 
associated 
with 
abnormal 
left 
ventricular 
diastolic 
function. 
General 
anesthesia 
has 
a 
dose-dependent 
depressant 
effect 
on 
myocardial 
contractility,21 
with 
a 
greater 
depression 
of 
hypertrophied 
myocardium.22 
It 
remains 
to 
be 
investigated 
whether 
left 
ventricular 
hypertrophy 
that 
leads 
to 
diastolic 
dysfunction, 
with 
further 
decompensation 
under 
anesthesia, 
is 
the 
mechanism 
for 
pulmonary 
edema 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
in 
children 
with 
OSA. 
This 
could 
explain 
the 
increased 
prevalence 
of 
respiratory 
complications 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
in 
children 
with 
obstructive 
breathing 
during 
sleep 
and 
asthma. 


We 
report 
an 
increased 
risk 
of 
respiratory 
complications 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
in 
African 
American 
children 
(OR, 
5.3; 
95% 
CI, 
2.5–10.9). 
This 
result 
is 
similar 
to 
that 
reported 
in 
the 
literature.4–6 
In 
our 
data, 
the 
effect 
of 
African 
American 
race 
is 
not 
significantly 
affected 
by 
controlling 
for 
a 
history 
of 
asthma 
or 
for 
weight 
greater 
than 
the 
97th 
percentile 
for 
age. 
It 
is 
likely 
that 
there 
is 
a 
yet 
unknown 
genetic 
predisposition 
that 
was 
not 
investigated 
in 
this 
study. 
The 
strongest 
association 
of 
respiratory 
complications 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
with 
the 
variable 
“all 
comorbid 
conditions 
other 
than 
asthma” 
is 
not 
surprising 
given 
that 
this 
variable 
is 
a 
group 
of 
several 
medical 
conditions, 
all 
of 
them 
already 
previously 
identified 
as 
risk 
factors 
for 
postoperative 
respiratory 
complications.
4,6–8 
The 
goal 
of 
this 
study 
was 
to 
determine 
the 
independent 
contribution 
of 
asthma 
to 
the 
development 
of 
postoperative 
respiratory 
complications. 
Hence, 
we 
controlled 
for 
the 
effects 
of 
“all 
comorbid 
conditions 
other 
than 
asthma” 
on 
our 
results 
by 
including 
them 
in 
the 
regression 
analyses. 
In 
addition, 
the 
small 
number 
of 
individual 
diagnoses 
would 
preclude 
the 
application 
of 
inferential 
statistics. 


In 
the 
present 
study, 
the 
prevalence 
of 
respiratory 
complications 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
in 
children 
with 
obstructive 
breathing 
during 
sleep, 
for 
2 
years, 
was 
5.3% 
for 
children 
aged 
3 
to 
18 
years. 
This 
is 
lower 
than 
the 
20% 
to 
25% 
prevalence 
of 
postoperative 
respiratory 
complications 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
reported 
for 
children 
with 
OSA 
proved 
by 
polysomnography.4,8 
We 
used 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy 
as 
an 
indication 
for 
adenotosillectomy 
to 
identify 
children 
with 
sleep-disordered 
breathing. 
Children 
in 
the 
study 
and 
control 
groups 
also 
had 
a 
parent 
report 
of 
snoring 
with 
or 
without 
respiratory 
pauses, 
which 
may 
have 
led 
to 
the 
inclusion 
of 
children 
on 
the 
milder 
end 
of 
the 
spectrum 
of 
sleep-
disordered 
breathing. 
However, 
this 
reflects 
the 
current 
standards 
of 
practice 
at 
most 
medical 
centers 
in 
the 
United 
States 
because 
of 
a 
limited 
number 
of 
pediatric 
sleep 
facilities 
and 
the 
expense 
of 
performing 
polysomnograms 
before 
adenotonsillectomy. 
Also, 
Cincinnati 
Children’s 
Hospital 
serves 
as 
the 
community 
hospital 
for 
children 
in 
the 
city 
of 
Cincinnati 
and 
as 
the 
tertiary 
care 
facility 
for 
the 
greater 
Cincinnati 
area, 
comprising 
several 
counties. 
The 
incidence 
of 
postoperative 
respiratory 
complications 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
in 
the 
general 
pediatric 
population 
is 
1.3%.23 
Thus, 
differences 
in 


VOLUME 
94, 
MAY, 
2005 



referral 
patterns, 
study 
populations, 
and 
diagnostic 
criteria 
for 
OSA 
syndrome 
may 
have 
contributed 
to 
the 
lower 
incidence 
of 
postoperative 
respiratory 
complications 
in 
this 
study. 
This 
prevalence 
of 
5.3% 
was, 
however, 
higher 
than 
the 
report 
of 
postoperative 
respiratory 
complications 
in 
patients 
with 
asthma 
alone.24 
Future 
studies 
should 
examine 
the 
potential 
interaction 
between 
upper 
and 
lower 
airway 
obstruction 
in 
the 
causation 
of 
postoperative 
respiratory 
morbidity. 


There 
are 
some 
limitations 
to 
this 
study. 
We 
do 
not 
have 
data 
on 
the 
severity 
of 
obstructive 
breathing 
during 
sleep. 
Hence, 
we 
cannot 
assure 
ourselves 
that 
the 
2 
groups 
are 
matched 
for 
severity 
of 
obstructive 
breathing 
during 
sleep. 
However, 
the 
prevalence 
of 
asthma 
is 
different 
in 
the 
2 
groups, 
and 
this 
cannot 
be 
accounted 
for 
by 
the 
unequal 
distribution 
of 
the 
severity 
of 
obstructive 
breathing 
during 
sleep 
in 
the 
2 
groups. 
Another 
limitation 
of 
this 
study 
is 
the 
lack 
of 
confirmation 
of 
the 
asthma 
diagnosis 
by 
pulmonary 
function 
testing. 


CONCLUSION 


This 
study 
reveals 
an 
association 
between 
the 
presence 
of 
asthma 
and 
the 
occurrence 
of 
respiratory 
complications 
after 
adenotonsillectomy, 
after 
controlling 
for 
age, 
sex, 
weight 
greater 
than 
the 
97th 
percentile 
for 
age, 
race, 
and 
medical 
conditions 
other 
than 
asthma. 
The 
recognition 
of 
asthma, 
a 
common 
childhood 
disease, 
as 
a 
risk 
factor 
for 
respiratory 
complications 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
is 
important 
in 
understanding 
the 
mechanisms 
of 
postoperative 
respiratory 
complications 
in 
children 
with 
obstructive 
breathing 
during 
sleep 
and 
in 
providing 
care 
for 
children 
who 
undergo 
adenotonsillectomy.
