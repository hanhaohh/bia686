Introduction 
Snoring is common among children as well as adults 
andasignofsleepdisordered breathing(SDB).Usually 
the snoring has been addressed as related to the 
natural development of the Waldeyer’s ring, which 
developsfrombirthand reachesamaximumataround 
5yearsofage[2].Thisnaturalhyperplasia causedby 
antigen exposure and infections of the adenoidtissue 
and the palatine tonsils diminishes the volume ofthe 
upper respiratory tract in preschool children during 
their immunological development. Especially in anatomically 
narrowindividuals, this may resultin snoring 
and SDB [3].Pharyngeal obstruction may resultin 
oralbreathingandisoften associatedwithadifferent 
craniofacial development, the ‘‘long facesyndrome’’ 
[4—6].Snoring, restless sleep and enuresis are commonsymptoms,
butsleep apneaisrare as thattermis 
definedfor adults. The policies followed in deciding 
whether and how to treat snoring children vary in 
different countries and over time [7,8]. Some clinicians 
advocate thatitisoften besttowaitand expect 
that the natural involution of excessive tissue will 
ameliorate the symptoms. On the contrary, recent 
investigations stress not only the impact of sleep 
apnea, but even of habitual snoring on the general 
health and development of the child [9—12]. 

In a previous publication, we have reported the 
symptoms and prevalence of snoring and SDB and 
the anatomical aberration connected to the condition,
inacohortof4 yearold children [1].Twentyeight 
of the 48 children with indication of SDB were 
thereafter operated withtonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy 
within the following year. 

The present investigation is a follow-up of the 
earlier studied cohort of children at the age of 6 
with the aim to elucidate the natural development 
of snoring and related symptoms in the cohort and to 
evaluate the effect of surgery for those childrenwho 
were operated for their SDB. 

The Ethical Committee at Uppsala University 
approved the study and informed consent was 
obtained from all the parents. 

2. 
Subjects 
and 
method 
The original cohort consisted of all 4 year old children 
living in a small community in central Sweden 
(644). Six hundred and fifteen participated in the 
initial study [1]. 

2.1. 
The 
initial 
study 
When the children were 4 years old, their parents 
were asked by mail to complete a questionnaire 

about their sleeping habits, snoring, apneas, oral 
breathing, bedwetting and sucking habits and throat 
infections.Parents were also asked if the child had 
been operated earlier and whether the parents 
themselves had undergone an adenoidectomy or 
tonsillectomy in their childhood. For questions 
and responses, see Table 1. 

All children who were reported to ‘‘snore every 
night’’ and/or ‘‘have apneas in connection to snoring’’
were examinedbyaphysician andwere offered 
a sleep study in the ward: oxymetry, sleeping position, 
thermistors at the nose and mouth and an 
electrostatic mattress (Eden trace II, Nellcor Europe´ 
BV,The Netherlands)(Fig.1). These children also 
had an orthodontic examination including lateral 
cephalograms. Impressions for plaster cast were 
taken from these children as well as from healthy 
controls in the cohort [1]. In the cases where SDB 
was diagnosed — defined as registered snoring most 
of the night withstrained breathing, and with a few 
or many apneas [1] — surgery was recommended and 
subsequently performed with adenoidectomy and/ 
or tonsillectomy depending on the result of the 
clinicalexamination. Within6months after surgery, 
the children who were operated(n 
= 28) were given 
a follow-up examination by a physician. 

2.2. 
Two 
year 
follow-up 
In the present study, when the children were6year 
old, the same questionnaire was again mailed to the 
parents. Children who at this time reported ‘‘snoring 
every night’’ and/or ‘‘sleep apnea’’ were examined 
by an orthodontist (BLT)and dental casts were 
made from the operated children, from the non-
snoring controls, and from all new ‘‘cases’’. Cephalograms 
were taken of the operated children and of

the new cases. The biometric results were compared 
with the baseline. These children were later 
examined by an otorhinlaryngologist and treated 
according to clinical praxis.

Statistics 
Epi-Info was used for statistical analysis. This program 
was developed by the American CDC and by 
WHO and is used extensively in epidemiological 
research. Descriptive statistics were calculated 
and stratified analyses were done in 2 . 
2 tables. 
The significance level p 
< 
0.05 was chosen. 

3. 
Results 
Six hundred and fifteen children participated at the 
age of 4 and 509 of them (83%), 249 boys and 260 
girls, at the age of 6. 

3.1. 
Questionnaires: 
The questions and answers to the questionnaire at 
both4and6years(n 
= 509) are presentedin Table1. 

The prevalence of snoring for the total group had 
decreased from 53 to 46%( p 
< 
0.05). 

There werenosignificantdifferencesbetweenthe 
measurementstakenat6yearsfrom those takenat4 
years on restless sleep or oral breathing for the total 
group, but thereweresignificant gender differences: 
girls at both4and6 more often had ongoing sucking 
habits( p 
< 
0.001),boysonlyatage4moreoftenhad 
enuresis. Both suckingand enuresis had decreasedby 
age6 for boysas well as for girls(p 
< 
0.01). 

3.2. 
Snoring 
every 
night 
(SEN) 
The proportion of children snoring every night had 
decreased from 6.9% at age4 to 5.3% at age6 (not 
significant). The answers on the questionnaire for 
these SEN children differed in many respects from 
those for the non-snoring children (NS), both at age 
4 and age 6: restless sleep every night was more 
frequent, 54% versus 2.1% at 4 (p 
< 
0.001) and 
25.9% versus 2.2% at the age of6( p 
< 
0.001). At 
4 years, 57% of the SEN children were reported to 
have previously had tonsillitis compared to 28% of 
theNSchildren.At6yearsold,52%ofSEN versus34% 
of NS children were reported to have had tonsillitis 
within the past2 years( p 
< 
0.05). At the age of 4, 
17% of the SEN children were reported to breathe 
orally compared to 3.3% of the NS children 
(p 
< 
0.001). At the age of 6, oral breathing had 
increased to 37% (SEN) versus 3.6% among the non-
snoring (NS) children( p 
< 
0.001) (see Table 2).

operated children(n= 467). NS, Children not snoring; SS, 
children snoring sometimes; SEN, children snoring every 
night. 


3.3. 
Snoring 
sometimes 
(SS) 
The answers for SS children differed substantially 
from those of the NS children in many respects, both 
amongthe4year oldsandfortheSS childrenatage 
6 (seeTable2). These children were not altogether 
the same (see Fig. 2). 

42.5% of SS children reported restless sleep compared 
to 22.8% of the NS children at 4 years and 
45.4% versus 21.5%, respectively, at 6 years 
(p 
< 
0.001). Oral breathing was reported for 13% 
oftheSS children versus3.6%oftheNSchildrenat6 
years( p 
< 
0.001). Apneas were reported for 3% of 
SS children but none for the NS children at 4 years 
(p 
< 
0.01), and 4.8% and none for the NS children at 
6 years(p 
< 
0.001). 

A history of tonsillitis was reported significantly 
more often among SS children than the NS children: 
at 4 years 36.5% SS reported prior tonsillitis versus 
27.8% NS( p 
< 
0.05)andat6years44.9%SSreported 
prior tonsillitis versus 34.2% NS( p 
< 
0.05). 

3.4. 
Natural 
development 
The natural development of snoring for all not 
operated 
children is shown in Fig. 2.New SEN 
children were recruited, 2 from the NS group and 
11 from the ‘‘snoring sometimes’’ (SS) group. 
Eighty-one children stopped snoring withouttreatment, 
78/214 in the SS group and 3/18 in the SEN 
group. 

Out of the 18/46 who were SEN children at 
age 4 and who were not later operated, seven 
snored everynight andeight snored sometimesby 
age 6. 

3.5. 
Apneas 
For children at age 6, parents reported breathing 
interruptions at night for none of the NS children, 
for 4.8% of the SS children and for 37.0% of the SEN 
children( p 
< 
0.001)(Table 2).

3.6. 
Previous 
surgery 
Twenty-three out of the 509 children had been 
operated for obstructive problems before the age 
of 4, 10 boys and 13 girls. Adenoidectomy had been 
performed for all of them and five had also had a 
tonsillectomy. Of the children who were operated 
earlier,8/23didnot snoreatallattheageof4while 
eight snored every night and of these seven also 
reported apneas (none of these had been tonsillectomized). 
Six of the children operated earlier were 
includedin the ‘‘snoring group’’at the ageof4and 
were reoperated (4/TE and 2/A). 

3.7. 
Surgery 
Twenty-eight of the 48 children with indications of 
SDBattheageof4 were operated beforetheageof 
6, 26 adenoidectomies and 15 tonsillectomies 
(Fig. 3). Twelve out of the 15 children who were 
tonsillectomized had earlier been adenoidectomized. 


At the clinical examination 6 months after surgery, 
most parents reported substantial reductions 
in snoring and sleep disturbance.Two children who 
had been solely adenoidectomized still snored every 
night and were subsequently tonsillectomized. 

Responses regarding snoring for the operated 
children at the age of 6 are presented in Fig. 3. 

Out of the 28 children,4 still snored every night 
and 10 snored ‘‘sometimes’’. 

Two children where A+T was performed still 
reported apneas every night as well as one child 
where onlyAwas performed. Five operated children 
reported apneas sometimes (four adenoidectomized 
and oneA+T). 

3.8. 
Biometric 
assessment 
The craniofacial morphology among the SEN children 
at the age of 4 demonstrated a tendency 
toward ‘‘long face syndrome’’ with a greater

anterior face height, a shorter lower dental arch, 
a narrower upper dental arch. Lateral cross-bite 
was noted more often than among NS children 
(p 
< 
0.05). For further details see [1].Atthe age 
of6, thecraniofacialdevelopmentof the28 operated 
children demonstratedatendencytonormalization,

compared to the children in the control group 
(p

Discussion 
The presentinvestigation is a cohort study with high 
participation rate both at base-line and ata2 year 
follow-up. Since every childwho had been operated 
participated in the follow-up, no special analysis of 
children not answering was regarded as necessary. 

That postoperative sleep-registrations have not 
been performedisa weaknessof the study;the data 
on snoringandapneasat6yearsofagearebasedon 
parental observations of the cohort plus clinical 
examination for the symptomatic and the operated 
children. At the time of the4year study, there was 
no generally accepted definition ofOSA in children, 
and for our study the original diagnosis SDB was 
determined based on measured AHI after a full 
night’s observation in the clinic [1]. At the 6 year 
follow-up, solely parental reports were used. 

Almost all the operated children had an initial 
improvement (‘‘we have gotten a new child’’), but 
after 2 years, half of them had relapsed to varying 
degrees of snoring(Fig.3). This stresses the importance 
of postoperative controls in snoring children 
and of recommendations to the parents that they 
should make new contact if their child starts to 
snore again. 


Development of snoring between 4 and 6 years 

Fig.5(a and b) Diagram illustrating the changes of the 
variable NSL/ML (mandible inclination) between the age 
of4and6(after surgery) for5boys and8girls. Dotted lines 
represent mean values of changes in a normal material. 


The prevalence of snoring every night in the 
cohort had decreased by only 2% at the age of 6 
in spite of surgical interventions of 4.5%. Children 
between the age of 4 and 6 have a developing 
immune system with active growth of the lymphatic 
tissue of the Waldeyer’s ring, related to upper airway 
infections which are abundant during this period 
[13]. This can be observed in the present study 
where the children snoring every night had a history 
of tonsillitis to a much higher degree than the non-
snoring children. Therefore, our data suggests that 
treatment after a community screening for OSA at 
the ageof4 would notbe enough for preventionof 
SDB, since new cases will appear in the cohort for at 

least the coming2years. Nasal allergy and increase 
of weight may also contribute to snoring during 
these years. 

To deal with parents/children who have been 
found through a community cohort study is quite 
different than taking care of children whose parents 
have actively sought help for a problem they experience: 
Many parents in the present study were 
pleased, because theyhad earlier consulted doctors 
who had,as they thought, neglected their children’s 
symptoms and told them that the problems eventually 
would ‘‘grow away’’. Other parents were not 
aware of the possible connection between snoring 
and their children’s behavioral symptoms (bed-wetting, 
restless sleep) [14,15]. Separated parents having 
different opinions often resulted in 
unwillingnesstogo further both withsleep registration 
and later to surgery. These are reasons why such 
a high proportion of the children with reported 
symptoms of SDB were not operated (20/48). 

Some children seem to be more prone to lymphatic 
hypertrophy than others, which is demonstrated 
by the fact that 12 of the children who were diagnosed 
with OSA and afterward tonsillectomizedhad 
already earlier been adenoidectomized due to 
obstruction problems before the age of 4. After a 
period without symptoms, theyhad started to snore 
again. This is in contradiction to studiesdemonstrating 
good long-term effects for a similar age group 
with adenoidectomy alone [20]. 

The children diagnosed with OSA also demonstrated 
craniofacial developmental aberrations at 
the age of 4 [1] which after operation, showed a 
tendency to normalization at the age of 6; the 
mandibular inclination (the angle between the 
lower border of the mandible and the anterior scull 
base) decreased more between age 4 and 6 compared 
to normal values from a sample of British 
children [16] (Figs. 4 and 5a and b). This is in 
agreement with a recent investigation, where partial 
normalization of cephalometric measurements 
occurred after adenotonsillectomy in young children 
[17]. However, the children in our study still 
had narrower upper dental arches, and more often 
lateral cross bites at the follow-up at6years which 
is partly in contradiction to other investigations, 
where a normalization also of the occlusion 
occurred after tonsillectomy [18,19] adeno-tonsillectomy 
[20] and adenoidectomy [21]. One reason 
for the diverging results is that the time span 
between surgery and the second orthodontic examination 
in the present study for some cases was 
too short (less than2years) due to existing waiting 
lists for surgery and personal choices. A renewed 
orthodontic evaluation of these children will be 
performed at the age of 12.

The level of snoring changed in many cases, and 
thus the individual child could belong to different 
snoring-groups at the age of4and6(Fig.2). This is 
not in agreement with an earlier study [22] where 
children with ‘‘primary snoring’’ were checked after 
3years and wereregarded not to have changed their 
status concerning snoring. However some of these 
nine children with a mean RDI of 3.54, would by us, 
today, have been classified as having SDB. Clear 
differences in several sleep variables could also 
be seen compared to their control children without 
any snoring. 

The symptoms reported for children who snored 
every night, were found to differ substantiallyfrom 
those in the rest of the cohort, both at the age of4 
and6(Table2). This is in agreement with several 
studies where the impact ofsnoring on behavior and 
health quality have been studied [10,12,14]. 

The association between oralbreathingand malocclusions 
is well known within the orthodontic 
community [23,24,25]. It is remarkable that in the 
present study, oral breathing had significantly 
increased between 4 and 6 years among children 
who reported snoring every night( p 
< 
0.001). The 
difference is too large to be solely explained by the 
fact that parents might be more observant of their 
children’s nightly behavior due to the participation 
in the study. The increasing prevalence of oral 
breathing can be seen as a serious risk factor for 
a further negative oro-facial development and 
might be the explanation for recurrence of SDB as 
earlier described [26]. Snoring children may thus 
develop into adults with OSAS. 

One should not only consider surgery of the adenoid 
and tonsils as treatment for snoring since we 
can see that even after ‘‘radical’’ surgery (A+ T), 
snoring may persist or recur.Parents should always 
be informed that symptoms may require further 
treatment. 

A primary justification for the surgery of the 
obstructed child must be to open up the airways 
so that physiological nose-breathing is possible. If 
the clinical check-up after surgery shows that the 
child still sleeps with open mouth afterA+T, we 
recommend examinations for stuffed nose, like septal 
deviations or allergic rhinitis. Orthodontic treatment 
may also be indicated with tongue shields or 
other devices to change a habitual open mouth 
posture. Transversal expansion might be useful for 
cases with narrow maxillas and advancing or distraction 
of the mandible in cases with micrognatia. 

The impact on health for children snoring ‘‘sometimes’’ 
(e.g. during infections and/or part of the 
nights and/or some nights, but not others), has not 
earlier been studied (to our knowledge). We could 
demonstrate that ‘‘snoring sometimes’’ also seems 

to influence children significantlyin the same direction 
as does snoring every night. Thus, snoring in 
childhood should never be neglected. 

5. 
Conclusion 
Pediatricians and generaldentists should always ask 
parents about their youngchildren’s nightly breathing/
snoring and advise them to seek appropriate 
help for all children who snore and/or breathe 
orally. A negative sleep registration does not 
exclude the need for treatment since snoring per 
se seems to negatively influence a child.
