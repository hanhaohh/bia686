Objectives: To determine whether a single polysomnographic night was a 
valid measure of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in children with 
symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing. 

Study design: The night-to-night variability of respiratory and sleep parameters 
was measured prospectively in 30 snoring children aged 1.6 to 11.3 
years (mean ± SD, 4.1 ± 2) by using 2 nocturnal polysomnograms performed 
7 to 27 days apart (14 ± 5 days). 

Results: The mean of the respiratory variables including apnea index, 
apnea/hypopnea index, arterial oxygen saturation, and end-tidal partial pressure 
of carbon dioxide were not significantly different from night to night. 
Among the sleep parameters, there was no significant night-to-night difference 
in sleep efficiency, arousal index, percent rapid eye movement, or percent 
of slow wave sleep. Only the percentage of stage 2 was significantly 
different between the nights. The polysomnographic clinical diagnosis remained 
the same on both nights for all children, although the disease severity 
differed slightly in 2 patients. 

Conclusions: There is little clinically significant night-to-night variability 
in pediatric polysomnography, and no first-night effect. These data suggest 
that a single polysomnographic night is an adequate measure of the OSAS 
in children with symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing. (J Pediatr 

2002;140:589-94.) 

Children with obstructive sleep apnea 
syndrome (OSAS) exhibit cyclic upper 
airway obstruction during sleep that 
may be associated with hypoxemia, hypercarbia, 
thoraco-abdominal asyn


chrony, and sleep disruption. The children 
typically have symptoms between 
2 and 6 years of age with adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy, snoring, and labored 
breathing. However, comprehensive

clinical history and physical examination 
alone cannot definitively identify 
OSAS among snoring children.1,2 A 
single overnight polysomnogram 
(PSG) is a well-recognized diagnostic 
tool used to determine the presence and 
severity of OSAS in symptomatic children.
2 However, few data exist regarding 
the validity and variability of PSG 
findings in children. That is, it is unknown 
whether the frequency and 
severity of OSAS among snoring children 
is sufficiently consistent from night 
to night to be accurately assessed by 
one PSG. The misclassification of

OSAS in children with symptoms of 
sleep-disordered breathing. 

METHODS 

Consecutive children who had symptoms 
of OSAS related to adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy were prospectively 
recruited into a research study involving 
2 PSGs 1 and 4 weeks apart. 

Patients 

The study population was comprised 
of 34 children younger than 12 years of 
age who came to the Sleep Disorders 
Clinic at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, 
Baltimore, Maryland, with symptoms of 
OSAS. All patients underwent a complete 
history and physical examination 
focusing on clinical evidence of OSAS 
and possible etiologic factors. Patients 
with other medical conditions known to 
affect sleep or breathing, such as craniofacial 
dysmorphism, mental retardation, 
cerebral palsy, previous otolaryngologic 
surgery, and children taking medications 
known to affect sleep, were excluded. 
Otherwise normal patients with 
snoring were prospectively and consecutively 
asked to participate in the study. 
Signed, informed consent was obtained 
from the parent and assent from children 
older than 5 years. The study was 
approved by the institutional review 
board at our hospital. 

Procedure 

Each patient underwent 2 nocturnal 
PSGs in our sleep laboratory 7 to 28 
days apart. Studies were performed in 
a designated pediatric sleep center 
with an experienced staff. The second 
study was performed before any thera

peutic intervention but did not delay 
therapy. The technician (P. G.) and 
physician (E. S. K.) scoring the second 
studies were blinded to the patient’s 
identification as well as the results of 
the initial study. The physician reviewed 
each PSG after it had been 
scored by the technician. Because children 
at our center generally undergo a 
single diagnostic PSG, the clinical 
management decisions were made on 
the basis of the initial study. 

Polysomnography 

PSG studies were performed overnight. 
No sedation or sleep deprivation 
was used. Children were accompanied 
by a parent throughout the night. Details 
of our techniques and definitions 
have been published elsewhere.9 Sleep 
architecture was assessed by standard 
techniques.10 An obstructive apnea was 
defined as the presence of chest and/or 
abdominal wall motion associated with a 
reduction of airflow =80% of baseline, 
lasting =2 breaths’ duration. The apnea 
index (AI) was defined as the number of 
obstructive apneas per hour of total 
sleep time (TST). Mixed apneas (apneas 
with central and obstructive components) 
were included in the AI. An 
obstructive hypopnea was defined as a 
reduction in airflow between 50% and 
80% of baseline associated with a drop 
in arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) 
=4%, lasting =2 breaths’ duration. The 
apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) was defined 
as the total number of obstructive 
apneas, mixed apneas, and hypopneas 
per hour of TST. Micro-arousals were 
identified according to the definition of 
the American Sleep Disorders Association.
11 The arousal index was defined as 
the number of arousals and awakenings 

per hour of TST. The percentage of TST 
during which the end-tidal partial pressure 
of carbon dioxide (PETCO2) was 
=50 mm Hg was measured. Obstructed 
hypoventilation was defined as PETCO2 
=50 mm Hg for >10% TST. The AI, 
rather than the AHI, was used as a primary 
classification variable because normative 
data for hypopneas in children 
have not been established2,12; however, 
both indices were evaluated. Although 
strict PSG diagnostic criteria have not 
been established for OSAS in children, 
a classification on the basis of our clinical 
experience and review of the literature 
was made by using the following 
guidelines2,13,14: 

1. 
Primary snoring: fulfilled all 4 of 
the following PSG criteria: (1) AI 
=1/hour, (2) SpO2 nadir >92%, (3) 
peak PETCO2 =53 mm Hg 
and duration of hypoventilation 
(PETCO2 =50 mm Hg) <10% TST, 
and (4) arousal index <10/ 
hour.15,16 Patients with frequent 
arousals associated with paradoxic 
inward rib cage movement were 
excluded to eliminate patients who 
may have had the upper airway resistance 
syndrome. 
2. 
Mild OSAS: =1 of the following 
criteria: (1) AI between 1 and 
4/hour, (2) SpO2 nadir 86% to 
91% in association with obstruction, 
and (3) duration of hypoventilation 
between 10% and 24% 
TST. 
3. 
Moderate OSAS: =1 of the following 
criteria: (1) AI between 5 
and 9/hour, (2) SpO2 nadir 76% 
to 85% in association with obstruction, 
and (3) duration of hypoventilation 
between 25% and 
49% TST. 
4. Severe OSAS: =1 of the following 
criteria: (1) AI =10/hour, (2) 
SpO2 nadir =75% in association 
with obstruction, and (3) duration 
of hypoventilation =50% TST.

variables were compared between the

was calculated for all variables.

RESULTS 

Thirty-four patients were initially recruited 
into the study. Three children 
elected not to return to the laboratory 
after the first PSG. One additional child 
had severe seizures evident on the first 
PSG and did not undergo a second 
study. These patients were excluded 
from further analysis. Demographic 
data from the 30 children who complet


ed both PSG nights are summarized in 
Table I. Seven children were considered 
obese on the basis of a body mass index 
(BMI) >95th percentile for age.17 

Mean values of the principal sleep 
and respiratory variables from the first 
PSG and night-to-night differences are 
presented in Table II. Considering all 
PSG variables, as per our routine interpretation 
protocol, 10 patients were diagnosed 
with primary snoring and 20 
with OSAS. Of the patients with 
OSAS, 9 were mild, 6 were moderate, 
and 5 were severe. None of the children 
had frequent or pathologic central 
apnea. Three children demonstrated 
obstructive hypoventilation on both 
PSGs. The clinical classification of 
OSAS or primary snoring remained the 
same on both PSG nights for all patients. 
The severity of OSAS varied in 
only 2 patients; one changed from mild 
to moderate and the other from severe 
to moderate on nights 1 to 2. Categorization 
of the patients on the basis of 
the AI alone, without regard to other 

PSG variables, would have resulted in a 
diagnostic classification change in one 
patient from primary snoring on night 1 
(AI = 0.3) to OSAS on night 2 
(AI = 5.5). However, this patient had 
frequent hypopneas and gas exchange 
abnormalities on both PSG nights. One 
patient demonstrated considerable 
night-to-night variability in AHI (AHI 

84.7 on night 1 and 32.5 on night 2) but 
was still clinically severe on both nights. 
This patient demonstrated frequent hypopneic-
appearing events that did not 
fulfill our strict desaturation criteria on 
the second study. 
No statistically significant differences 
in sleep or respiratory variables were 
observed between the nights except for 
the percent of TST in stage 2, which 
was slightly higher on the second night 
(Table II). Not only was there no significant 
difference in the AI or AHI between 
the 2 nights, but the absolute 
differences observed were small (Fig 1). 
Children with higher AIs and AHIs had 
more variability between the PSG

nights (Fig 2). There were no significant 
differences in the distribution of 
body position between the nights to explain 
this difference (Table II). 

There was no significant correlation 
between either the patient’s age and AI 
averaged between the 2 nights 
(r = –0.06) or night-to-night change in 
AI (r = 0.21), nor was there a correlation 
between the patient’s percentage of predicted 
BMI and either average AI 
(r = 0.11) or night-to-night change in AI 
(r = 0.20). Similarly, there were no significant 
correlations between either the 
patient’s age and AHI averaged between 
the 2 nights (r = 0.1) or night-to-night 
change in AHI (r = 0.23), nor between 
the patient’s percentage of predicted 
BMI and either average AHI (r = 0.17) 
or night-to-night change in AHI (r = 
0.09). Comparison of the obese and 
nonobese children revealed no significant 
difference in their AIs, AHIs, or 
night-to-night differences in both. 

Comparison of patients with high 
night-to-night AI variability (>3 
events/hour difference between the 
nights, n = 8) with patients with low AI 
variability (<3 events/hour difference 
between the nights, n = 22) revealed no 
significant differences in age, sex, or 
percentage of predicted BMI. Furthermore, 
these high- and low-variability 
groups did not differ in the average or 
night-to-night change in percent REM, 
distribution of body position, or sleep 
efficiency. Within the high variability 
group, 5 patients had an increase and 3 
patients had a decrease in AI and AHI 
on night 2 compared with night 1. 

DISCUSSION 

In our prospective series, the clinical 
diagnosis of either OSAS or primary 
snoring remained the same in all children 
undergoing 2 PSG studies 1 and 4 

THE JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS 
MAY 2002 

weeks apart. This supports the view 
that a single PSG night is sufficient for 
the diagnosis of OSAS in otherwise 
normal, snoring children. Although the 
overall classification of patients was unchanged, 
there were minimal changes in 
OSAS severity between nights. No 
night-to-night systematic bias was observed 
in any of the mean intersubject 
respiratory parameters. Among the 
sleep variables, only the percent of stage 
2 differed slightly between the nights. 
The intrasubject respiratory parameters, 
however, demonstrated considerable 
variability, particularly in children 
with severe disease (Fig 2). The variability 
in respiratory parameters could 
not be accounted for by changes in 
body position or percent REM time. 

No statistically significant differences 
were observed in the night-to-night intersubject 
means for sleep efficiency, 
percent slow wave sleep, percent REM, 
or sleep latency. Furthermore, sleep efficiency 
averaged >80% on both PSG 
nights, suggesting that the PSG did not 
have an adverse effect on sleep quality. 
Similarly, in keeping with several adult 
studies,5,19,22 the mean respiratory variables, 
AI, AHI, SpO2, and PETCO2 
were also not significantly different between 
the nights. In fact, the intraclass 
correlation coefficients of 0.86 and 0.89, 
for the AI and AHI respectively, indicate 
excellent agreement. This suggests 
that respiratory disturbances were not 
underestimated on the first PSG night. 
The AI increased between the nights in 
14 patients, decreased in 10 patients, 
and remained the same in 6 patients. 

The comparison of the nightly inter-
subject variable means by using the 
paired t test or Wilcoxon signed-rank 
test is useful in determining a systematic 
bias but does not clarify intrasubject 
agreement. In fact, high intrasubject 
variability may result in night-to-night 
means that are not significantly different. 
The intraclass correlation coefficient 
represents the average correlation 
using all possible orderings of the 2 
study nights. This statistic is highly dependent 
on the range of patient data 


THE JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS KATZ ET AL 
VOLUME 140, NUMBER 5 

and therefore generalizable only to the 
population from which the sample was 
drawn. An intraclass correlation of zero 
represents agreement no greater than 
chance, and a value of one indicates 
perfect agreement. Graphic tools may 
be useful at highlighting trends in the 
data but are not quantitative. Therefore, 
we elected to make our conclusions 
principally on the basis of the degree of 
diagnostic classification agreement. 

The clinical classification of symptomatic 
children is not exclusively based 
on the AI alone. Consideration of the 
AHI, SpO2, PETCO2, and arousal 
index also contribute to the diagnosis of 
OSAS. Pediatric OSAS may be associated 
with prolonged partial obstruction 
rather than discrete obstructive 
events.14 The one child with the highest 
AHI night-to-night variability (52.2 
events/hour) had frequent obstructive 
respiratory events on the second night, 
which did not fulfill our strict oxygen 
desaturation requirement for hypopnea. 
Review of this record clearly revealed 
the severity of the obstruction, but it 
was not reflected in the AHI. Thus, diagnostic 
interpretation of pediatric PSG 
will continue to require consideration of 
all respiratory parameters.4,6,22 In 
adults, night-to-night variability studies 
defining OSAS by a threshold level of 
>5 events/hour resulted in the misclassification 
of 8% to 43%3,4,23 of adults undergoing 
consecutive night PSGs. 
Thus, attempts to define OSAS solely in 
terms of AI or AHI “cut-off” thresholds 
may lead to misclassification. 

Little is known regarding the factors 
responsible for the night-to-night variability 
in OSAS. The potential sources 
of this variability include factors related 
to the test, as well as biologic predispositions. 
That the greatest variability was 
observed in patients with the highest 
AIs and AHIs suggests that the factors 
responsible for the severity of OSAS 
and its variability may be the same. Despite 
the high variability seen in children 
with severe OSAS, there were 
only 2 instances in which the severity 
classification differed between the 

nights. Thus, from a clinical standpoint, 
a single PSG night is also an adequate 
measure of the degree of sleep-disordered 
breathing. 

Patient factors that have been evaluated 
as sources of night-to-night variability 
include sleep architecture, body 
position, age, BMI, degree of nasal obstruction,
3 respiratory infection, morphometric 
indices, and laboratory 
conditions. Our data in children between 
2 and 11 years of age demonstrated 
that body position did not differ 
between the high- and low-variability 
groups. Furthermore, evaluation of 
night-to-night changes in body position 
did not account for the observed AI or 
AHI variability between the nights in 
this study. Previous reports indicate 
that pediatric OSAS is more severe 
during REM.16,25 Analysis of the sleepstate-
specific AIs or AHIs revealed that 
the night-to-night variation in the percent 
REM time did not account for the 
overall AI or AHI variability. The failure 
of changes in sleep state distribution 
to account for the night-to-night AI 
variability has also been previously reported 
in adults with OSAS.22,26 

Limitations of this study include the 
arbitrary nature of the severity classification, 
particularly in children who 
overlapped categories, that poses a 
source of error in that component of our 
data. The distinction between OSAS 
and primary snoring, however, relied on 
strict objective criteria and was independently 
determined by 2 observers. 
The reliability of the PSG respiratory 
data is predicated on having adequate 
sleep and REM time. Most patients had 
a sleep efficiency >75% (n = 24) and 
percent REM time >15% (n = 24) on 
both PSGs in this study. This is in keeping 
with previous data from our laboratory.
16 Because our studies were 
performed in an experienced pediatric 
sleep laboratory, the results might not 
be generalizable to an adult-oriented 
laboratory or domiciliary studies. Finally, 
insofar as esophageal manometry 
was not performed, some of the children 
with primary snoring may have ac


tually had the upper airway resistance 
syndrome. However, this shortcoming 
would have affected both studies. 

Overall, there were no significant 
differences between the nights in the 
respiratory variables and minimal differences 
in the sleep variables. Thus, a 
systematic “first night effect” was not 
observed. From a clinical standpoint, 
despite some wide intrasubject differences 
in AI or AHI between the 2 
PSGs, there was no night-to-night variability 
in the diagnosis of OSAS and 
few changes in the severity classification. 
In this symptomatic study population, 
a single-night PSG was an 
adequate measure of pediatric OSAS.
