develop in patients with DM as a result of insulin 
resistance, which independently stimulates LV 
growth. The LV mass was not greater in our patients 
with DM. 

Our method of gated SPECT does not allow the 
assessment of diastolic LV function or systolic LV 
function during stress. These were not the objectives 
of our study, which specifically evaluated systolic LV 
function, volume, and mass in gender-matched patients 
with and without DM in the absence of ischemia 
or infarction. Our results therefore do not apply to 
patients with DM who have ischemia or infarction. 
The SPECT imaging method does not have the same 
degree of resolution as other imaging methods, such 
as 2-dimensional echocardiography or magnetic resonance 
imaging. These modalities are superior for measuring 
the muscle mass, especially when the heart size 
is small, as is the case in women. However, our 
method is automated and was used in an identical 
fashion in consecutive patients separated by their gender 
and DM. We did not require coronary angiography 
to exclude ischemia or scar and relied on the results of 
stress perfusion imaging, because luminography has 
limitations in assessing the physiology of coronary 
circulation in patients with DM.

lthough early reports of obstructive sleep apnea 
(OSA) in children have shown that severe upper 
airway obstruction during sleep is associated with congestive 
heart failure,1,2 the subclinical forms of cardiac 
dysfunction in children with OSA have not been well 
characterized. There are reasons to expect that OSA has 
a negative impact on left ventricular (LV) function in 
children, because the geometry and structure of the left 
ventricle are altered in children with this disorder.3 The 
objectives of this study were to describe LV diastolic and

obstructive breathing during sleep and to measure the

Patients aged 5 to 18 years who were referred to 
the pediatric Sleep Disorder Clinic for evaluation for 
obstructive breathing during sleep were recruited sequentially 
and underwent polysomnography3 followed 
by echocardiography. The study excluded children 
with genetic syndromes and chronic medical conditions, 
including cardiac diseases. Informed consent 
was obtained from the parents or legal guardian of 
each child, and assent was obtained from children 

11 years old. The institutional review board of Children’s 
Hospital Medical Center approved the study. 
Polysomnographic results were used to subdivide

subjects into those with primary snoring (group 1) and 
those with OSA. The severity of OSA was measured 
by the frequency of apnea and hypopnea index (AHI). 
Subjects with AHI 1/hour were classified as having 
OSA and were further classified into 2 more groups; 
those with AHI from 1 to 5/hour (group 2) and those 
with AHI 5/hour (group 3). A subset of children was 
studied for a 1-year follow-up to determine the reversibility 
of cardiac dysfunction with resolution of OSA. 
To ensure resolution of OSA, children enrolled in the 
follow-up study underwent polysomnography at 8 
weeks and 1 year after the initial evaluation. 

Two-dimensional (2-D) and 2-D–directed M-mode 
echocardiographic images were recorded to determine 
LV mass and relative wall thickness. LV systolic performance 
was assessed by measuring the ejection fraction, 
the shortening fraction, and the heart-rate–corrected velocity 
of circumferential fiber shortening. Delta velocity 
of circumferential fiber shortening, a measure of contractility, 
was derived by calculating the difference between 
the measured and the predicted fiber shortening for the 
measured wall stress according to the previously described 
equation.4 The primary measure of afterload was 
the meridional end-systolic wall stress. LV diastolic 
function was evaluated by mitral inflow velocity. The 
E/A ratio was derived from the velocity of the early (E) 
wave occurring during early diastolic filling and the 
velocity of the second wave (A) occurring during atrial 
contraction. 

Echocardiographic and blood pressure measurements 
were obtained by standardized conditions at rest 
with the subjects in the supine position after a minimum 
rest period of 5 minutes. Cardiologists and 
sonographers were blinded to the results of the polysomnography. 


For comparison of means, a 1-factor analysis of 
variance was performed. Multiple regression analysis

was performed to identify factors that might predict 
LV function. The independent variables entered into a 
backward elimination regression analysis were age, 
gender, race, Z score for body mass index, systolic 
and diastolic blood pressures expressed as percentage 
of the 95th percentile, log AHI, desaturation index, 
lowest oxygen saturation, maximum end-tidal carbon 
dioxide, and LV mass index. A total sample size of 20 
children was estimated to provide adequate power in 
the follow-up study. The paired t 
test was performed 
to compare the changes in cardiac function in each 
group from baseline to the end of the follow-up. 
Sixty-three patients satisfied the inclusion criteria and 
completed the study. The demographic and polysomnographic 
characteristics are listed Table 1. 

A decrease in the LV diastolic function across the 3 
groups was demonstrated by the progressive decrease in 

the E/A ratio (Figure 1). The mean . 
SD for the E/A ratio was 2.16 0.4, 

2.0 0.4, and 1.78 0.3 for groups 1 
to 3, respectively. The decrease in the 
E/A ratio was due primarily to an increase 
in the A-wave velocity. The 
difference in the E/A ratio remained 
statistically significant (p 0.007) after 
controlling for age, gender, race, 
systolic and diastolic blood pressures 
expressed as a percentage of the 95th 
percentile, and the Z score for body 
mass index. 
The model that predicted LV diastolic 
function (p 0.0014) included log AHI (. 
. 
0.04, p 0.0016), systolic blood pressure expressed 
as a percentage of the 95th percentile (. 
0.003, p 
. 
0.008), and Z score for body mass index (. 
. 
0.015, p . 
0.015) with R2 . 
0.23. The AHI remained 
statistically significant (p 0.0006) after age, 
gender, race, and diastolic blood pressure expressed as 
a percentage of the 95th percentile were forced into 
the model with an overall value of p 0.01. 

LV end-systolic wall stress did not differ significantly 
among the 3 groups. Wall stress was 42 9, 46 
12, and 41 10 g/cm2 for groups 1 to 3, respectively. 
The indexes of the contractile state of the left 
ventricle were not significantly different among the 3 
groups (Table 2). 

As previously described,3 a dose-dependent increase 
in the LV mass index was observed with in-

creased severity of OSA. The LV mass index was 32.5 
. 
3.6, 38.7 . 
9.6, and 39.8 . 
8.7 g/height2.7 for 
groups 1 to 3, respectively (p . 
0.007). The diastolic 
function did not correlate with LV mass index (R . 
0.1). Similarly, the change in diastolic function after 
treatment did not correlate with the change in the LV 
mass index. 

Children with AHI 5/hour and those with AHI 1 
to 5/hour who had daytime symptoms were offered 
treatment with tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy 
and/or continuous positive airway pressure. 

Ten adequately treated children with OSA and 10 
age-and gender-matched children with primary snoring 
were recruited for a 1-year follow-up study. One child in 
the primary snoring group had a technically inadequate 
echocardiogram at 1 year and 1 child in the OSA group 
did not comply with treatment with continuous positive 
airway pressure. The demographic and polysomnographic 
characteristics are listed in Table 3. 

Six children had adenotonsillectomy, 1 child had 
an additional uvulopalatoplasty, and 3 children were 
managed with continuous positive airway pressure. 
Children managed with continuous positive airway 
pressure were followed quarterly in the clinic. Compliance 
with continuous positive airway pressure was 
ascertained from parental report. 

The E/A ratio improved by 18% (p . 
0.001) in the 
OSA group, but no difference was observed in children 
with primary snoring (Figure 2). Children with 
primary snoring showed a trend toward a lower diastolic 
function at the end of the follow-up. Two of the 
3 children who largely contributed to this decline 
developed a mild degree of OSA. 

This study shows the independent effect of OSA on 
LV function in children without clinical evidence of 
cardiac dysfunction. The negative correlation between 
the severity of OSA and LV diastolic function is 
independent of obesity, blood pressure, and LV mass. 
To our knowledge, this study also shows for the first 
time that LV diastolic function in children with OSA 
improves after the disorder is adequately treated. The 
importance of this observation stems from the knowledge 
that diastolic dysfunction in adults is now increasingly 
emphasized as an early indicator of cardiac 
disability and may precede systolic dysfunction and 
heart failure6,7 Whether LV diastolic dysfunction in 
children has the same clinical significance as in adults 
is not known. O’Leary et al5 showed that children with 
increased end-diastolic LV pressure proved by cardiac 
catheterization have a lower E/A ratio (1.9 vs 2.3) 
compared with healthy controls. These findings suggest 
that in children, small deviations of E/A ratio 
from normal values may reflect early LV hemodynamic 
abnormalities. 

LV hypertrophy is a well-recognized mechanism for 
LV dysfunction in adults and in children8–10 This study 
could not demonstrate that LV hypertrophy is a mechanism 
for LV dysfunction, however. In some hypertensive 
patients and patients with diabetes mellitus, diastolic 
dysfunction has been observed in the absence of LV 

hypertrophy11,12 In these patients, altered myocardial energy 
metabolism was associated with LV dysfunction.13 

Classically, OSA in children has been linked to right 
ventricular dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension; 
however, the mechanisms of pulmonary hypertension in 
children with OSA have not been thoroughly investigated. 
Several studies that examined the contributing 
factors to pulmonary hypertension in adult subjects with 
OSA have demonstrated that an increase in pulmonary 
venous pressure contributes to an elevation of pulmonary 
artery pressure14,15 To our knowledge, the relation between 
LV diastolic function and pulmonary wedge pressure 
has not been studied in subjects with OSA. However, 
in patients with coronary artery disease and 
diastolic dysfunction, the E/A ratio was found to be the 
most important determinant of pulmonary wedge pressure.
16 In our study, limited data on pulmonary artery 
pressure did not allow the relation between LV dysfunction 
and pulmonary hypertension to be examined.
