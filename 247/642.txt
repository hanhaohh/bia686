hyperhydrosis (SHY).16 This instrument was translated for the Flemish 
population and showed a good validity.18 

As stated, besides these items, several other questions pertaining to 
sleep behaviors of school-aged children were in the HBQ. From a total 
of 49 sleep items used throughout the HBQ, ie the 26 SDSC items 
included, 36 were selected. That is, 21 of the SDSC and 15 other items 
used in the HBQ. Via item analysis, the overlapping sleep items, ie, 
semantically similar items (eg, “the child sleep walks” versus “you saw 
the child sleepwalking”), and the items that are an assemblage of distinct 
sleep characteristics, with consequently lower predictive value, were 
excluded. 

As a result, congruent to the SDSC subscales, the following changes 
were made (each item is printed within the disorders subscales paragraphs 
of the result section; Table 1-6). DIMS: We excluded 2 items 
referring to total sleep time and sleep-onset latency because they are part 
of the sleep-wake pattern, which will be dealt with in our separate index 
(see below). The other 5 SDSC items in this factor remained; additionally, 
we added an item referring to wake-up time that is too early or 
“terminal insomnia” (item 6). SBD: The SDSC has 3 items questioning 
breathing during sleep. We replaced the item “snoring” with “snoring 
loudly” (item 9) and added 2 more items describing disturbed breathing 
(ie, snorting or gasping [item 10] and a whistling or wheezing sound of 
the chest [item 11]. DA: Differentiating between sleep terror (pavor nocturnes) 
and nightmare (dream anxiety attack or rapid eye movement 
nightmare) is difficult for laypersons. In our HBQ, we rephrased the 
questions based on a simple description of their apparent polysomnographic 
features (see Table 3). Cross-tabulation of these 4 items indicated 
some diversity in perception, but the inclusion of all of them was statistically 
advantageous. SWTD: The item “nocturnal hyperkinesias” in 
the SDSC[2] was disentangled into 2 items: “hyperkinesias” (item 22) 
and “periodic leg movements” (item 23). Consequently, a subscale of 7 
items was formed. DES: We added 6 extra items referring to specific situations 
where the child might fall asleep. These items were selected 
because of their clinical relevance in the pediatric population. SHY: The 
2 items from the SDSC remained. 

Adding indexes (Step B) 

In a previous study,19 we encountered the flexibility of questioning the 
sleep-wake pattern via open questions. Additionally, the distinction in 
sleep hygiene for weekend and weekdays could be made, which is on its 
own very informative. Also a sleep efficiency index for these weeklong 
periods can be calculated. The weekend and weeklong sleep efficiency 
index was averaged and recoded into 5 categories, a categorization based 
on clinical findings and literature.11,20 

Other sleep items in the HBQ were co-sleeping (same room or same 
bed) and the presence of noise, light, or noise and light. These 4 conditions 
were rated independently by 5 sleep researchers from different 
countries, and, based on the concordance between their ratings (Kendall 
concordance of 0.89), a sleep environment index was formed. 

The item “sleep enuresis” was not in the SDSC. Because of the age 
range of our population, the relation of “sleep enuresis” was of special 
interest. It was also scored on a 5-point scale, and its relation to other 
disorders was modeled. 

Modeling the relationships (Step C) 

After the exclusion of aberrant sleep items and the addition of new 
items (eg “terminal insomnia”), based on item analysis and clinical intuition, 
their relationships were modeled. That is, modulation of

Data Analysis 

To find a “final model” with adequate internal consistency and validity, 
the following analyses have been carried out. For Modulation 1 and 
2, each of the following statistical analyses was performed until an 
acceptable model was found. 

The heterogeneity of the model was analyzed via factor analysis using 
the principal component extraction method and the varimax rotation 
method. To select the number of components to be extracted, we applied 
the Kaiser criterion. An item-reliability analysis was performed to investigate 
the internal consistency; as such, the standardized Cronbach a 
and 
item-total correlation were calculated. These analyses were performed 
by means of the Statistica version 6 (Statsoft Inc., Tulsa, OK). 

Item response theory analysis allowed ordering of person and item on 
the latent trait, provided that the necessary conditions, single and double 
monotonicity, were fulfilled. The Mokken Scale analysis for Polytomous 
Items (MSPwin version 5, iec ProGAMMA, Groningen; 21) was used. 
Coefficients (of Loevinger) of 0.30 or higher indicate an acceptable to 
very good scalability power. For the structural equation modeling (maximum 
likelihood estimates), ie, the modulation of relationships between 
observed and latent variables, and between latent variables themselves, 
the statistical program AMOS (version 4, SmallWaters Corporation, 
Chicago, IL; 22) was used. Since large sample sizes are known to influence 
the results of the .2 test, we focused on the goodness of fit 
indices.[3] Besides these, the standardized regression weights (ß) as correlations 
will also be reported. 

For Modulation 3, only structural equation modeling was calculated. 
Analyses were performed on a random selection of subjects (n = 1520) 
and then evaluated in the total sample.

Modulation of the Relationships Within each Subscale 

Because of the changes made on item level, we first analyzed the heterogeneity 
of the “selected sleep-wake questionnaire” items. From the 
total of 36 items, 9 principal components were extracted, which 
explained 58.33% of the variance. That is, the 6 components of the 
SDSC were reproduced with the exception of the subscale DES that

appeared to be heterogeneous. This resemblance in factor structure 
allows us to report the SDSC-like subscales separately. 

As shown in Table 1, these 6 items form 1 principal component, which 
explained by itself 36.90% of the variance. The lowest item-total correlations 
found were for the items “terminal insomnia” (item 6) and “going 
to bed reluctantly” (item 1). But deleting any of the items could not ameliorate 
the standardized Cronbach a, ie, 0.64. The scale coefficient H of 
these items was 0.32, minus item 6, of which item H was too low to be 
included. Due to the double monotonicity of this subscale, an ordering 
of the 5 items was attained, ie, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. This means that when a 
child has a (high) positive score on item 5, he or she will also have (high) 
positive scores on the former items. 

The goodness of fit index of the newly formed DIMS subscale indicated 
a very good fit, ie, GFI = 0.990, AGFI = 0.978 with RMR = 0.019 
(.2 of 84.719 with 9 df). No error covariances were needed. The standardized 
regression weights of the items 1 and 6 were at the lower bound 
(see Table 1). 

In correspondence with the Kaiser criterion, 2 factors were extracted 
explaining 65.40% of the variance (Table 2). Forcing them to load on 1 
factor brought the explained variance to 44.82%, with the lowest factor 
loading of 0.42 for item 9. The standardized Cronbach a 
for these 5 
items was 0.67, with the previous item having the lowest item-total correlation 
(Table 2). The ordering of the items was 9, 10, 7, 11, and 8, 
which is in increasing grade of “severity” of breathing disorders. The 
scalability coefficient of Loevinger was 0.31. 

For the SBD-subscale, the goodness of fit indices indicated a very 
good fit: GFI = 0.997, AGFI = 0.985 with RMR = 0.006 (.2 of 22.131 
with 3 df). Small error covariances between items 10 and 11 (r = 0.237, 
P< .0001) but also between 9 and 10 (r = 0.176, P< .0001) were 
allowed. 

When extracting only 1 component, the explained variance dropped to 
52.26% (2 components explained 74.01%); nevertheless, the loadings 
remained high (Table 3). The Cronbach a 
of 0.77 was indicative of relations 
between the items. Item 12 had the weakest contribution to this 
subscale. The severity of the items or the likelihood to exhibit sleep 
problems such as 15 or 12 was lower than 16, 13, and 14. This subscale 
had a scalability coefficient of 0.46. 

Several combinations of these 5 items were explored, yet the best fit 
was found for inclusion of all items and allowing the errors of item 12 
and 13 (r = 0.253, P< .0001), and also 13 and 14 (r = 0.439, P< .0001) 
to covariate. The goodness of fit achieved for this subscale was GFI = 
0.962, AGFI = 0.810 with RMR = 0.022, indicating some discrepancy 
between the specified and saturated model but still acceptable (Table 3). 

All items loaded on 1 component explaining 35.78% of the variance 
(Table 4). Item 21 had the lowest loading. It also had the lowest item-
total correlation but the standard Cronbach a 
of 0.69 could not be 
increased via deletion of any of the items. Due to a too-low item-H coefficient, 
item 21 was excluded from the Mokken scale analysis. With a 
scalability coefficient of 0.34, the remaining items could be ordered 22, 
20, 19, 17, 23, and 18. The child receiving a (high) positive score on item 
18 also has (high) positive scores on the previous items. 

The specified SWTD subscale had a very good fit; GFI = 0.961, AGFI 
= 0.922 with RMR = 0.028 (.2 of 438.579 with 14 df). No error covariances 
were needed. 

Heterogeneity of this subscale was revealed via factor analysis (Table 
5). Extraction via the Kaiser criterion resulted in 3 components that 
explained 65.03% of the variance. Extracting just 1 component caused a 
substantive drop in the amount of explained variance, ie, 33.03%; nevertheless 
the loadings on this single component remained above .30, 
which was still acceptable. The standardized Cronbach a 
was 0.78, and 
the item-total correlations were tolerable, with the exception of item 29. 
Deleting this item had no beneficial influence on the Cronbach a. The 
results from the Mokken scale analysis indicated that the specified DES 
subscale was unidimensional and had a scalability coefficient of 0.38. 
Item ordering was not possible when item 29 was still included. After 
deletion of this item, the scalability coefficient increased until 0.46, and 
the double monotonicity assumption was accepted. The item ordering is 
25, 24, 26, 27, 28, 30, 32, 31, 34, and 33. The latter 5 items have an equal 
“impact” or have an equal likelihood to be scored positive when previous 
items received a (high) positive score. As shown in Table 5, 3 items 
had a very low standardized regression weight, whereas 4 other items 
had a very high standardized regression weight. Analyses have been performed 
on the SDCS items and the newly added items separately, which 
revealed better standardized regression coefficients, but since the other 
analyses on this subscale indicated unidimensionality and a good internal 
consistency, we kept them in 1 subscale. Moreover the fit of this sub-
scale is very good: GFI = 0.951, AGFI = 0.913 and RMR = 0.046.

The 2 items explain 85.53% of the variance and have a high internal 
consistency, ie, 0.82. An ordering of the items is not at hand because of 
the limited number of items within this subscale. And also therefore, the 
global fit could not be estimated (Table 6). 

Modulation of the Relationships Between the Subscales or the First Order 
Model 

Based on the aforementioned results, we modeled the first order relationships 
between these 6 subscales. As stated, the factor analysis of all 
36 items reveals SDSC-like subscales. The Cronbach a 
of all 36 items is 

0.88. 
Since the double monotonicity assumption can be accepted, the sub-
scale scores can be ordered, ie, DIMS, SWTD, DES, SHY, SBD, and 
DA, with a scalability coefficient of 0.39. 

With fit indices of GFI = 0.897, AGFI = 0.879, and RMR = 0.055, this 
first order model had an acceptable fit. The error covariances drawn for 
each subscale are still valid. Extra error covariances were drawn 
between items 22 and 23 (r = 0.25, P< .001) and items 23 and 17 (r = 
0.34, p< 0.001). The relationships between the subscales can be found in 
Table 7. 

Modulation of the Relationships Between the Subscales and Their 
Respective Classification Category or the Second Order Model 

In the next modulation, we wanted to implement the ICSD dyssomnia-
parasomnia categories on these subscales or form a second order 
model. Dyssomnias comprised the subscales DIMS, SBD, and DES, 
whereas parasomnias included the subscales DA and SWTD. The sub-
scale SHY was allowed to correlate with both categories. This division

0.880, and RMR = 0.055. However, it revealed highly significant relationships 
(P< .001): a 0.93 correlation between the specified dyssomnias 
and parasomnias and an equally average correlation between the 
subscale SHY and the 2 categories (respectively, r = 0.58 and r = 0.55). 
The changes in standardized regression weights of the items between the 
first and second order model were minor and thus not printed. Table 8 
shows the standardized regression weights between the first and second 
order variables. 

The Indexes 

The relationships of sleep efficiency, sleep environment, and “sleep 
enuresis” to the first and second order models were also modeled. 

Modulation of the Relationships between the Indexes and the First Order 
Model 

The sleep efficiency index was modeled in the first order model. In 
comparison to the first order model, adding this index did not improve 
the global fit substantially (GFI = 0.898, AGFI = 0.880, and RMR = 
0.054), but significant standardized regression weights were found for 
the subscales DIMS (ß 
= 0.35, P < .001) and DES (ß 
= 0.07, P< .05). 
The subscales SHY, DA, and SBD were marginally significant. 

The global fit of the first order model with inclusion of the sleep environment 
index remained similar (GFI = 0.898, AGFI = 0.881, and RMR 
= 0.054). Very low but significant standardized regression weights were 
found for the subscales DIMS (ß 
= 0.10, P< .05) and DES (ß 
= 0.06, P 
< .05). 

Adding the item “sleep enuresis” in the first order model did not 
improve the overall fit (GFI = 0.897, AGFI = 0.879, and RMR = 0.054) 
but revealed significant standardized regression weights with the sub-
scales DIMS, DES, and SWTD; ie, ß 
= 0.12 (P < .05), ß 
= 0.06 (P < .05) 
and ß 
= -0.15 (P < .05), respectively.

subscale SHY (Table 9). The RMR indicated a slightly better fit (GFI = 
0.898, AGFI = 0.882, and RMR = 0.051) when adding the indexes. 

Of interest was the relation of the 3 indexes with the categories dyssomnias 
and parasomnias. 

The standardized regression weights of the sleep efficiency and the 
sleep environment indexes were highly significant (see Table 9) with 
both categories. A significant negative standardized regression weight 
was found for sleep enuresis and parasomnias (ß 
= – 0.28, P< .05) and 
a positive one with dyssomnias (ß 
= 0.35, P< .001). 

The predictive value of sleep environment and sleep efficiency 
towards the SHY items was found to be small but significant (see Table 
9). Sleep enuresis was of no explanatory significance to the subscale 
SHY. 

DISCUSSION 

Sleep questionnaires are often used in research. However, only a few 
studies have fully explored the psychometric characteristics of the questionnaire 
used; some describe the relationships between sleep disorders 
during childhood from a purely statistical point of view. Through the 
modulation of the sleep items used in our study, we aimed to contribute 
to the limited statistical knowledge of their relationships.4,14-16 The final 
model had an acceptable fit, which has good psychometric characteristics 
and reflects the ASDC (Table 9).17 Additionally, the subscales 
appeared to be valuable when used individually. 

Some remarks should be made concerning the data on which this final 
model was based. The data represented a recollection of parental awareness 
of sleep disorders of their child.9,23 Although data collection was not 
stratified, analyses of some ambiguous confounding variables stated in 
the literature, such as socioeconomic status, age, and sex distribution9,11,24-
26 were carried out after data collection. None of them were 
found to constrain the modulation of sleep disorders as in a “general 
population.” In addition, the prevalence of sleep disorders found here 
resembles those found in previous studies. 

The First and Second Order Models 

The developmental characteristic of sleep architecture and problems 
should encourage researchers to statistically unravel the relationships 
both within and between age groups and to quantify clinical intuition. 
The strong correlation found in this study between dyssomnias and parasomnias 
underlines the clinical assumption that these cannot be handled 
separately in the school-aged child.27 However, not all sleep disorders 
within these categories were closely related. 

The subscale DES, as specified here, showed ample relationship with 
the other subscales, and its predictive power to the category dyssomnias 
was limited. In a separate structural-equation model, not reported here, 
we also analyzed its importance toward parasomnias, but equally low 
results were found. This outsider position of the DES subscale, in the 
first- and second order models, could be ascribed to the nature of the 
items, or to the subjectivity of the complaint and, in conjunction with the 
latter, the age range of our survey. Few studies have reported these sleep-
related symptoms in a preadolescent population.9,28,29 Therefore, we also 
added “specific” situations to the DES subscale. For example “falling 
asleep while watching TV” (item 29), in comparison to the other specific 
situations where the child might fall asleep, is more heterogeneous in 
its interpretation30; moreover, it is known to be influenced by television 
habits of the parents.31 Consequently, it had low predictive value in our 
study. Other symptoms of somnolence, ie, the items questioning waking 
up, showed little contribution to DES; nevertheless, the presence of 
them, ie, within clinical range, is precursory for sudden sleep attacks, 
which can be deferred from our item ordering. 

The subscales DIMS, DA, and SWTD showed strong relationships in 
our first order model. Thus, the items comprised by these subscales 
appear to be alike from the viewpoint of the parent. Their perception as 
a common sleep behavior instead of a separate sleep “disorder” probably 
lies underneath. The clinician using only selective items of these dis-

SLEEP, Vol. 27, No. 3, 2004 499 Pediatric Sleep Disorders—Spruyt et al 


order subscales should keep in mind that it is difficult for a caregiver to 
discriminate between these items. 

Item 6, “terminal insomnia,” has only a minor contribution towards 
DIMS. Few studies11,32 can be found where “terminal insomnia” in children 
was questioned, even though 5.8% of the children in 1 other study33 
and 6.9% in our study were reported to show this problem. Suspecting a 
misinterpretation by the respondent or impurity of the item in terms of 
insufficient amount of sleep might be abandoned based on the adequate 
amount of sleep, ie, deduced from the mean and the sleep efficiency 
index, found in this study. Another weak indicator of DIMS is item 1 
“going to bed reluctantly.” Despite this, it is a common item in questionnaires, 
and, in literature, many synonyms for this item can be found, 
such as bedtime resistance, reluctance to settle to sleep, or bedtime struggles.
23 In addition, to what extent the parent is qualified, when scoring 
this item, to distinguish the problem from a limit-setting disorder or 
sleep-onset association disorder is unknown. Difficulty falling asleep 
(item 2) appeared to be the best indicator of DIMS. The child who has 
problems falling asleep after awakening several night a week, which is 
within the clinical range, will very likely exhibit difficulties falling 
asleep and anxiety when falling asleep. 

Confounding elements such as anxiety and (partial) arousal might 
possibly ground the strong correlation between the DIMS, DA, and 
SWTD subscales, either at the onset or during or the end of sleep period.
34,35 More specific for DA, the distinction between nightmares and 
night terrors is not straightforward for a nonclinician to ascertain. Muris 
et al36 screened for anxiety symptoms and noted that 80.5% of Dutch 
children aged 4 to 12 years were reported to have scary dreams. Simonds 
and Parraga24 stated that nightmares diminished with increasing age and 
sleep terrors were more prominent in the youngest age group. Thus, in 
the literature, differences in prevalence can be noted and the co-occurrence 
of items in the DA and SWTD subscales has been underlined in 
several epidemiologic reports. Within the DA subscale, the item sleepwalking 
has the lowest contribution. A marginal note might be that 
minor differences in item analysis were found between the formulations 
“your child sleepwalks” versus “you saw the child sleepwalking.” For 
the SWTD subscale, the weakest indicator is bruxism. The minor predictive 
value of these 2 items within the DA and SWTD subscale might 
be due to their low incidence over a long period—being noticed or not— 
or due to other confounding variables evoking their exhibition, such as 
emotional or physical stressors. The 3 subscales can be ordered; having 
a (high) positive score on the subscale DA, the child has (high) positive 
scores on SWTD and DIMS. 

In the first order model, the subscale SBD has a moderate correlation 
with each of these 3 subscales. It also is of moderate explanatory value 
toward dyssomnias, its relation in the second order model. The ordering 
of items within this subscale reveals that a child will score positive on 
the item apnea whenever he or she has (high) positive scores on the other 
breathing items. The weakest item to indicate SBD was item 9, “snores 
loudly.” This can be explained by the impurity of the item, namely it 
does not state the absence of rhinitis, allergies, and other causes of snoring. 
These medical conditions were found to be associated with items 
screening for breathing problems in the child (11 and many others). 

In contrast to other research underlining the co-occurrence of breathing 
difficulties during sleep, such as snoring, and daytime somnolence, 
we found only a moderate correlation between the 2 subscales, ie, SBD 
and DES. This might be due to our item selection but might as well be 
ascribed to the difference in approach. Namely, co-occurrences or correlations 
found throughout the literature are mostly drawn on item level, 
whereas we analyzed them on subscale disorder level, subscales that 
were statistically confirmed. The SBD subscale also correlates moderately 
with SHY, which is in accordance with the findings of Bruni et al.16 

Since SHY is a proposed sleep disorder in the ICSD,2 its position is 
yet underdetermined, and future research will hopefully clarify its significance. 
In our first order model, the best correlations were found to be 
with SWTD, DIMS, and DA, respectively, with decreasing magnitude. 
In our second order model, we also found that SHY correlates with equal 

strength with our categories dyssomnias and parasomnias. 

The First and Second Order Models with Indexes 

In our first order model, only small but significant predictive values 
for both sleep efficiency and sleep environment to the DIMS and DES 
were found. In the second order model, sleep efficiency was found to be 
a good indicator of dyssomnias, while its contribution towards parasomnias 
was moderate and negative, a finding that is in accordance with 
clinical intuition. Logically, all childhood sleep evaluations should comprise 
the sleep-wake schedule even if the primary complaint suggests 
other problems.37 The data on sleep architecture and duration in the normal 
child11,38,39 might guide us in the clinical interpretation of its relation 
with dyssomnias and parasomnias. 

In the second order model, sleep environment, as specified here, contributed 
equally to dyssomnias and parasomnias. Yet, the contribution to 
this latter sleep category was found to be negative. An association 
between poor sleep and a sleeping environment with exposure to noise 
and light was found in the study of Kahn et al40 and in others. 

For both of these indexes, we want to remind readers that associations 
or co-occurrence with sleep problems are habitually inferred at the item 
level. 

In the first order model, sleep enuresis had a minor though significant 
contribution to DES, DIMS, and SWTD, ie, in increasing order and for 
the latter one negative. In both the ASDC17 and the ICSD,2 sleep enuresis 
is placed under parasomnias. However, our analyses show that its 
contribution to parasomnias and dyssomnias is equally substantive, even 
if of opposite sign, ie, negative and positive, respectively. This finding 
underlines the complexity of sleep enuresis, which has been the subject 
of many studies.41-44 

When including these indexes, the clinician, as well as the researcher, 
will gain extra information that can be helpful in the interpretation of 
sleep problems. 

In conclusion, we found that some items commonly used in pediatric 
sleep questionnaires have limited predictive value toward a specific 
sleep disorder, as classified according to ASDC.17 Nevertheless, the 
sleep disorders, or the specified subscales, in general showed a good fit 
in a normal population of children aged 6 to 13 year. Apart from the position 
of DES, our modulations confirmed the classification underlying the 
SDSC, an instrument that was also validated in a clinical population. 

Since sleep and its disorders in the child are complex and approximately 
30% of the children exhibit a sleep problem in at least one 
domain, an international classification system, where the presentation, 
the underlying causes, the significance, and others are written, would be 
useful to all disciplines involved in pediatric sleep research. Our final 
model can be seen as an attempt to stress the importance of item specification 
as selection. As such, it could be a step toward a classification 
system as well as a step toward a more critical use of pediatric sleep 
items (see addendum). It is noteworthy, in contrast to the lack of instruments 
for the analyses of nighttime behavior, that an abundant number 
of instruments assessing daytime behavior can be found. This denotes 
that the developmental aspect of a pediatric population is a challenge and 
not an obstruction. Further studies in normal and clinical child populations 
are therefore desirable to quantify the relationships between sleep-
related behaviors and disorders to wider health issues.

IN ADDENDUM 

When deciding to use a sleep problem questionnaire the practitioner should be very cautious 
about the item formulation. In this study, the items listed below had low predictive value (* 
= Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children item).16 This might be due to 
-The low prevalence of the sleep disturbances during the suggested period, eg, last 3 

months 
-The difficulty in detecting or discriminating them as a caregiver 
-The possibility of a blurred interpretation, ie, lack of preciseness in the formulation 

Disorders of Initiating and Maintaining Sleep: 

- 
Item 6: terminal insomnia or the child wakes up too early and can’t get back to sleep 
- 
Item 1*: going to bed reluctantly 
Sleep Breathing Disorders 

- 
Item 9: snores loudly (or even the SDSC-item ‘the child snores’ appeared to be weak) 
- 
Item 10: snorting or gasping 
- 
Item 11: wheezing or whistling of the chest 
Disorders of Arousal 
This disorder subscale is a peculiar one, since the standardized regression weights of the 
items in the individual disorder subscale versus the final model fluctuate greatly. As stated, 
the performed statistical analyses could not differentiate enough to determine which items are 
the best to use. Therefore, we suggest 2 solutions: 

- 
In accordance to Kahn and coworkers,40 ie, to pool the “nightmare” and “sleep terror” 
items as 1 item, namely “night fears” 
- 
In accordance to Muris and coworkers,36,45 ie, to elaborate on the origin, content, coping 
behavior, and severity via separate questions. 
Further research should focus on this. 

Sleep-Wake Transition Disorders 

- 
Item 21*: bruxism 
- 
Item 18: rhythmic movement disorder 
Disorders of Excessive Somnolence 

- 
Item 26*: sleep paralysis 
- 
Item 24*: difficulty waking up 
- 
Item 25*: tired when waking up 
- 
Item 27*: daytime somnolence 
- 
Item 28*: sleep attacks 
- 
Item 29: falling asleep watching TV 
Sleep Hyperhydrosis 
None. 

In conclusion, based on our results, ie, in a “normal” population and from the caregivers’ perspective, 
these items should be rephrased better or interpreted in the realm of their limitations.
