Study objectives: To measure the accuracy and reliability of a portable home oximetry monitor 
with an automated analysis for the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in children. 
Design: Prospective cohort study. 
Setting: Alberta Lung Association Sleep Center, Alberta Children’s Hospital Sleep Clinic. 
Study subjects: Consecutive, otherwise healthy children, aged 4 to 18 years, presenting to the 
Pediatric Sleep Service at the Alberta Children’s Hospital for assessment of possible OSA. 
Interventions: All subjects underwent 2 nights of monitoring in the home with an oximetry-based 
portable monitor with an automatic internal scoring algorithm. A third night of monitoring was 
done simultaneously with computerized laboratory polysomnography according to American 
Thoracic Society guidelines. 
Measurements and results: Both test-retest reliability of the portable monitor-based desaturation 
index (DI) between 2 nights at home and between laboratory and home were high using the 
Bland and Altman analysis (mean agreement, 0.32 and 0.64; limits of agreement, – 8.00 to 8.64 
and – 0.75 to 6.50, respectively). The polysomnographic apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) agreed 
poorly with the portable monitor DI (mean difference, 1.27; limits of agreement, – 12.02 to 
15.02). The sensitivity and specificity of the monitor for the identification of moderate sleep 
apnea (polysomnography AHI > 5/h) were 67% and 60%, respectively. 
Conclusion: Portable monitoring based only on oximetry alone is not adequate for the identification 
of OSA in otherwise healthy children. (CHEST 2003; 124:1702–1708)

may be adequate for the identification of OSA in 
otherwise healthy children.1 The American Academy 
of Pediatrics published clinical practice guidelines2 
for the diagnosis and management of childhood 
OSA, and suggests that positive abbreviated testing, 
including simple oximetry, may be helpful, but that 
children with negative screening test results should 
undergo more comprehensive evaluation. 

The only study3 published on validation of unattended 
monitoring in children suspected of having 
OSA used modified polysomnography that had most 
components of the laboratory study except EEG and 
carbon dioxide measurements. Sleep technicians 
went to the patients’ homes in order to set up 
equipment at night and returned in the morning to 
retrieve it.3 The results of this study are impressive 
and strongly support abbreviated testing; however, 
this type of ambulatory testing is not typical of most 
abbreviated home testing protocols.

OSA in children has been studied. Oximetry interpretations 
were done manually using both oximetry 
and pulse waveform data. The positive predictive 
value was 97%, suggesting an abnormal study finding 
would eliminate the need for full polysomnography. 
However, the sensitivity of overnight oximetry was 
low (40%), confirming that a normal oximetry result 
does not rule out a diagnosis of OSA in children.4 
Subsequent to this report, Urschitz et al5 published 
reference values for nocturnal home pulse oximetry 
in young children. We elected to evaluate a simple, 
oximetry-based portable monitor that has been validated 
in adults suspected of having sleep apnea6 to 
determine its diagnostic accuracy and reliability in a 
population of children referred to a pediatric sleep 
clinic with suspected OSA. 

Materials and Methods 

Patient Selection 

A consecutive sample of otherwise healthy children aged 4 to 
18 years were studied. The minimum age of 4 years was selected 
to minimize data loss related to incomplete home studies and to 
ensure that all study subjects were in a low surgical risk group.7,8 
All patients were referred for evaluation of suspected OSA to the 
Pediatric Sleep Service at the Alberta Children’s Hospital by 
community general practitioners, pediatricians, or otolaryngologists 
between October 1, 2000 and January 31, 2002. Children 
with complex medical conditions were excluded (Table 1) from 
enrollment. Ethics approval for the study was received from the 
Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board, Faculty of Medicine, 
University of Calgary. Consent to participate was obtained from 
all primary caregivers, and direct assent was obtained for all 
children aged . 
12 years. 

Laboratory Polysomnography 

Computerized laboratory polysomnography was performed 
according to American Thoracic Society guidelines1 using the 
Sandman NT (Nellcor Puritan Bennett; Ottawa, ON) and included 
EEG (C2-A1, C3-A2, O1-A2, O2-A1); electro-oculogram; 
submental electromyogram; ECG; oxygen saturation monitoring 
(N200; Nellcor Puritan Bennett); chest, abdominal wall, and sum 
channel movements using respiratory inductance plethysmography 
(Respitrace Plus; SensorMedics Corporation; Yorba Linda, 
CA); bilateral tibial electromyograms; nasal/oral airflow using a

Protocol 

Three different recordings using the oximetry monitor were 
performed. During laboratory polysomnography, the oximetry 
unit received data from an additional oxygen saturation probe. 
Two unattended studies using only the portable monitor were 
performed in the patients’ homes as well. These were done within 
1 week of the overnight laboratory polysomnography. Patients 
were randomized to determine the order of laboratory and home 
studies. For unattended home study nights, the child’s caregiver 
received the portable monitor from a trained technician at the 
hospital and was instructed on its use. The caregiver applied the 
sensor to the child before going to sleep: the oxygen saturation 
finger/toe probe. The monitor was initiated and then turned 
off/unplugged in the morning. After a night of home study, the 
unit was either returned to the sleep laboratory or a technician 
would go to the home in order to download the data to a personal 
computer for automatic analysis. 

Scoring of Portable Monitor Studies 

Unlike polysomnography and standard oximetry testing that 
require manual interpretation, the portable monitor (SnoreSat; 
SagaTech Electronics; Calgary, AB, Canada) uses a nonproprietary 
automated analysis algorithm to interpret received oximetry 
data. Only the oxygen saturation signal (sampled at 1 Hz) is used 
to determine the monitor desaturation index (DI). The oximeter 
board uses an exponential filter to average the signal sent to the 
portable monitor. Specifically, the averaging calculation is based 
on a four-beat exponential average and an eight-beat sliding 
average for pulse rate. All averages are updated on a beat-by-beat 
basis. With the four-beat exponential average, the effect of each 
measurement gradually decreases beat by beat. Each measurement 
initially counts for one fourth of the average. This weight 
is decreased by multiplying three fourths on each succeeding 
beat: beat 1 . 
1/4 . 
0.250; beat 2 . 
3/4 . 
0.1875; beat 
3 . 
3/4 . 
0.1406; beat 4 . 
3/4 . 
0.1055 (and so on. . . this is an 
infinite series). The following calculation is then made on each 
valid beat: new average . 
old average . 
(new oxygen saturation 
– old average)/4; in other words, the new average value is the 
prior average plus one fourth the difference of the new saturation 
value from the prior average value. For pulse rates . 
112, the 4 
is replaced by an 8; for rates . 
225, the 8 becomes 16. 

The SnoreSat algorithm sequentially scans each recorded 
oxygen saturation value, and whenever a drop in a sampled 
oxygen saturation value is detected, the program assigns an event 
marker to that reading. When an increase in oxygen saturation is 
detected, the program determines if at least three consecutive 
event markers (ie, three consecutive drops in recorded oxygen 
saturation readings) were present prior to this rise. If this 
criterion is met and if the lowest oxygen saturation value is . 
3% 
lower than the baseline oxygen saturation, then a respiratory

disturbance is recorded. Baseline saturation was calculated as a 
moving time average, defined as the mean of the top fifth 
percentile of oxygen saturation values over the 5 min preceding 
the event. The DI is calculated by dividing the total number of 
respiratory disturbances by the total monitor “probe-on” time. 
Probe-on time is the total time the oximeter reports a valid 
oxygen signal. Although the automated analysis algorithm is not 
able to detect arousals from sleep, this did not affect the 
sensitivity and specificity of the monitor when compared with 
polysomnography in a large group of adults with OSA.6 

Data Analysis 

Agreement between the polysomnography-derived AHI and 
the simultaneously recorded portable monitor-generated DI was 
examined using the technique described by Bland and Altman.12 
The analysis compared results obtained using the new measurement 
technique (portable monitor) with the established one 
(polysomnography) by calculating the mean of the differences 
between the two measurements and then plotting the means 
against the average value. The mean and limits of agreement 
(95th confidence intervals) were calculated to identify how tightly 
and consistently the two techniques agreed within the full 
spectrum of disease. For example, a mean difference of . 
1 with 
ninety-fifth confidence intervals of . 
1.5 and . 
1.5 would describe 
very close agreement with little systematic bias. Agreement 
between the DI reported for nights 1 and 2 of the home SnoreSat 
study was examined as well as the agreement between the DI 
reported during the laboratory SnoreSat study and the mean of 
the two home studies using the Bland-Altman analysis (Stat 
Version 6.0; Stata Corporation; College Station, TX). This analysis 
technique was used to ensure accurate interpretation of the 
relationship between these two measurement tools, and is superior 
to simple correlation calculations when comparing a new tool 
to a standard testing technique, particularly when a range of test 
results is anticipated. 

Sensitivity and specificity of the portable monitor for the 
identification of polysomnography-proven OSA (AHI . 
1/h) 
were calculated. Receiver operator curves were generated by 
calculating the sensitivity and specificity of the portable monitor 
using specific DI case designations (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, and 10.0 
events per hour). This analysis allows for identification of the 
optimal case designation DI: the DI at which the monitor 
displays the highest sensitivity and specificity. This analysis was 
also performed for the identification of polysomnography-proven 
moderate OSA (AHI . 
5/h) in order to determine if the portable 
monitor would be more sensitive and/or specific for identifying 
more severely affected children. 

Results 

During the enrollment period, a total of 58 children 
(32 boys) met inclusion criteria and were 

enrolled into the study. Complete data were available 
for 57 children, indicating that is was feasible to 
obtain data without a technician present. One subject 
withdrew after having difficulty sleeping with 
the portable monitor at home during the first of 3 
study nights. Seven children were . 
13 years old 
(three boys). The remaining subjects were evenly 
distributed between 4 years and 7 years of age 
(n . 
25, 13 boys) and 8 to 12 years of age (n . 
26, 16 
boys). The prevalence of OSA was 79%. Polysomnography 
results are summarized in Table 3. Forty-
six percent (n . 
27) had moderate OSA with a mean 
AHI of 14.4/h and a mean oxygen saturation nadir of 
84.6%. End-tidal carbon dioxide maximal and mean 
levels were slightly elevated in all groups; however, 
the range of maximal values was higher in the 
children with OSA. 

Measures of Agreement 

The polysomnography-derived AHI and the oximetry-
based monitor-derived DI showed poor agreement 
(Fig 1). The means and limits of agreement 
between AHI and DI were dependent on the AHI 
cutoff points and were much tighter for the subgroup 
of patients with an AHI . 
10/h (mean, . 
0.37; limits 
of agreement, . 
9.17 to 8.43). Visual inspection of 
the Bland and Altman plot indicates that clinically 
significant differences between portable monitor DI 
and polysomnography-derived AHI occurred at all 
AHI values with a systematic bias noted at higher 
AHI values. The portable monitor consistently underestimated 
the frequency of respiratory events at 
higher AHI values (Fig 1). The Bland and Altman 
analysis of the portable monitor used in the laboratory 
compared with values obtained when used in 
the home demonstrated good agreement with no 
systematic bias regardless of what night of home 
study was used for the comparison (Fig 2). Similar 
results were obtained by analyzing night-to-night 
results of portable monitoring in the home, indicating 
good repeatability of the monitor (Fig 3). 

The sensitivity and specificity of the SnoreSat 
device depended on the DI case designation criterion 
values chosen for diagnosing OSA. Receiver 
operator curves (Fig 4) demonstrate the effect of

as normal, and 12 normal children (polysomnography 
AHI . 
1.0) as having moderate OSA (ie, false-
negative rate of 33%, false-positive rate of 40%). 

The means of the differences between AHI and 
DI was large. Visual inspection of the Bland and 
Altman plot would suggest that systematic bias occurs 
at both lower and higher AHI values (overestimation 
by the portable monitor at low levels, and 
underestimation at high levels). The sensitivity and 
specificity of the oximeter depended on the DI case 
designation criterion values chosen for diagnosing 
OSA (Table 3). At a DI and AHI cutoff value of 

. 
5/h, the automated analysis algorithm had a sensitivity 
of only 67% and a specificity of only 68%. The 
algorithm missed a diagnosis of moderate OSA (AHI 
. 
5/h; range, 5.6 to 27.2/h) in 8 children (falsenegative 
rate of 14%) and misdiagnosed moderate 
OSA in 13 children (false-positive rate of 22%). 
In all but one case, complete data were obtained 
from the home studies, indicating excellent feasibility 
of home monitoring for children. The algorithm 
showed remarkable consistency between home and 
laboratory (Fig 2, r . 
0.86). There was little nightto-
night variability as well (Fig 3, r . 
0.83). 

Discussion 

Despite excellent feasibility and repeatability of 
the SnoreSat monitor used in the home, poor agreement 
with the reference standard diagnostic test for 


Figure 4. Receiver operator curves (ROCs) illustrating sensitivity 
and specificity of the portable monitor for identifying (top, a) 
all children with OSA (laboratory polysomnography AHI .

and (bottom, b) with moderate-to-severe OSA (laboratory polysomnography 
AHI . 
5/h). Sensitivity and specificity were the 
same for DI values of 0.5 and 1 (100% and 0, respectively) and 
are shown as a single point (top, a). 

OSA in children was found. Although our data 
confirm that home monitoring without sleep technicians 
is feasible, the results obtained with the portable 
monitor did not agree sufficiently with standard 
testing to advocate for indiscriminate home oximetry 
testing as an alternative to laboratory polysomnography. 
The repeatability of the portable monitor from 
night to night and between home and laboratory 
settings confirms a systematic error with respect to 
identifying OSA in children. 

Obstructive respiratory events are uncommon in 
children and are generally considered significant if 
present at a frequency of . 
1/h.11 A cutoff point of 
five events per hour should clearly identify children 
with moderate abnormalities; that is, children most 
likely at increased risk of adverse outcomes. The 
portable monitor had poor sensitivity and specificity 
for identifying this group of children, even when 
analyzed with various DI cutoff points (Figs 3, 4). 
The discrepancy between our results and those 
reported by Vazquez et al6 highlights the dissimilarity 
between adults with OSA and children with OSA. 

There are important differences in the physiology 

1706 Clinical Investigations

and pathophysiology of sleep and OSA in children 
that may impact our ability to obtain equivalent 
accuracy with identical technological devices used 
for adults. Firstly, the cutoffs for clinically significant 
OSA in adults are much higher, thus eliminating the 
need for discrimination between what may be considered 
low and very low AHI values. Children with 
OSA also frequently display prolonged episodes of 
partial upper airway obstruction without discreet 
abrupt desaturations.1,13 These episodes may be 
missed completely by oximetry-based testing due to 
the omission of ventilatory parameters such as end-
tidal carbon dioxide or transcutaneous carbon dioxide 
monitoring and measurements of chest and 
abdominal wall motion. 

Lastly, children are notably more restless during 
sleep, and those with OSA have been shown to have 
significantly more movement arousals than age-
matched control subjects, increasing oximetry movement 
artifact signals. Scholle and Zwacka14 reported 
a mean of 20.4 movement arousals per hour in a 
group of untreated children with OSA.14 Movements 
also occur in response to airway obstruction or partial 
obstruction, further increasing the potential for 
movement artifact, which may be associated with low 
saturation recordings. 

Inaccurate data can be identified and eliminated 
during the standard manual scoring procedure for 
laboratory polysomnography based on inspection of 
the data and inclusion of the pulse waveform variability 
into the determination of “bad data” or movement 
artifact. This likely explains some of the discrepancy 
between our findings and those published 
by Brouillette et al.4 Although using artifact-free 
recording time would be expected to reduce the 
overall DI in children, Urschitz et al5 reported that 
drops in oxygen saturation were actually quite common 
(mean, 1.2/h; 95th percentile, 3.9/h) in their 
population of 90 unselected children.5 They speculate 
that the increased frequency of desaturation 
during sleep in their population compared with the 
previously published normative data on children may 
be due to the more restricted age range, stricter 
definition of a desaturation event (. 
4% vs . 
4%), 
or the different monitoring setting.11 Unlike the 
study by Brouillette et al,4 artifact-free time was not 
identified manually but by data analysis software 
provided by the device manufacturer, raising 
the possibility of underestimation of artifact-free 
recordings. 

Although ambulatory monitoring for the diagnosis 
of OSA in children has not been validated, many 
clinicians and researchers have adopted this method 
of diagnosis and are reporting outcomes and associations 
based on the results of ambulatory monitoring.
15–17 We were able to identify only two prior 

www.chestjournal.org 

studies in which home studies were compared with 
lab polysomnography results in children. Goodwin et 
al17 performed 157 unattended polysomnographic 
home studies in a self-selected group of school 
children in order to identify the prevalence of sleep-
disordered breathing in their population. Only 5 of 
the 157 children underwent laboratory studies, and 
all were performed “within 7 weeks” of the home 
study; no significant differences were seen.17 A 
similar design was employed by Jacob et al,3 who 
studied 21 young children in the home and in the 
laboratory. In both of these studies, the home studies 
were almost identical to the laboratory studies, and 
technicians went to the homes to set up equipment 
and make additional measurements and observations. 
Although good correlation was reported by 
both groups of investigators, these studies are not 
comparable to the ambulatory monitoring frequently 
done on a research and clinical basis employing 
unobserved, ambulatory monitoring with limited 
channels. 

Several milestone publications15,16,18,19 relating 
epidemiologic data, behavioral and cognitive associations, 
and outcomes data of OSA in children are 
based only on abbreviated, ambulatory monitoring 
techniques. Given the importance of these reported 
associations and the potential effect on changes in 
clinical care recommendations, it is imperative that 
these findings be confirmed using validated instruments 
before adopting changes in medical practice. 
Our findings suggest that, contrary to the recent 
American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines,20 even a 
positive abbreviated test result in a child with symptoms 
of OSA may need to be viewed with some 
skepticism, as the false-positive rate was unacceptably 
high in our study population. 

Interpretation of data that are obtained using 
inaccurate measurement tools is obviously hazardous, 
particularly if changes in medical management 
or recommendations are affected. For example, evidence 
supports a correlation between preoperative 
polysomnography indexes and perioperative complications 
in children undergoing adenotonsillectomy 
for OSA. In a population of 349 children undergoing 
adenotonsillectomy, Wilson et al21 reported an increased 
risk of postoperative respiratory complications 
(odds ratio, 7.2) for children with a polysomnography 
AHI . 
5/h.21 Clearly, if perioperative 
morbidity can be predicted based on polysomnography 
parameters, the agreement between ambulatory 
monitors and laboratory polysomnography in children 
must be confirmed before ambulatory monitoring 
can replace laboratory polysomnography as a 
preoperative assessment tool. 

There are a few limitations to this study that may 
have impacted our results. The oximeter calculated

events based on probe-on time and not artifact-free 
time. This may explain some of the disagreement 
with laboratory polysomnography during which manual 
inspection of the pulse waveform signal is used to 
identify artifact-free time. Although unselected, otherwise 
healthy children were enrolled, they may not 
accurately represent the typical pediatric population 
undergoing evaluation for OSA. Our sleep service is 
located at a tertiary level institution and offers the 
only access to complete pediatric diagnostic sleep 
facilities in Western Canada. 

Although laboratory polysomnography is the accepted 
“gold standard” test, there are currently no 
scientific data correlating polysomnography indexes 
to adverse clinical medical outcomes in children. 
Even among the abundant adult sleep apnea literature, 
there is no conclusive evidence that the risks of 
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications 
are related to specific polysomnographic measurements 
or that treatment of OSA results in improvement 
of these medical complications.22 Given this 
limitation of our “gold standard” measurement tool, 
comparison of polysomnography indexes with the 
portable oximetry determined respiratory disturbance 
indexes (RDIs) may not be the optimal approach 
to validation of a home monitor. Clinically, 
decisions regarding treatment of children with OSA 
are based on a combination of factors, including the 
daytime behavioral and learning problems experienced 
and reported by the child, parents, and teachers, 
as well as the results of diagnostic testing. 

Clearly, simple oximetry measurements, with or 
without motion sensitivity, cannot replace laboratory 
polysomnography, given the poor sensitivity. Perhaps 
use of a motion-sensitive oximeter in association with 
some measure of airflow and respiratory effort will 
improve on both the sensitivity and specificity for 
identifying children with OSA, yet still allow for 
ambulatory monitoring to replace polysomnography 
in otherwise healthy children. Given the differences 
between adults and children with OSA, one cannot 
assume that diagnostic instruments previously validated 
in an adult population are equally as accurate 
when used in children.
