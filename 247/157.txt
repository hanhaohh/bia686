Introduction 

Adenotonsillar hypertrophy (ATH) is the most common 
cause of upper airway obstruction and 
obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome in children 
[1]. Mechanical airway obstruction due to ATH may 
lead to cardiopulmonary complications associated 
with hypercarbia, hypoxemia and pulmonary artery 
vasoconstriction [2, 3]. In the severe form, ATH can 
lead to right ventricular failure, cor pulmonale, 
growth retardation, or even to death [1–6]. 

The myocardial performance index (MPI or Tei 
index) is a non-invasive Doppler measurement of 
global ventricular function that incorporates both 
systolic and diastolic functions and may be applied to 
the right ventricle (RV) or left ventricle (LV). The 
index can be easily measured by routine Doppler 
techniques during a standard echocardiographic 
examination with high reproducibility and is important 
in the assessment of global RV performance [7, 
8]. The MPI has been shown to correlate significantly 
with other invasive or non-invasive measures of RV 
function [9–11]. This index has been previously used 
to assess cardiac function in a variety of clinical 
conditions including pulmonary hypertension, cardiomyopathy 
and complex congenital heart disease 
[8, 12, 13]. Recent studies demonstrated that ATH 
causes higher mean pulmonary artery pressure and 
increased right ventricular end diastolic diameter, 
which may improve postoperatively [14, 15]. However, 
global right and left ventricular functions in 
ATH has not been studied yet. 

The aim of this study is to determine the clinical 
value of RV MPI in children with advanced stage 
(grade 3 or 4) ATH and to clarify whether adenotonsillectomy 
has any effect on MPI of these children. 

Material and methods 

The study consisted of 21 children with grade 3 or 
grade 4 ATH (13 male, aged 7.3 ± 1.8 years) and 21 
control subjects (14 male, aged 7.2 ± 2.2 years). All 
the patients and/or their parents had complaints of 
snoring, mouth breathing and pausing of breathe 
during sleep at least 6 months. Tonsillar hypertrophy 
was graded according to Brodsky scale [16]as 
follows: Grade 1: tonsils were in the tonsillar fossa, 
barely visible behind the anterior pillars; Grade 2: 

tonsils were easily visible behind the anterior pillars; 
Grade 3: tonsils extended three-quarters of the way to 
the midline; and Grade 4: tonsils were completely 
obstructing the airway. Adenoid hypertrophy was 
graded according to severity of the airway obstruction: 
Grade 1: indicates \25%; Grade 2: indicates 
25–50%; Grade 3: indicates 50–75%; and Grade 4: 
indicates [75% obstruction. It is so difficult to 
determine the duration of ATH exactly. Therefore 
possible duration of ATH was defined as the known 
duration of adenotonsillar enlargement when the 
study was started. Children with upper airway 
obstruction due to other causes such as recent upper 
respiratory tract infection or ongoing infection, 
allergic rhinitis, grade 1 and grade 2 ATH, head 
and neck malformation and known or suspected 
cardiovascular disease were excluded from the study. 

Control subjects were selected among the children, 
who admitted to our outpatient clinic with no 
adenotonsillar disease, upper and lower respiratory 
tract infection and obstruction. 

Parents completed questionnaires the quality of life 
in children with obstructive sleep disorder questionnaire 
for the quantitative assessment of the quality of 
life in children with advanced stage of ATH, parents 
were asked to fill a questionnaire (OSA-18) [17]. 

It has been well-known that the OSA-18 have a 
high level of test–retest reliability, validity, and 
responsiveness in OSA syndrome and has also shown 
validity for detecting change and evaluating quality 
of life after adenotonsillectomy in children with OSA 
syndrome [17–19]. This instrument, which contains 
an 18-item quality of life survey, was filled out by 
parents on a 7-point scale from ‘‘none’’ to ‘‘all of the 
time’’. The items coversleep disturbance, physical 
suffering, emotional distress, daytime problems, 
caregiver concerns and total quality of life. 

The study was approved by the Local Ethics 
Committee and the child’s agreement and parental 
consent were obtained. All subjects underwent adenotonsillectomy 
and Doppler echocardiographic measurements 
were repeated 7.3 ± 2.0 months postoperatively.

available ultrasound instruments (SIM 7000 CFM 
Challenge; ESAOTE Ultrasound, Florence, Italy) 
were performed on all patients and control subjects. 
Studies were performed by a single experienced 
operator who was blinded to patients’ names and 
diagnoses. Calculation of the RV MPI was showed in 
Fig. 1. Interval ‘‘a’’ is measured between cessation 
and onset of tricuspid inflow and is equal to the sum 
of the right ventricular isovolumic activity isovolumic 
contraction time (ICT), ventricular ejection time 
(ET) and isovlumic relaxation time (IRT). Interval 
‘‘b’’ (right ventricular ET) is measured from the 
beginning to the end of the RV outflow velocity trace. 
The MPI is defined as the sum of ICT and IRT 
divided by ET (a–b/b) [11]. Because interrogation of 
the tricuspid valve inflow and the RV outflow is 
obtained from different echocardiographic views, 
care was taken to select traces with R–R intervals 
within 5% in duration from each other. LV MPI was 
calculated by measuring ICT and IRT from an apical 
4-chamber view that displayed the mitral valve 
inflow and LV outflow during the same cardiac 
cycle. Five consecutive beats were measured and 
averaged for each measurement. 

Mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) was 
calculated from the echocardiographic records of the 
pulmonary flow trace using the Mahan formula 
(mPAP [mmhg] = 79 – (0.62 · Act); Act: Acceleration 
time of the pulmonary flow trace is the time 
interval between the beginning of the flow and its 
peak velocity [20]. Echocardiographic systolic PAP

(from onset of isovolumic 
contraction to onset of 
diastolic filling) was 
determined from tricuspid 
inflow trace (left). Interval 
‘‘b’’ (systolic ejection time) 
was measured from RV 
outflow trace (right) 

was calculated from the tricuspid regurgitation 
velocity [21]. Tricuspid regurgitation of measurable 
quality was recorded in 16 (76%) of patients group 
and in 13 (62%) control group. 

A simultaneous electrocardiogram was obtained in 
all patients. Doppler signals were recorded with a 
strip chart at a paper speed of 50 or 100 mm/s and 
with .75-in videotape. To prevent possible influence 
of respiratory and cardiac cycle on measurements, the 
average of five consecutive Doppler flow traces was 
calculated for each parameter. 

Twenty random Doppler recordings were analyzed 
to determine the inter-and intraobserver variability in 
measurement of the MPI. The mean intraobserver 
variability in the measurement of the MPI was 2.8%. 

Statistical analysis 

The results were analyzed with the SPSS (statistical 
package for social sciences) computer program. 
Continuous variables are presented as mean ± SD. 
The qualitative values were compared by v 2-test, the 
significance of difference quantitative values of pre-
and post-operative groups were estimated by means 
of independent paired-sample t-test. Correlation 
between RV MPI and mPAP, age, heart rate, body 
surface area and symptom score were determined by 
linear regression analysis. A P value \ .05 was 
considered significant.

Results 

The clinical characteristics of the study population 
are summarized in Table 1. Patients with ATH had 
significantly prolonged sum of ICT and IRT, shortened 
ET, resulting in significantly increased RV MPI, 
whereas LV MPI was not different in two groups. 
The mPAP and the systolic PAP of the ATH group 
were significantly higher compared to healthy controls 
(23.8 ± 5.1 vs. 15.4 ± 4.7 mmhg, P \ .005 and 

44.2 ± 9.4 mmhg vs. 25.0 ± 8.9 mmhg, P \ .01 
respectively) (Table 1). 
Figure 2 shows the relationship of mPAP and RV 
MPI preoperatively. There was a strong positive 
correlation between the two variables (r = 0.71; 
P \ .005). The RV MPI was also correlated with 
the OSA-18 survey score (r = 0.64; P \ .01) (Fig. 3). 
There was no statistically significant correlation 
between the RV MPI and age, heart rate, duration 
of ATH, or body surface area of patients group.

Discussion 

This is the first study evaluating the clinical value of 
Doppler-derived MPI in children with ATH. We 
found that RV MPI as an echocardiographic parameter 
summarizing right ventricular function was 
significantly increased in pediatric patients with 
grade 3 and 4 ATH without evident cardiovascular

index (RV MPI) in control, preoperative and 
postoperative ATH groups 

disease compared with age-matched control subjects. 
We also showed a significant improvement in RV 
MPI in these children postoperatively. 

ATH is the most common cause of upper air-way 
obstruction in pediatric population. Chronic upper 
airway obstruction often presents with evidence of 
OSA syndrome; in severe cases these children may 
also present with pulmonary hypertension and cor 
pulmonale. The development of pulmonary hypertension 
and right heart dysfunction from chronic 
upper airway obstruction is complex. Hypoxemia and 
hypercarbia-induced respiratory acidosis are potent 
mediators of pulmonary vasoconstriction that can 
lead to reversible or irreversible chronic changes in 
the pulmonary vasculature. It is likely that production 
of various neurohumoral factors in response to 
hypoxemia and respiratory distress may further 
promote pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular 
dysfunction, and consequent impairment of systemic 
cardiac output [22, 23]. The symptoms of progressive 
pulmonary hypertension are minimal until the rapid 
onset of severe cardiac decompensation occurs. 
Therefore, early detection of subclinical cardiac 
impairment may be a crucial for the decision of 
early surgical approach. Eventually, a reliable, noninvasive, 
and simple method is needed to evaluate 
those patients. 

Previous studies demonstrate that non-invasively 
measured systolic PAP was significantly higher in 
patients with ATH [14, 15]. In agreement with these 
studies, we demonstrated that the systolic PAP was 
significantly increased in patients with ATH compared 
to controls. We also calculated mPAP using the 
pulmonary acceleration time. In present study, mPAP 
but not systolic PAP was included in linear regression 
analysis to evaluate the correlation between RV MPI 
and the other variables. A previous study reported 
that the right-sided heart pressures could be obtained 
using the tricuspid regurgitation in approximately 
86% of non-selected patients by the designated 
cardiologist [24], however, in our study, tricuspid 
regurgitation was of measurable quality in only 16 
(76%) of the patients group and in 13 (62%) of the 
control group. So, both the small sample size of our 
study and the low number of patients with measurable 
tricuspid regurgitation could not allowed us to use 
systolic PAP in this regression analysis. Moreover, 
Chan et al. compared the three Doppler ultrasound 
methods (systolic transtricuspid gradient, pulmonary

acceleration time and right ventricular isovolumic 
relaxation time) in the prediction of pulmonary artery 
pressure [25]. Among the three methods, despite the 
fact that the tricuspid gradient measurement seems to 
be useful and practical, the pulmonary acceleration 
time method in prediction of pulmonary artery 
pressure was satisfactory (r = 0.85) when patients 
with heart rate between 60 and 100 beats/min were 
considered. Starting out of this point, heart rates of 
the majority of the patients and controls in our study 
were between 60 and 100 beats/min (81% in the 
patients group and 90% in the control group). 
Therefore, using the pulmonary acceleration time 
method for the measurement of pulmonary artery 
pressure in present study might not cause any 
important limitation. 

In present study, we also evaluated global right 
ventricular function using the new noninvasive Doppler-
derived myocardial performance index which was 
proposed by Tei et al [14, 15]. The subjects with ATH 
had significantly higher RV MPI than the controls 
despite the fact that they had no clinically evident 
cardiovascular disease, which suggests subclinical RV 
dysfunction may occur in ATH. Currently, there are no 
parameters of global RV function that can be easily 
measured. Contrast right ventriculography has been the 
gold standard used to assess RV function. However, 
this method requires invasive techniques and geometric 
assumption to assess RV volume. Therefore, this 
method has limited use in patients with complicated 
RV shape due to congenital heart disease. Magnetic 
resonance imaging and three-dimensional transthoracic 
echocardiography are well-validated tecniques for the 
determination of right ventricular volume and ejection 
fraction, but in daily clinical practice, high cost and 
difficulty in doing the exam preclude their use [26]. 
Transthoracic two-dimensional echocardiography is 
most widely used for evaluating RV systolic function, 
but it depends on the assumptions of RV geometry, 
and thus may not hold true in cases of abnormally 
shaped right ventricles. Although transtricuspid inflow 
velocities and the velocity ratio have proved to be 
useful indicators for the evaluation of right ventricular 
function, the velocities are not widely used in children 
with tachycardia because of the merging of E and A 
velocities to various degrees, which are affected by 
loading conditions and heart rate [27, 28]. However 
the Tei index has been reported to be independent of 
heart rate and blood pressure [29]. Most importantly, 

123 


previous studies also demonstrated the clinical value of 
MPI in identifying early RV impairment in different 
diseases [30, 31]. Therefore, echocardiographic monitoring 
of these patients with RV MPI may be more 
advantageous over the echocardiographic and other 
noninvasive imaging methods. 

In present study, upper airway obstructive symptoms 
were assessed by a questionnaire (OSA-18). 
Patients with OSA-18 survey score ‡70 were identified 
as those having severe obstructive symptoms 
(n = 13). These patients had a higher RV MPI and 
mPAP when compared with the patients having 
symptom scores \70 (n = 8), which implied mild 
obstructive symptoms. These findings confirm that 
severe upper airway obstruction may play an important 
pathophysiological role in the development of 
pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular 
dysfunction. 

Recent studies showed that the cardiorespiratory 
disturbances due to ATH may be reversed by 
adenotonsillectomy [14, 15, 22]. In our study, the 
right ventricular functions and obstructive symptom 
scores of patients were significantly improved postoperatively. 
Based on these findings and previous 
studies, we suggest that the pathological changes in 
cardiorespiratory system are reversible and adenotonsillectomy 
is an effective therapeutic measure in 
patients with grade 3 and grade 4 ATH. 

The primary limitation of this study is the small 
size of the study group. However, our population was 
composed of highly selected children with advanced 
stage of ATH. Another limitation, the upper airway 
obstruction symptoms were evaluated qualitatively 
using the OSA-18 survey score. The gold standard for 
the assesment of the presence and severity of 
obstructive symptoms is polysomnographic study 
[32]. However, it was reported that OSA-18 is a 
practical and reliable method and has shown validity 
for detecting change and evaluating quality of 
life after adenotonsillectomy in children with OSA 
[17–19]. 

In conclusion, present study demonstrates that 
grade 3 and grade 4 ATH causes increased RV MPI, 
which reflects subclinical RV dysfunction and surgical 
intervention by adenotonsillectomy may reverse 
these cardiac changes. Larger clinical studies are 
needed to investigate the clinical use of MPI measurements 
in monitoring the right ventricular function 
in patient with ATH.
