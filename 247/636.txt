Evaluation of sleep-disordered breathing in children 

HAN SOHN, MD, and RICHARD M. ROSENFELD, MD, MPH, Brooklyn, New York 

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated changes in disease-specific 
quality of life (QOL) for children with sleep-
disordered breathing (SDB). 
PATIENTS, DESIGN, AND SETTING: We conducted a 
cohort study in 69 children (age range, 6 months to 
13 years; median age, 6.1 years) from a hospital-
based pediatric otolaryngology practice in a metropolitan 
area. We used the OSA-18, an 18-item 
QOL survey with known test-retest reliability, internal 
consistency, and construct validity. Survey domains 
included sleep disturbance, physical suffering, 
emotional distress, daytime problems, and 
caregiver concerns. 
INTERVENTION: Tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy 
was performed as part of routine clinical care. The 
OSA-18 was completed at entry by the child’s caregiver 
and again at least 4 weeks after surgery. 
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The validity of the 
OSA-18 change score was assessed by comparison 
with multiple external constructs, including a 
validated measure of longitudinal change (OSD-6 
survey). Responsiveness was assessed by the standardized 
response mean (SRM). 
RESULTS: The mean baseline OSA-18 survey score 
was 3.1 (SD, 0.9) of a maximum 7.0, with higher 
values indicating poorer QOL. Change scores were 
available for all children, with a mean interval between 
preoperative and postoperative surveys of 
61 days (range, 42 to 92 days). The mean OSA-18 
change score of 1.14 (SD, 0.71) showed significant 
correlation with tonsil size (r . 
0.40), adenoid size 
(r . 
0.31), OSD-6 change scores (r . 
0.71), and the 
direct caregiver estimates of change (r . 
0.34). 
OSA-18 change scores showed large responsiveness 
to change (SRM 1.44; 95% confidence interval,

sleep disturbance, physical suffering, and caregiver 
concerns. Significant responsiveness was also 
demonstrated for the domains of daytime problems 
and emotional distress. 
CONCLUSIONS: The OSA-18 is a valid, reliable, and 
responsive QOL measure that combines the advantages 
of a discriminative and evaluative survey in a 
single instrument. The OSA-18 is a useful measure of 
patient-based outcomes for clinical trials, health 
services research, and routine clinical care. 
(Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg 2003;128:344-52.) 

Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) caused by 
enlarged tonsils or adenoids is common in early 
childhood.1 The characteristic feature of SDB is 
habitual snoring, which may or may not be 
associated with abnormal gas exchange. SDB 
without alterations in alveolar ventilation or 
sleep architecture is called primary snoring and 
affects up to 12% of young children. In contrast, 
SDB with associated apneas or hypopneas affects 
between 1% and 3% of children and is 
called obstructive sleep apnea syndrome 
(OSAS).2 Because OSAS and primary snoring 
cannot be distinguished without polysomnography,
3 the broader term SDB is more relevant for 
everyday clinical practice. 

SDB is an increasingly common indication for 
tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy (T&A).4 Despite 
the large number of patients undergoing surgery, 
the ability to assess patient-based outcomes 
is limited. Change within patients is best measured 
using an evaluative survey, administered before 
and after an intervention or period of observation. 
The only existing evaluative instrument for obstructive 
sleep disorders, the OSD-6, was not validated 
against polysomnography and has unknown 
discriminative ability.5 In contrast, a discriminative 
survey measures differences between patients 
at a single point in time. We previously validated 
the OSA-18 survey as a discriminative instrument 
using polysomnography, but the evaluative properties 
are unknown.6 An evaluative survey is 
needed, however, because SDB has a large impact 
on global and disease-specific QOL.6,7

The purpose of our investigation was to validate 
the OSA-18 as a measure of longitudinal 
change in disease-specific quality of life (QOL) 
for children with SDB of sufficient severity to 
warrant intervention. Changes in QOL are important 
to clinicians and patients because they 
measure perceived effectiveness. Evaluative 
surveys have been used successfully to measure 
QOL changes after tympanostomy tube insertion 
for children with chronic or recurrent otitis 
media and to classify these changes as trivial, 
small, moderate, or large.8 A similar measure 
for SDB would permit rapid evaluation of QOL 
changes in individuals undergoing medical or 
surgical interventions. Further, validating the 
OSA-18 as a measure of change within individuals 
would provide clinicians with a single instrument 
that possessed both discriminative and 
evaluative properties. 

METHODS 

This prospective, observational study was approved 
by the institutional review board of the 
Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn, New 
York. A consecutive sample of patients was 
recruited from July 1, 1999, through December 
31, 1999. A sample size of 68 subjects was 
needed to detect a moderate effect size (standardized 
response mean [SRM]) assuming an . 
of 0.05 and . 
of 0.20.9 This size would also 
permit detection of a population correlation as 
low as 0.30, which was adequate for the anticipated 
levels in this study. 

Specific inclusion criteria were age 6 months 
through 12 years, inclusive; history of snoring and 
disrupted sleep for 3 months or longer; and scheduled 
for tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, or T&A as 
part of routine clinical care. Specific exclusion 
criteria were prior tonsil or adenoid surgery; 
Down or other syndrome involving the head and 
neck; neuromuscular disorders; cleft palate or previous 
pharyngeal surgery; known cognitive deficit 
or mental retardation; known psychiatric disorder; 
or inability of caregiver to read and understand 
English. To ensure that at least some children 
studied would have small or trivial changes in 
SDB-related QOL after surgery, we also sought to 
include 15 to 20 children undergoing tonsil or 
adenoid surgery for recurrent infection. 

SOHN and ROSENFELD 345 

The primary outcome measure was the 
OSA-18 survey (Fig a), a valid and reliable 
discriminative QOL measure for children with 
varying levels of SDB.6 The OSA-18 has been 
previously shown to possess satisfactory test-
retest reliability and internal consistency.6 The 
survey consists of 18 items grouped into 5 domains: 
sleep disturbance (4 items), physical suffering 
(4 items), emotional distress (3 items), 
daytime problems (3 items), and caregiver concerns 
(4 items). Items are scored on a 7-point 
ordinal scale and have excellent test-retest reliability 
(R . 
0.74). The overall survey score is 
calculated as the mean of the 18 items, which 
correlates significantly with the respiratory distress 
index (R . 
0.43) and adenoid size (R . 
0.43). The OSA-18 also provides a direct global 
rating of SDB-related QOL via a 10-point visual 
analogue scale with specific semantic anchors. 

Data were collected at 2 consecutive times 
(from the same caregiver) during the routine 
care of a child scheduled for surgery meeting 
the above criteria: the day of surgery (visit 1) 
and approximately 2 to 4 months later (visit 2). 
At visit 1 the caregiver completed the OSA-18 
survey,6 OSD-6 survey,5 and a 3-item questionnaire 
used to calculate an OSAS score based on 
a discriminant function described by Brouilette 
et al.10 The discriminant function ranks the 
probability of OSAS for a given child as low, 
intermediate, or high. Tonsil size was categorized 
from 1. 
to 4. 
using standard criteria,11 
and adenoid size was also categorized on a 
4-point scale based on the degree of choanal 
obstruction observed at surgery.6 

At visit 2 the parent or caregiver who provided 
information at visit 1 completed a second 
OSA-18 survey, second OSD-6 survey, and a 
change assessment form. The change assessment 
form provided a direct caregiver estimate 
of longitudinal change using a 7-point scale 
described by Juniper and colleagues.12 A response 
of “no change” or “almost the same” 
indicated trivial change and was coded as zero. 
Otherwise, a value of 1 to 3 was assigned to the 
degree of reported change as follows: “a little” 
or “somewhat” indicated small change and was 
coded as 1; “moderately” or “a good deal” indicated 
moderate change and was coded as e; “a

great deal” or “a very great deal” indicated large 
change and was coded as 3. Improvement was 
coded as a positive value, and worsening was 
coded as a negative value. The direct caregiver 
estimate of change, therefore, ranged from 3 
to 3 in integer increments. 

Validity of the OSA-18 as a measure of longitudinal 
change was determined using the change 
score, calculated by subtracting the mean survey 
score at visit 2 from the mean score at visit 1. The 
OSA-18 change score was correlated with 3 external 
construct measures: (1) direct caregiver estimate 
of change, (2) OSD-6 change score, and (3) 
global change score from the OSA-18 visual analogue 
scale. Data from other evaluative surveys 
with 7-point response scales suggest that change 
scores of 0.5 indicate trivial change, 0.5 to 0.9 
indicate small change, 1.0 to 1.4 indicate moderate 
change, and 1.5 indicate large change.8,12 

Responsiveness to longitudinal change was also 
assessed using the SRM, defined as the change 
score divided by its standard deviation. As a measure 
of effect size, the SRM describes signal-tonoise 
ratio.13 Ideally, the signal (variations in the 
change score caused by true change) should be 
high relative to the noise (variations in the change 
score caused by random error). Because SRMs are 
ideally determined before and after an intervention 
of known efficacy, only the change scores for 
patients undergoing surgery for a primary indication 
of SDB were included for this part of the 
analysis. SRMs were determined for the OSA-18 
overall score, domain score, and individual items. 
The OSA-18 overall score SRM was correlated 
with the SRM for the OSD-6 as a further validity 
assessment. 

Data entry was performed using a microcomputer 
database and verified for 100% accuracy. All 
statistical analyses were performed using True Epistat 
software.14 Pearson correlation was used to 
compare numerical data and a t test for comparison 
of the mean was used to determine the significance 
of change scores. A parametric approach 
was used because the data had a relatively symmetric 
distribution, with only trivial changes in 
results when nonparametric tests (Spearman rank 
correlation) were substituted. A 2-sided . 
level of 

0.05 was used for all hypothesis tests, and 95% 
SOHN and ROSENFELD 347 

confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for primary 
results when applicable. 

RESULTS 

Sixty-nine patients met eligibility criteria for 
the study. The median age was 6.1 years (range, 

1.4 to 13.1 years), with a 64% male predominance. 
The ethnic distribution was 64% white, 25% 
black, 10% Hispanic, and 1% Asian. Surveys were 
completed by the child’s mother (90%) or father 
(10%), with a high school (54%) or college level 
(46%) education. Fifty-four children (78%) had 
surgery for a primary indication of sleep-disordered 
breathing, while the remaining 15 children 
(22%) had recurrent or chronic infections as the 
primary surgical indication. 
Surgical procedures included 35 tonsillectomies 
and adenoidectomies (52%), 30 adenoidectomies 
alone (44%), and 3 tonsillectomies alone (4%). 
The degree of baseline oropharyngeal obstruction 
caused by the tonsils was 25% for 3 children 
(4%), between 26% and 50% for 32 children 
(47%), between 51% and 75% for 23 children 
(33%), and 75% for 11 children (16%). The 
degree of baseline nasopharyngeal obstruction 
caused by the adenoids was between 26% and 
50% for 15 children (22%), between 51% and 
75% for 30 children (43%), and 76% for 24 
children (35%). Study results were not stratified 
by the type of surgery performed (tonsillectomy 
versus adenoidectomy) because the outcome of 
interest was change in SDB, not the effectiveness 
of a specific surgical procedure. 

Preoperative responses for the OSA-18 survey 
are shown in Table 1. Sleep disturbance and physical 
suffering were the highest rated domains, followed 
by caregiver concerns, daytime problems, 
and emotional distress. A similar rank order was 
observed for the OSD-6 item responses listed in 
Table 2. The mean OSA-18 survey score was 3.1 
(SD, 0.9), which suggested the impact of SDB on 
QOL was small for 47 children (68%), moderate 
for 14 (20%), and large for 8 (12%). The mean 
Brouilette score10 was 0.68 (SD, 1.93), with 15 
children (22%) classified as low probability of 
obstructive sleep apnea, 50 (72%) as intermediate 
probability, and 4 (6)% as high probability. The 
mean global QOL rating on the OSA-18 was 5.2 
(SD, 2.0).

and 0.8, a large effect. 
change score did not correlate with change in the 
direct global QOL rating (r . 
0.21, P . 
0.082). 

There was fair correlation between the direct 
change estimate and the OSA-18 change score 
(r . 
0.34, P . 
0.005). Results (Table 3) are 
similar to other surveys with a 7-point response 
scale, with 0.5 to 1.0 suggesting a small clinical 
change and 1.0 suggesting a moderate or large 
change. The small number of children (n . 
5) 
having no change makes this result imprecise, but 
the mean value is consistent with other surveys. 
The OSA-18 change score showed fair correlation 
with baseline tonsil size (r . 
0.40, P . 
0.001) and 
adenoid size (r . 
0.31, P . 
0.009). In contrast, 
the OSD-6 change score showed poorer correlation 
with tonsil size (r . 
0.30, P . 
0.014) and did 
not correlate with adenoid size (r . 
0.18, P . 
0.129). 

Effect sizes for change in QOL after surgery 
(Table 4) suggest large responsiveness to change 
for the OSA-18 survey. The lower limit of the 
95% CI for the SRM also indicated large responsiveness 
for the domains of sleep disturbance, 
physical suffering, and caregiver concerns; daytime 
problems had moderate to large responsiveness, 
and emotional distress had small responsiveness 
(which was statistically significant). The 
OSD-6 survey also demonstrated large responsiveness 
to change (SRM, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.16 to 
1.69), but the SRM was slightly less than for the 
OSA-18 (SRM, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.32 to 1.89). 

The level of clinical change detected by the 
OSA-18 and OSD-6 can be categorized as trivial, 
small, moderate, and large (Table 5) using change 

score cut points of 0.50, 1.00, and 1.50. Thirty-six 
children (52%) had concordant change levels on 
both surveys, and 59 (86%) had scores on one 
survey within 1 level of the other survey. More 
children had large change as judged by the OSD-6 
(42%) than by the OSA-18 (22%); responses for 
trivial change were more consistent (17% versus 
20%). Overall, the OSA-18 produced a more 
evenly distributed range of response improvement 
than did the OSD-6. 

DISCUSSION 

Our study validates the OSA-18 as a measure of 
longitudinal change for children aged 1 to 12 years 
with SDB secondary to enlarged tonsils or adenoids. 
Clinicians and researchers can use the 
OSA-18 to categorize the baseline impact of SDB 
on QOL as small, moderate, or large (Table 6) and 
to quantify changes in QOL over time as trivial, 
small, moderate, or large (Table 6). The OSA-18 
is the only survey that has been validated as both 
a discriminative measure of SDB severity among 
individuals, and as an evaluative measure of longitudinal 
change in SDB status. Discrimination 
and evaluation are distinct survey properties that 
require separate validation and assessment.15 The 
OSA-18 was previously validated as a discriminative 
measure,6 and the present study validates the 
survey’s responsiveness. 

Other QOL measures exist for children with 
adenotonsillar disease. Stewart16 validated a 15item 
survey for tonsil and adenoid morbidity, including 
recurrent infection, but change in children 
with SDB was not specifically addressed. In con

Table 6. How to administer, score, and interpret 
the OSA-18 quality of life survey 

1. The target population is otherwise healthy children 
aged 6 months to 12 years with sleep-disordered 
breathing, manifest by primary snoring or 
obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. 
2. The child’s parent or caregiver completes the 
OSA-18 at baseline. Item responses are totaled to 
produce a severity score ranging from 18 (best 
QOL) to 126 (poorest QOL). A severity score less 
than 60 suggests a small impact on disease-specific 
QOL, scores of 60 to 80 suggest a moderate 
impact, and scores above 80 suggest a large impact. 
3. The baseline survey score is calculated as the 
mean of the 18-item scores. The global QOL rating 
at the bottom of the survey form is read directly 
and is not used when calculating the baseline 
survey score. 
4. The same person who completed the baseline 
OSA-18 completes a second survey after a specific 
intervention (observation, medicine, or surgery), 
with a minimum time between surveys of 4 
weeks. The follow-up survey score is calculated as 
the mean of the 18-item scores. 
5. A change score is calculated by subtracting the 
follow-up survey score from the baseline survey 
score. A positive value indicates clinical improvement, 
and a negative value indicates deterioration. 
A change score of less than 0.5 indicates trivial 
change, 0.5 to 0.9 indicates small change, 1.0 to 
1.4 indicates moderate change, and 1.5 or greater 
indicates large change. 
QOL, Quality of life. 

trast, de Serres and colleagues5 validated a 6-item 
evaluative measure, the OSD-6. The OSD-6 uses a 
single question to assess a given domain, scoring 
a positive response if any of a list of related 
aspects of SDB presentation has occurred. Although 
a highly efficient use of parental time, this 
“any of” grouping may be more bias prone than a 

separate listing of SDB aspects within each domain 
(as occurs in the OSA-18).17 Second, unlike 
the OSA-18, the OSD-6 has not been validated 
against polysomnography. 

Change in health status can be measured directly 
by asking people how much better or worse 
they feel after an intervention or indirectly by 
assessing health status at two time points and 
studying the difference.13 Clinicians often use the 
direct approach, exemplified by questions such as 
“Since your child had surgery, how much has their 
quality of life changed?” Although this is a time-
honored approach, there are good reasons not to 
ask about change directly: people simply do not 
remember how they were at the beginning, and 
retrospective estimates of initial state are typically 
highly correlated with the present state (not the 
initial state). Because of these problems, indirect 
measurement of change is preferable.15-18 

Change scores are the preferred indirect measure 
of change in QOL for individuals.9,19 The 
change score is easily calculated by subtracting 
the follow-up survey score from the baseline score 
for the same patient (Table 6). A positive change 
score indicates a clinical improvement, and a negative 
score indicates a deterioration. The magnitude 
of the change score reflects the degree of 
change experienced by a given individual and has 
immediate clinical relevance. When using a 
7-point response scale, change scores of 0.5 generally 
indicate a small change, 1.0 indicates a 
moderate change, and 1.5 indicates a large 
change.12 These cutpoints appear similar for most 
7-point response scales, including the OSD-6 and 
the OSA-18 surveys. 

Another measure of responsiveness to change is 
the SRM, which is readily calculated as the mean 
change score divided by its standard deviation.18

SRMs obtained for the OSA-18 (Table 4) indicate 
large responsiveness to change for the overall survey 
score and for all domains except emotional 
distress. The OSD-6 has shown even larger responsiveness 
to change (SRM, 2.3)5 but for the 
sample herein demonstrated comparable responsiveness 
to the OSA-18 (SRM, 1.44 versus 1.61). 
The OSA-18, however, produced a more even 
distribution of change magnitude (Table 5) than 
the OSD-6 for our study population. The OSD-6 
yielded larger apparent benefits, with 42% of patients 
having large change versus only 22% for the 
OSA-18. Therefore, the OSA-18 yields more conservative 
change estimates. Further, the OSA-18 
change scores correlated with tonsil size (P . 
.001) and adenoid size (P . 
.009), whereas the 
OSD-6 change score correlated only with tonsil 
size (P . 
.014). 

Strengths of this study relate to the prospective 
design and use of sound psychometric principles 
for survey validation. The OSA-18 is also the only 
existing SDB survey previously validated as a 
discriminative measure using polysomnography. 
Further advantages of the OSA-18 include simplicity, 
self-administration, and a low response 
burden (completion in about 5 minutes). The survey 
does not contain age-specific questions, allowing 
a single instrument to be used for children 
aged 6 months through 12 years. While the OSD-6 
also uses age-independent questions, the survey 
was only validated for children aged 2 years. 

Weaknesses of this study relate primarily to the 
subject nature of QOL assessments and the difficulty 
in finding “gold standard” measures to assess 
criterion validity. To help reduce this problem, we 
compared the OSA-18 change score with multiple 
external constructs. Significant correlations were 
obtained with the OSD-6 change score (r . 
0.71, 
P . 
0.0001), direct change estimate (r . 
0.34, 
P . 
0.005), baseline tonsil size (r . 
0.40, P . 
0.001), and baseline adenoid size (r . 
0.31, P . 
0.009). OSA-18 change scores, however, did not 
correlate with the change in global quality of rating 
(r . 
0.21, P . 
0.082). Rather than suggest a 
problem with the OSA-18, we believe this further 
highlights the inability of a single global question 
to quantify change in disease-specific QOL. Despite 
the above concerns, the robust effect sizes 

SOHN and ROSENFELD 351 

(Table 4) obtained for the OSA-18 provide additional 
evidence of instrument responsiveness. 

The OSA-18 is suitable for use in a wide variety 
of situations for which patient-based outcomes are 
desirable. The survey is self-administered and easily 
completed by most caregivers in about 5 minutes. 
Clinicians could generate effectiveness data 
for marketing and quality improvement or for 
comparison with outcomes achieved by colleagues. 
Researchers could use the OSA-18 in 
conjunction with objective outcome measures (eg, 
polysomnography) to create expanded descriptions 
of patient-based outcomes for clinical trials 
and observational studies. We hope these efforts 
will contribute to improved QOL and enlightened 
clinical management of children with SDB.
