Objective: 
To evaluate the effect of snoring and obstructive 
respiratory events on the distribution of sleep 
stages and arousals in a nonselected group of adolescents 
from the general population. 

Design: 
Cross-sectional study. 

Setting: 
Randomly selected secondary schools in Seville, 
Spain. 

Patients: 
A general population sample of 43 adolescents 
(mean [SD] age, 13.6 [1.77] years). 

Interventions: 
A questionnaire for the investigation of 
sleep-related breathing disorders was administered. Symptoms 
were evaluated according to a 4-point frequency 
scale. Snorers answered “sometimes” or “often” to the 
question about snoring, and nonsnorers answered “never” 
or “rarely.” All subjects underwent standard polysomnography 
at the sleep laboratory. 

Results: 
Twenty-eight subjects were snorers; 15 were non-
snorers. No statistically significant differences were noted 
between both groups in the percentages of sleep stages, 
arousal index, awakenings, or wakefulness during sleep. 
Snorers showed a significantly higher number of respiratory 
arousals than nonsnorers (mean [SD], 1.14 [1.5] vs 

0.33 [0.6], P.05). However, neither the apneahypopnea 
index (AHI) nor the oxygen desaturation index 
correlated with the arousal index. Twelve snorers 
(27.5%) had an AHI of 2 or more; 13 nonsnorers (30.2%) 
had an AHI of less than 2. Snorers with some obstructive 
respiratory events had a significantly higher number of 
awakenings, a lower percentage of stage 4 sleep, and a 
higher number of respiratory events compared with non-
snorers. However, the total number of arousals and the 
arousal index were similar for both groups. Wakefulness 
during sleep tended to be longer in snorers than in non-
snorers although differences were not significant. The percentage 
of respiratory events that terminated with an arousal 
was greater in snorers who had an AHI of 2 or more than 
in nonsnorers who had an AHI of less than 2 (mean [SD], 
8.4% [9.5%] vs 4.9% [11.53%], P.05). 
Conclusions: 
These data indicate normal sleep architecture 
in the adolescents. Although snorers as well as 
adolescents with some polysomnographic abnormality 
showed a higher number of respiratory arousals than control 
subjects, most obstructive events did not terminate 
with a cortical arousal, which may suggest that adolescents 
share with younger children this mechanism for 
preserving sleep architecture.

DULTS WITH sleep-related 
breathing disorders 
(SRBDs) have arousals 
from sleep causing sleep 
fragmentation. The term 
arousal 
refers to a rapid desynchronization 
of cerebral bioelectrical activity with 
or without an associated increase in 
muscular and vegetative activity. The 
number and characteristics of arousals 
are influenced by some factors, such as 
the subject’s age and the different sleep 
stages at which arousals occur. Arousals 
constitute an indicator of sleep quality 
and, therefore, of sleep fragmentation, 
both in normal and pathologic conditions.
1 

Polysomnographic features of SRBDs 
in adults are well established. A decrease 
in the percentages of various sleep stages 
and rapid eye movement (REM) secondary 
to sleep fragmentation caused by arousals 
that occur in response to obstructive 
respiratory events have been shown to frequently 
occur. On the other hand, cognitive 
impairment and excessive daytime 
sleepiness have been related to the frequency 
of arousals.2,3 Clinical and polysomnographic 
characteristics of children 
with SRBDs differ notably from those 
found in adults, with a lower number of 
respiratory events and a persistent and partial 
obstructive pattern of the upper airway 
accompanied by hypercapnia. In ad

dition, cortical arousals at the end of the obstructive event 
are infrequent in the pediatric population and, therefore, 
sleep architecture is usually preserved.4 

There is little information regarding SRBDs in adolescents. 
Normative data on polysomnographic factors 
in the adolescent age group have been recently reported. 
These data, however, have been collected from 
series that used a mixed population sample of children 
and adolescents5 and in which there were restrictive selection 
criteria,6 or in which only cardiorespiratory factors 
of polysomnography were investigated.7 

Because, to our knowledge; no systematic studies 
assessing the influence of some variables related to SRBDs 
on sleep architecture in the adolescent age group have 
been performed, the objective of this study was to evaluate 
the effect of snoring and obstructive respiratory events 
on the distribution of sleep stages and arousals in a non-
selected group of adolescents from the general population. 


METHODS
STUDY 
DESIGN 


This study is the second phase of a cross-sectional study carried 
out by our group in a population of 246 adolescents of 
both sexes ranging in age from 11 through 19 years, the 
results of which have recently been reported.7 In the first 
phase of this study we investigated a general population 
sample of 101 adolescents (mean [SD] age, 13.2 [0.8] years) 
to determine the frequency, symptoms, and polygraphic features 
of SRBD. A total of 12 schools were randomly selected 
using the official directory of public and private secondary 
schools in Seville, Spain. No inclusion or exclusion criteria 
based on the absence or presence of previous or underlying 
diseases were established. The study was approved by the 
institutional review board (Research Ethics board of Virgen 
del Roci´o University Hospital) and the local educational 
authorities. Written informed consent was obtained from adolescents 
who voluntarily agreed to take part and from their 
parents or legal guardians. In this nonselected group of 
healthy adolescents, symptoms potentially associated with 
SRBDs showed a similar frequency to that reported for 
younger children. Snoring was associated with a higher occurrence 
of other nocturnal symptoms, a more central pattern of 
body fat distribution, and a higher respiratory disturbance 
index compared with nonsnorers. Although polygraphic 
abnormalities were mild, 2 cases of probable SRBDs were 
found (prevalence rate, 1.9%). 

The study included the administration of a questionnaire 
for the investigation of SRBD symptoms. The questionnaire 
has been described in detail elsewhere.7 Nocturnal and daytime 
symptoms suggestive of SRBDs were assessed according 
to a 4-point frequency scale, from “never” to “rarely” (once a 
week or less), “sometimes” (twice a week), or “often” (thrice 
a week or more). For this study, snoring was the only nocturnal 
symptom suggestive of SRBDs analyzed. Snorers answered 
sometimes or often on the question about snoring, and nonsnorers 
answered never or rarely. In the second phase of the 
study, random samples of 40 of 75 snorers and 20 of 171 non-
snorers were invited for an overnight stay in the sleep laboratory 
for polysomnography. A final sample of 28 snorers (70%) 
and 15 nonsnorers (75%) (control group) agreed to participate 
and underwent full polysomnography. 

POLYSOMNOGRAPHY 


The polysomnography consisted of continuous polygraphic recordings 
for a whole night from 10 PM to 7 AM using standardized 
equipment (Somnostar 4100; SensorMedics Corporation, 
Yorba Linda, Calif) from surface leads for electroencephalography 
(C3/A2, C4/A1, O1/A2, and O2/A1 placements), electrooculography, 
tibial and submental electromyograms, and electrocardiogram. 
For respiratory sensors we used nasal and oral 
signals by thermistors; chest and abdominal effort was measured 
by 2 belt sensors (piezo-electric gauge; Healthdyne Technologies 
Inc, Marietta, Ga). Arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) 
was recorded by digital pulse oximetry and body position was 
monitored by the polysomnographic system. Analysis of recordings 
obtained by polysomnography was performed by an 
experienced neurophysiologist (G.B.) who was unaware if polysomnograms 
belonged to a subject in the snoring group or to 
a control subject. 

Sleep studies were performed according to standards for 
cardiopulmonary sleep studies in children.8 A complete cessation 
of oronasal flow (thermistor signal) with continued 
respiratory efforts of 5 seconds or more was defined as 
apnea. Hypopnea was defined as a discernible reduction of 
50% or higher in oronasal flow and reduction in oxygen 
saturation by at least 4% from baseline. Each 30-second 
epoch of the recording was scored for sleep stage, breathing, 
oxygenation, and movement. Sleep data were staged according 
to the system of Rechtschaffen and Kales.9 An arousal 
was defined according to the American Sleep Disorders 
Association10 as a sudden burst of alpha electroencephalographic 
frequency lasting more than 3 seconds accompanied 
by concurrent electromyographic activity in REM sleep 
(Figure). Each arousal was examined to decide whether it 
was associated with a respiratory event. This was determined 
by checking for the presence of apnea or hypopnea preceding 
each arousal. Awakenings were defined as arousals lasting 
for 30 seconds or longer.11 

The following variables were analyzed: total recording time, 
total sleep time, sleep efficiency (total sleep time per total recording 
time), sleep architecture (percentages of sleep stages), 
number of awakenings, total number of arousals, arousal index 
(number of arousals per hour of total sleep time), number 
of respiratory arousals, wakefulness during sleep, apneahypopnea 
index (AHI) (total number of scored apneas and hypopneas 
divided by the number of hours of sleep), SaO2 baseline 
and SaO2 nadir (lowest value during total sleep time), 
percentage of total recording time with the SaO2 level exceeding 
90%, and oxygen desaturation index (number of oxygen 
desaturations per hour). 

STATISTICAL 
ANALYSIS 


Statistical analyses and the calculations were performed using 
SPSS for Windows, Version 9.0 (SPSS, Chicago, Ill). All results 
are expressed as mean (SD). The nonparametric Mann-
Whitney test was used for the comparison of quantitative variables 
between the groups of snorers vs nonsnorers (controls) 
as well as between snorers with an AHI of 2 or more vs non-
snorers with an AHI of less than 2. The strength of the association 
between variables was assessed by the Pearson correlation 
coefficient. Statistical significance was set at P.05. 

RESULTS
The study population consisted of 43 adolescents, 24 
boys and 19 girls who had a mean (SD) age of 13.6 
(1.77) years (age range, 11-19 years). There were no

variables except for total sleep time, 
which was significantly shorter in girls (343.37 [36.57] 
minutes) than in boys (375 [71.35] minutes) (P.03) 
(Table 
1). 

Results of polysomnography in snorers (n=28) and 
nonsnorers (n=15) are given in Table 
2. There were 
no statistically significant differences between both groups 
in the percentages of sleep stages, arousal index, awakenings, 
or wakefulness during sleep. Snorers showed a 
significantly higher number of respiratory arousals than 
nonsnorers (1.14 [1.5] vs 0.33 [0.6], P.047). However, 
neither the AHI nor the oxygen desaturation index 
correlated with the arousal index. 

Of the total number of 43 adolescents included in 
the study, there were 12 snorers (27.5%) who had an 
AHI of 2 or more and 13 nonsnorers (30.2%) with an 
AHI of less than 2. Snorers with some obstructive respiratory 
events had a significantly higher number of 
awakenings, a lower percentage of stage 4 sleep, and a 
higher number of respiratory arousals compared with 
nonsnorers with an AHI of less than 2 (Table 
3). 
However, the total number of arousals and the arousal 
index was similar in both groups. Wakefulness during 
sleep tended to be longer in snorers who had an AHI of 
2 or more than in nonsnorers who had an AHI of less 

than 2, although differences were not statistically significant. 
The percentage of respiratory events that terminated 
with an arousal was greater in snorers who had 
an AHI of 2 or more than in nonsnorers who had an 
AHI of less than 2 (8.4% [9.5%] vs 4.9% [11.53%], 
P.05). 

COMMENT
In this study we have evaluated the influence of snoring 
and respiratory events on the distribution of sleep stages 
and sleep architecture in a nonselected group of adolescents 
from the general population. In contrast to adults, 
snorers in the adolescent age group including those with 
some respiratory events in the polysomnography did not 
show relevant changes in sleep architecture; however, 
snorers with polysomnographic abnormalities showed a 
higher number of arousals associated with respiratory 
events and a decrease in the percentage of stage 4 sleep 
compared with nonsnorers. 

For the definition of respiratory events, we used a 
minimal duration of 5 seconds instead of 10 seconds accepted 
for adults because in previous studies carried out 
by our group in children, it was found that this short obstructive 
event may cause falls in SaO2 levels,12,13 and, thus, 
are clinically important. The clinical significance of short

apneas also has been emphasized by others.5 We choose 
to perform the polysomnographic recording using a 
thermistor for oronasal flow. Although this technique is 
known to have limitations in detecting obstructive 
events,14,15 it is relatively noninvasive and, thus, does not 
disturb sleep. Esophageal probes may measure respiratory 
effort more accurately, but they significantly interfere 
with sleep efficiency in the pediatric population.4

We used an AHI of 2 of more as the cutoff point because 
the mean value in our series was 1.8 (1.3) (range, 
0-5.8). Most AHI values were within the range of normal 
data according to a study carried out by Acebo et al6 
in which the mean value of the AHI in a healthy adolescent 
and young adult population was 1.3 (1.3). Our values 
are slightly higher probably because no inclusion or 
exclusion criteria were applied in the present study. However, 
since normative data regarding polysomnographic 
characteristics in the adolescent age group have not been 
standardized, decisions for establishing cutoff points are 
arbitrary. 

In the pediatric population, different criteria for the 
definition of arousals are used and interpretations regarding 
normal values and their precise clinical significance 
are controversial.16 The 2 classifications more widely 
used are that of Rechtschaffen and Kales9 and that proposed 
by the American Sleep Disorders Association,10 
which was the definition used in this study. 

Normal electroencephalographic characteristics in 
adolescence are not well known, although a few studies 
have been carried out. Kahn et al17 reviewed the literature 
and collected data on normal sleep architecture 
along different developmental stages, from neonates to 
adolescents, and found that electroencephalographic 
features of adolescents were similar to those of young 
adults. Slow wave sleep decreases progressively according 
to puberal Tanner stages (about 35% decrease from 
stage 1 to stage 5 sleep). On the other hand, the distribution 
of REM and non-REM sleep has shown similar 
values than what is seen in adults, and REM sleep periods 
are more prolonged during the second half of the 
night.18 In our series, the percentages of each sleep stage

were similar to those reported by other authors in studies 
of adolescents,6 although the proportion of REM 
sleep in our study was slightly lower (15% of the total 
sleep time) compared with results of the study of Acebo 
et al6 (17.7% of total sleep time). The arousal index was 
also similar to that reported by others.6 

The mean time of sleep, in our study, was longer 
than 6 hours, with a mean sleep efficiency of 89%. Boys 
showed a mean duration of total sleep time slightly higher 
than girls (375 minutes vs 343 minutes, P=.03), without 
differences in sleep efficiency. Gau and Soong19 in a 
large sample of adolescents found a lower number of sleep 
hours among girls, although no differences were found 
between both sexes in excessive daytime sleepiness. In 
our series, no differences in the distribution of sleep stages 
or in the number of arousals between boys and girls were 
noted. 

The relationship between SRBDs and sleep architecture 
in adults is well known. Adults with SRBDs usually 
present multiple arousals secondary to repetitive increases 
in respiratory effort during obstructive respiratory 
events causing sleep fragmentation and a reduction of the 
percentages of non-REM stages 3 and 4 and REM sleep.20,21 
Polysomnographic changes in children with SRBDs are 
different than those found in adults.22 With regard to neurophysiologic 
factors in children, obstructive respiratory 
events do not frequently terminate with a cortical 
arousal and, consequently, sleep architecture is usually 
preserved.23 In this respect, Goh et al4 carried out a retrospective 
study of 20 children diagnosed as having obstructive 
sleep apnea syndrome by standard polysomnography 
compared with healthy controls. There were 
no differences in the distribution of sleep stages or in the 
degree of sleep fragmentation between patients with obstructive 
sleep apnea syndrome and controls. These results 
are in accord with other studies in which it has been 
shown that there are no changes in sleep architecture after 
adenotonsillectomy in children with obstructive sleep 
apnea syndrome.24,25 However, in other studies of children 
with polysomnographic confirmation of obstructive 
sleep apnea syndrome, a higher number of spontaneous 
and movement arousals has been reported than seen 
in controls.26 

In adolescents, the influence of snoring and respiratory 
events on sleep architecture is unknown. In this 
series, we have not found important alterations of sleep 
architecture; the findings from all study subjects indicated 
that sleep macroarchitecture and microarchitecture 
were within normal limits. Most obstructive respiratory 
events did not terminate in a respiratory arousal, 
which suggests that neurophysiologic response to these 
events in adolescents from the general population is 
similar to that already known for younger children.4 
Snorers and nonsnorers from the adolescent age group 
had similar polysomnographic characteristics, except 
for a higher number of respiratory arousals among 
snorers. These findings suggest that in snorers from the 
adolescent age group, there may be some episodes of 
increased resistance of the upper airway that are not 
detected by the thermistor signal. Snorers with an AHI 
of 2 also had a higher number of respiratory arousals 
than controls. Moreover, there were more episodes of 

WhatThisStudyAdds
It is known that clinical and polysomnographic characteristics 
of children with SRBDs differ from those found 
in adults. In adolescents, no systematic studies assessing 
the influence of snoring and respiratory events on 
sleep architecture have been performed. Data from this 
study indicate that adolescents from the general population 
show a normal sleep architecture and that neurophysiologic 
response to respiratory events is similar to 
that already known for younger children. 

awakenings and a slightly lower percentage of non-
REM stage 4 sleep. This finding would be consistent 
with what is known for younger children with SRBDs, 
in which REM sleep tends to be preserved.27 

Data from this study indicate that adolescents from 
the general population show a normal sleep architecture. 
Although snorers and adolescents with some polysomnographic 
abnormalities showed a higher number of 
respiratory arousals than controls, most obstructive events 
did not terminate with a cortical arousal, which may suggest 
that adolescents share with younger children this 
mechanism for preserving sleep architecture. However, 
it cannot be discarded that children and adolescents with 
SRBDs may present subtle electroencephalographic 
changes that cannot be detected by the standard techniques 
and conventional criteria used for adults.14,28 It 
may also be possible that subcortical or autonomic arousals 
may play an important role as a response to apneic 
activity in the adolescent population.29 

Finally, adolescents in this study were selected from 
the general population and showed slight polysomnographic 
changes, so that it cannot be excluded that patients 
with severe SRBDs in this age group might experience 
sleep architecture alterations similar to those 
reported in adults with SRBDs.
