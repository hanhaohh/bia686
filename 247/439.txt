V.A. Miller, MA; T.M. Palermo, PhD; S.W. Powers, PhD; M.S. Scher, MD; A.D. Hershey, MD, PhD 
Objective.—The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of sleep disturbances in children 
with migraine headaches and to describe individual differences in sleep behaviors based on headache features (eg, 
frequency, duration, intensity). 

Background.—A relationship between migraine headaches and sleep disturbances has been suggested in both 
children and adults, but there is a lack of research examining the relationship between specific headache features 
and the range of sleep behaviors in children. 

Methods.—One hundred eighteen children, aged 2 to 12 years (mean, 9.1; standard deviation, 2.3) were evaluated 
for headaches at two pediatric neurology departments. Parents completed the Children’s Sleep Habits 
Questionnaire and a standardized questionnaire regarding headache characteristics. 

Results.—Parents reported a high rate of sleep disturbances in children, including sleeping too little (42%), 
bruxism (29%), child co-sleeping with parents (25%), and snoring (23%). Children with migraine headaches experienced 
more sleep disturbances compared to published healthy control norms. After controlling for child demographics, 
we found that the frequency and duration of migraine headaches predicted specific sleep disturbances, 
including sleep anxiety, parasomnias, and bedtime resistance. 

Conclusions.—Children with migraine headaches have a high prevalence of sleep disturbances. The direction 
of the relationship between headaches and sleep is unknown. Regardless, interventions targeting sleep habits may 
improve headache symptoms, and effective treatment of headaches in children may positively impact sleep.

Primary headaches occur frequently in childhood. 
In large population-based studies, approximately 10% 
of children meet International Headache Society 
(IHS) criteria for migraine headache.1,2 Tension-type 
and nonspecific recurrent headaches have been reported 
in another 2% to 3% of children.1 

Inadequate sleep duration or poor sleep quality 
are common triggering factors for migraine headaches.

co-occurrence of sleep disturbances and headaches in 
children.4,5 In fact, sleep disturbances and migraine 
are part of a cluster of recurrent clinical symptoms 
that make up what has been called the periodic syndrome 
of childhood.5 It has been proposed that sleep 
and migraines may be aspects of a common genetic, 
pathophysiological, or biobehavioral substrate, accounting 
for the comorbidity of these problems in 
children. 

However, while a relationship between migraine 
headaches and sleep disturbances has been found in 
adults, research with pediatric populations remains 
limited.6 One case-control study demonstrated that 
children with headaches had a higher prevalence of a 
variety of sleep problems compared to healthy controls, 
including insufficient sleep, co-sleeping, difficulty 
getting to sleep at night, anxieties about going to 
sleep, restless sleep, nighttime wakings, nightmares, 
and daytime sleepiness.7 Previous findings in children

also suggest that the type of headache diagnosis may 
be related to specific sleep behaviors, with migraine 
headache shown to relate to breathing difficulties, 
sleep talking, bruxism, somnambulism (sleepwalking), 
and enuresis.7,8 

Apart from the potential direct effects in triggering 
migraine headaches, recent research has suggested 
that disruptions in sleep can have far-reaching 
consequences on the quality of children’s lives and, 
thus, are important to treat. For example, disruptions 
in sleep can impact school attendance and performance, 
daily activities, and emotional status.9,10 

Despite their potential importance, there is a 
lack of research on how specific migraine headache 
characteristics (eg, frequency, duration, pain intensity) 
relate to sleep behaviors. For example, children 
with more frequent, longer, or more severe headaches 
may have more sleep difficulties. Previous 
studies have assessed sleep disturbances in a variety 
of ways, making it difficult to compare results across 
studies. The aim of the present study was to contribute 
further descriptive data on the prevalence of 
sleep disturbances in children with migraines using a 
validated sleep screening instrument and to describe 
individual differences in sleep behaviors based on 
headache and pain features. 

METHODS 

Participants.—One hundred eighteen children, 
aged 2 to 12 years (mean, 9.1; standard deviation, 2.3) 
were seen for new patient appointments at an outpatient 
pediatric neurology clinic (Cleveland site) and 
an outpatient Pediatric Headache Center (Cincinnati 
site) from September 1999 to June 2000. For the total 
sample, diagnoses using IHS criteria included migraine 
(96%) and migraine with aura (4%). Only patients 
diagnosed with migraine headache by IHS criteria 
were included in this report. 

Procedure and Measures.—Sleep Disturbances.— 
The Children’s Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) is 
a parent-report measure designed to examine the sleep 
behaviors of school-aged children over a typical week.11 
The 45-item Likert-type questionnaire yields a total 
score (“total sleep disturbance”) and 8 conceptually 
grouped subscales based on the primary presenting 
clinical sleep problems in this age group: bedtime resis


tance, sleep onset delay, sleep duration, sleep anxiety, 
parasomnias, sleep-disordered breathing, daytime 
sleepiness, and night wakings. Parents rate the frequency 
of sleep behaviors on a 3-point scale: “usually” 
(5 to 7 times per week), “sometimes” (2 to 4 times per 
week), or “rarely” (0 to 1 time per week). For example, 
one item on the bedtime resistance subscale is “child 
struggles at bedtime (cries, refuses to stay in bed, etc).” 
Higher scores indicate greater sleep disturbance. Previous 
studies demonstrated adequate internal consistency 
for the total sleep disturbance scale in both a 
community sample (.68) and a sample of children 
with sleep disorders (.78). The internal consistency 
of the subscales ranged from .36 to .70 for the community 
sample and from .56 to .93 for the clinic sample.11 
The low values for some of the subscales may be due to 
the multidimensional nature of the items that comprise 
the subscales. Test-retest reliability was acceptable, and 
good validity was established.11 

Headache Characteristics.—Headache frequency, 
duration, pain severity, and history of onset were examined 
with the Headache Intake Questionnaire.12 The 
neurologist treating each patient verified information, 
and IHS criteria were used for the diagnosis. The 
questionnaires were completed by parents and patients 
as part of their initial headache evaluation and 
management. 

Statistical Analyses.—Data were analyzed using 
the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 

9.0. Chi-square and t tests were used to compare the 
samples from the 2 sites on demographic variables and 
headache characteristics. One-sample t tests were used 
to compare the sleep behaviors of children with migraine 
headaches to published norms. The relationships 
among migraine characteristics and sleep behaviors 
were examined using Pearson product moment 
correlation coefficients. Hierarchical multiple regression 
analyses were used to examine relationships between 
headache characteristics and sleep disturbances 
after controlling for child demographics. P values of 
.05 were considered to be statistically significant.

teristics (frequency, duration, length of time since 
headache onset, and pain intensity) in participants 
from the 2 sites were equivalent. Therefore, all analyses 
include the combined sample. 

Sleep Behaviors Compared to Published Norms.— 
Children’s Sleep Habits Questionnaire subscale 
scores for children with migraine headaches were 
compared to published healthy control norms using 
one-sample t tests. The normative community sample 
consisted of 469 students, aged 4 to 10 years, from a 
predominantly white middle-income suburban school 
system.9 Children with migraine were found to have 
more sleep disturbances related to sleep onset delay, 
bedtime resistance, duration of sleep, daytime sleepiness, 
night wakings, sleep anxiety, parasomnias, and 
sleep-disordered breathing compared to the control 
norms (see Figure). 

Prevalence of Specific Sleep Behaviors in Children 
With Migraine Headaches.—The prevalence of 

specific sleep behaviors was examined. Parents 
of children with migraine reported a high rate of child 
sleeping too little (42%), bruxism (29%), child cosleeping 
with parents (25%), and snoring (23%). 

Relationship Between Demographics and Sleep 
Behaviors.—Pearson product moment correlation 
coefficients were used to describe associations between 
demographic variables (age, sex, and minority 
status) and sleep behaviors. Younger age was associated 
with longer duration of sleep (r .37, P.0001), 
and higher rates of bedtime resistance (r .37, 
P.0001), night wakings (r .34, P.0001), sleep 
anxiety (r .28, P.002), parasomnias (r .25, 
P.002), restless sleep (r .20, P.03), and bruxism 
(r .21, P.02). Female gender was associated 
with more daytime sleepiness (r .23, P.01), while 
male gender was associated with more frequent enuresis 
(r .19, P.04). Minority status was associated 
with more daytime sleepiness (r .20, P.03)

and a higher frequency of co-sleeping (r .18, 
P.05). 

Relationship Between Migraine Headache Characteristics 
and Sleep Behaviors.—The relationships 
of the frequency, severity, duration, and length of 
time with migraines to sleep behaviors were examined 
with Pearson product moment correlation coefficients. 
No significant correlations were found between 
migraine characteristics and the subscales of 
the CSHQ. Based on previous research demonstrating 
relationships between headaches and specific 
sleep behaviors, specific items from the CSHQ were 
also examined (nightmares, restless sleep, co-sleeping, 
bruxism, sleep talking, sleepwalking, enuresis, and 
parent report of total sleep duration) and are reported 
in Table 2. The frequency of migraines was 
positively related to the frequency of somnambulism 
(r .21, P.05) and bruxism (r .26, P.01). The 
pain intensity of migraines was negatively related to 
parent report of sleep duration with children with 
more intense migraines demonstrating shorter sleep 
duration (r .21, P.05). Specific migraine characteristics 
were not related to nightmares, restless 
sleep, sleep talking, or enuresis. 

Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were 
computed to identify predictors of children’s sleep 
disturbances. Child age, sex, and minority status were 
entered first. Headache characteristics (frequency, 
severity, duration, and length of time with migraine 
headaches) were entered last to examine the effect of 
these characteristics after controlling for the separate

COMMENTS 

Children with migraine headaches appear to 
have a range of sleep disturbances. Insufficient sleep, 
bruxism, and co-sleeping are common. Consistent 
with prior research, children with migraine experienced 
significantly more frequent sleep disturbances 
compared to children from a normative community 
sample.7 Children with migraine experienced greater 
sleep disturbances in all domains including longer 
sleep onset delay, more bedtime resistance, shorter 
sleep duration, more daytime sleepiness, more night 
wakings, greater sleep anxiety, more parasomnias, 
and more sleep-disordered breathing. 

The present study extended previous findings by 
examining the relationships between specific migraine 
headache characteristics (frequency, intensity, 
duration, and onset of headaches) and sleep disturbances. 
Frequency, duration, and intensity of pain associated 
with migraine were found to significantly relate 
to the occurrence of specific sleep-related behaviors, 
including shortened sleep duration, somnambulism, 
bruxism, sleep anxiety, and bedtime resistance. The 
frequency and duration of headaches were associated 
with sleep disturbances even after controlling for demographic 
variables. However, it is unclear if frequent, 
long-lasting, and intense migraine led to specific 
sleep disturbances, whether sleep disturbances 
increased the occurrence of migraine, or whether 
sleep disturbances and migraine are part of a separate 
clinical syndrome. Several hypotheses have been 
put forth to explain the relationship between sleep 
and headaches, but the nature of the sleep-headache 
relationship remains unknown and warrants further 
investigation.13

headache assessment. For example, questions about 
sleep duration, pattern, and behaviors may provide 
additional information about the course of children’s 
headaches. Such questions are especially important 
because children may not independently raise concerns 
about sleep-related problems.7 Furthermore, 
parents may underestimate or miss such problems or 
may not mention their concerns during a headache 
evaluation.7 Therefore, sleep-related problems may 
remain undetected in the absence of screening for 
such difficulties. 

It is unknown how children presenting with cooccurring 
sleep problems and migraine headaches respond 
to standard headache treatment (eg, migraine 
prophylactic medication). Interventions with children 
with migraine and sleep problems remain an important 
area for future investigation. Increasing total 
sleep time may impact the occurrence of children’s 
headaches. Bruni and colleagues evaluated the effects 
of sleep hygiene education (eg, conformity of 
bedtime and waking time, regularity of sleep schedule 
on weekdays and weekends, and restriction of 
beverages and foods that disrupt sleep) on headache 
symptoms in a sample of children with migraine.14 
Their findings demonstrated a reduction in the frequency 
and duration of migraine in the group of children 
who received sleep hygiene education compared 
to those who received no education. 

One limitation of the present study was its correlational 
design. Future research is needed to determine 
the direction of the relationship between 
migraine headaches and sleep disturbances. Longitudinal 
studies examining changes in migraine and 
sleep behaviors over time may shed light on this issue. 
In addition, assessment of dietary habits is important 
for future research, due to the influence of 
specific foods and beverages (eg, caffeine) on sleep. 
Furthermore, in future studies the use of daily diaries 
may allow for more accurate reporting of both 
sleep and headache characteristics. For example, in 
a recent study of adults with headache, Penzien and 
colleagues examined relationships of daily stress, 
sleep, and headache using prospective diary data to 
support anecdotal observations regarding temporal 
patterning of stress-headache and sleep-headache 
associations.15 Such research could be extended to 

the pediatric population to identify associations between 
migraine and sleep.
