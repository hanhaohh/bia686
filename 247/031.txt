ance. For a threshold of AHI of 20, AS showed 73.0% accuracy, 97. 
sensitivity and 60% specificity, with positive and negative predictiv. 
values of 78% and 93%, respectively. Sensitivity, specificity an. 
negative predictive values increased in parallel to the increase in AH. 
threshold for detecting OSA. However, when the differences o.

ever, due to the relatively small number o. 
sleep disorders laboratories and to the exces. 
sive cost of PSG, alternative, less expensiv. 
and simplified but reliable techniques ar. 
needed for the diagnosis of the population o. 
patients with suspected OSA. The AutoSet. 
(AS) (ResCare Ltd., Sydney, Australia) i. 
the recently introduced diagnostic mode (6. 
8) allows an immediate analysis of flow/tim. 
curves which permits the detection of ap. 
neas, hypopneas and upper airway resis. 
tance (9). This method is quite accessibl. 
and requires only the application of prong. 
to the nostrils and the use of a pulse oxymete. 
on one finger. 


Our aim was to compare the accuracy o. 
AS for the diagnosis of OSA with that of . 
computerized PSG system in 56 subject. 
with clinical characteristics of OSA. 


Material and Methods 

Sixty-three patients were evaluated an. 
seven were excluded due to technical prob. 
lems: 5 patients with dislodgment of th. 
nasal prongs from the nostrils at a specifi. 
time during the night and 2 patients due t. 
recording problems with the AS. Thus, 5. 
patients (45 men and 11 women) with sus. 
pected clinical OSA but without other asso. 
ciated diseases were investigated in a pro. 
spective study. The mean age (± SD) of th. 
patients was 44.6 ± 12 years (range: 13 to 6. 
years) and mean body mass index was 31.3 . 
7 kg/m2 (range: 19 to 56 kg/m2). 


All patients were submitted to full-nigh. 
PSG using an Oxford Medilog SACTM Slee. 
Analyzing Computer system (Oxford Instru. 
ments plc, Oxford, UK) and the followin. 
parameters were recorded: electroencepha. 
logram (EEG), electro-oculograms, submen. 
tal electromyogram, electrocardiogram, digi. 
tal pulse oxymetry, oral and nasal airflow. 
chest and abdominal movement, and bod. 
position. All PSG respiratory events (wit. 
the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) considere. 
for total time recorded) and sleep stagin. 


data were manually scored according to th. 
criteria of Rechtschaffen and Kales (10) b. 
an experienced staff member. The criteri. 
adopted to define respiratory events were a. 
apneas characterized by absence of, or dro. 
in, airflow higher than 80% in relation t. 
basal values, associated or not with alter. 
ations in chest and abdominal movement. 
for more than 10 s; b) hypopneas, character. 
ized by a drop in airflow between 50 an. 
80% of basal values, for more than 10 s. 
associated with an oxygen destruction o. 
³4% or arousal, and c) AHI, characterize. 
by the sum of apnea and hypopnea events. 
total recording time (TRT). Traditionally. 
the AHI is calculated as the ratio of apnea. 
and hypopneas/total sleep time; however. 
the AS just reports the AHI during TRT. 
since it does not record the EEG. So, t. 
compare this parameter in both systems (PS. 
and AS) we just considered the AHI relate. 
to TRT. Twelve patients presented with a. 
AHI <10 and 20 with an AHI >40. Concur. 
rently with classic PSG recordings, patient. 
were also connected to the AS in the diag. 
nostic mode, with a nasal prong carefull. 
placed on the nostrils in parallel to a therma. 
airflow from the Oxford System accordin. 
to the method of Norman et al. (11). Anothe. 
digital pulse oxymeter for the AS was in. 
stalled on a different finger of the same han. 
where the first oxymeter had been positioned. 


The AS has two functional modes: diag. 
nostic and treatment. In the diagnostic mode. 
the AS pressure transducer evaluates th. 
flow generated in the nostrils through stan. 
dard nasal cannulae. The internal pressur. 
transducer and the system software allow th. 
estimation of airflow and of the flow/tim. 
relationship (12). Snoring is qualitativel.

band-pass filtering. Using a Biox 3700e ex.

and recordings were started simultaneousl.

Statistical analysis 

The AHI values obtained by PSG and A. 
were analyzed as follows: AHI values wer. 
first analyzed descriptively to determine thei. 
normality using the Skewness and Kurtosi. 
tests. The paired Student t-test was the. 
applied to compare the AHI results obtaine. 
by the two methods. The intraclass correla. 
tion coefficient (ICC) and its variance wer. 
then calculated to determine the agreemen. 
between methods. Agreement between AH. 
obtained by PSG and by AS was also evalu. 
ated using the Bland and Altman plots (13. 
simply to show the trends and variability fo. 
the two methods. Sensitivity, specificity, an. 
the positive (PPV) and negative predictiv. 
values (NPV) of data related to AS wer. 


obtained independently for AHI threshold. 
of 10, 20 and 40. Finally, regression analysi. 


dency of AS to overscore AHI, which van. 
ished when values of AHIPSG were highe. 
than 60 (Figure 2). After these threshold. 
(AHIPSG = 60), the mean values of AHIPS. 
and AHIAS were 72.9 and 75.9, respectivel. 
(P = 0.48) and the mean AHIPSG-AHIAS dif. 
ference was 3.01 ± 9.5. The accuracy, sensi. 
tivity, specificity and PPV and NPV of A. 
for threshold values of 10, 20 and 40 ar. 
presented in Table 1. Finally, regression a. 
nalysis of AHIPSG values in relation to thos. 
obtained by AHIAS showed that the bes. 
function was a 3rd degree polynomial (cubi. 
regression) (Y = 5.73482 - 0.19885 X . 
0.0278 X2 - 0.000168 X3) with R = 0.92.

Discussion 

Population awareness of OSA, especiall. 
in developing countries, is unlikely. Thi. 
problem is further compounded by the fac. 
that in Brazil epidemiological data on snor. 
ing and daytime sleepiness are limited (14). 
Costs of performing traditional PSG record. 
ings are high and public and most privat. 
health insurance policies do not cover diag. 
nostic and therapeutic procedures. This, de. 
spite the cardiovascular risks (2,3) and th. 
impaired daytime cognitive function, a rec. 
ognized co-factor in the etiology of occupa. 
tional and road traffic accidents (15). Th. 
development of simpler and less expensiv. 
diagnostic methods, particularly for typica. 
cases, is urgently needed. History, physica. 
examination, observation during sleep an. 
pulse oxymetry yield limited diagnostic dat. 
(16,17). AS is a simple, low-cost metho. 
which does not demand complex technica. 
expertise, allowing even home monitoring. 
One limitation of AS for diagnosing OSA i. 
in relation to patients with nasal diseases. 
particularly those with mouth respiration a. 
night. The high ICC with low variance show. 
the high concordance between AHIPSG an. 
AHIAS. However, despite these results, th. 
Student. 
t-test showed significantly lowe. 
AHIPSG values than AHIAS values and a poo. 


agreement between methods when AHIPS. 
and ASAS where analyzed according to th. 
Bland and Altman plot (13) (Figure 2). Th. 
tendency of AS to overvalue AHI was re. 
ported by us and by others (6-8), however. 
these investigators assumed a linear rela. 
tionship between AHI obtained by two sys. 
tems. As observed in Figure 1, we describe. 
an original data 3rd degree polynomial (cu. 
bic regression) that best related AHI an. 


The distribution of the differences o. 
AHIPSG-AS vs their means (Figure 2) showe. 
a tendency of AHIAS to overvalue AHIPSG u. 
to an AHI value of 60. However, this ten. 
dency disappeared with AHI >60, when ou. 
patients presented with a typical picture o. 
the syndrome. Also, as seen in Figure 1, w. 
can reliably predict the AHI by using the A. 
if a more sophisticated analysis is performed. 
The sensitivity and specificity of AS (97. 
and 40% for an AHI threshold of 10, respec. 
tively) increased in parallel to the increase. 
threshold of AHI (Table 1). This permit. 
physicians to readily identify patients wit. 
an AHI above 40, with greater sensitivit. 
(100%) and specificity (87%) than for . 
lower AHI threshold value. The NPV like. 
wise tended to increase with the severity o. 
the disturbance, thereby highlighting the rar. 
ity of a negative test for a high AHI valu. 
obtained by PSG. We conclude that AS ca. 
be useful in the assessment of patients wit. 
high pre-test clinical probability of OSA wh. 
cannot be submitted to standard PSG as th. 
first step toward diagnosis.
