Snoring in preschool children: prevalence, 
severity and risk factors 

C.E. Kuehni*, M-P.F. Strippoli*, E.S. Chauliac* and M. Silverman# 
ABSTRACT: Epidemiological data on snoring from preschool children are scarce, although 
habitual snoring (snoring on almost all nights) has been associated with poor long-term 
outcomes. 

In a population survey of 6,811 children aged 1–4 yrs (from Leicestershire, UK) the present 
authors determined prevalence, severity and risk factors for snoring, especially habitual snoring. 

In 59.7% of the children, parents reported snoring in the previous 12 months, including 7.9% 
with habitual snoring and 0.9% with habitual snoring and sleep disturbance. Prevalence of 
habitual snoring increased with age from 6.6% in 1-yr-olds to 13.0% in 4-yr-olds. Habitual snoring 
was associated with: one and both parents smoking (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.46 and 2.09, 
respectively); road traffic (OR 1.23); single parent (OR 1.60); and in White but not South Asian 
children, socioeconomic deprivation (OR 1.25 and 2.03 for middle and upper thirds of Townsend 
score, respectively). Respiratory tract symptoms related to atopic disorders and to respiratory 
infections were strongly associated with snoring; however, body mass index was not. 

In conclusion, habitual snoring is common in preschool children with one-third of cases 
attributable to avoidable risk factors. The strong association with atopic disorders, viral infections 
and environmental exposures suggests a complex aetiology, based on a general vulnerability of 
the respiratory tract.

country of birth and language, to select an age-stratified 
random sample of White and South Asian (mother self-
identified as Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi or other) children 
aged 1–4 yrs with complete birth records. From this database a 
random sample of 6,100 White and 2,600 South Asian children 
(5,400 aged 1 yr and 1,100 in each age group of 2, 3 and 4 yrs) 
was extracted [22]. The Leicestershire Health Authority 
Research Ethics Committee (Leicester, UK) approved the 
study. 

Questionnaire 

Parents were sent a single questionnaire including questions 
on wheeze, cough and upper respiratory symptoms during the 
past 12 months [23–25]. The questions for 1-yr-olds and their 
repeatability have been published elsewhere [25]. The questionnaire 
for 2–5-yr-olds was almost identical and is available 
from the present authors. The following questions related to 
snoring. ‘‘Over the past 12 months, has your child snored at 
night? If yes how often, only with a cold/sometimes even 
without a cold/almost always?’’ and ‘‘Did the snoring disturb 
your child’s sleep, not at all/a little/a moderate amount/a 
lot?’’ [6, 7]. 

The questionnaire also contained sections on diagnoses, 
healthcare utilisation and treatments for wheeze, environmental 
exposures, breastfeeding, pets, nursery care, siblings and 
household members, parental history of atopic diseases, 
ethnicity and language. Socioeconomic factors were measured 
at a family level (duration of parental education, number of 
people per room, single parenthood) and area level (Townsend 
score, 1991 census data). 

Height and weight measurements were available through the 
Leicestershire Health Authority Child Health Database, 
assessed in a standardised way by health visitors at birth 
and at 8, 20, 40 and 60 months. For the analysis, the 
measurements at birth and those made nearest to the date of 
the questionnaire were used. The standard deviation score 
(SDS) for the body mass index (BMI) was calculated from 
British growth reference curves [26]. International BMI cut-offs 
were used to define underweight, overweight and obesity in 
children [27]. The ponderal index (cube root of body mass (kg) 
divided by height of the children (cm)) was also calculated. 

Statistical analysis 

Based on reported frequency of snoring, children were 
grouped into four categories: 1) nonsnorers; 2) children 
snoring only with colds; 3) children snoring also apart from 
colds; and 4) children snoring almost always. The latter were 
classified as HS [1, 6, 7]. Descriptive analysis was used to 
summarise characteristics of the subjects according to snoring 
category (table 1). 

To quantify associations between potential risk factors and 
different categories of snoring multivariable logistic regression 
models were used. The main analysis compared HS with 
nonsnorers. As the present authors hypothesised that the 
aetiology of HS might differ from the aetiology of less frequent 
snoring, separate logistic regression models were used to 
compare the other two snoring categories with nonsnorers. 

In addition to age, sex and ethnicity, the following variables 
were considered for inclusion in the models. 1) Environmental 

SNORING IN PRESCHOOL CHILDREN 

exposures: including maternal smoking during pregnancy (yes/ 
no), current parental smoking (none, one parent, both parents), 
electrical cooking (yes/no), central heating (yes/no), reported 
exposure to road traffic (moderate-to-dense/little-to-none), 
household pets (cats, dogs, birds or rabbits, guinea pigs etc., all 
categorised as yes/no), number of siblings, nursery care (yes/ 
no) and breastfeeding (.6 months). 2) Socioeconomic factors: 
including the Townsend score, paternal and maternal education 
(completed full-time education at f16 yrs), single parenthood, 
overcrowding (.1person?room -1). 3) Clinical features and 
symptoms: including parental history of atopic disease, upper 
and lower respiratory symptoms in the child, prevalence and 
frequency of wheeze, chronic cough, chronic rhinitis, frequency 
and severity of colds, eczema, birth weight, BMI and ponderal 
index at the time of the questionnaire. The authors also asked 
about ‘‘posseting’’ in the first year of life (regurgitation, a 
common form of gastro-oesophageal reflux in infants). 

To explore potential causal pathways, three logistic regression 
models were developed with increasing complexity. First, a 
simple model, adjusted only for age, sex and ethnic group 
(tables 2 and 3; base model). Secondly, a model that was 
adjusted for all environmental and socioeconomic factors 
(table 2; partially adjusted model I), and a model that was 
adjusted for other clinical and biological features (table 3; 
partially adjusted model II). Thirdly, a model adjusting for 
environmental, social and clinical conditions simultaneously 
(tables 2 and 3; fully adjusted model). All variables associated 
with prevalence of HS (p,0.05) in one model were included in 
the next modelling step, except when the information 
contained in two or more variables was so similar (co-linear) 
that only one could be taken into the next modelling step. This 
was, for instance, the case for paternal and maternal education, 
current maternal smoking and smoking during pregnancy, and 
Townsend score and household size (crowding). Results are 
presented as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals 
(CI). Based on literature and previous findings [28], the current 
authors hypothesised that risk factors might differ between 
ethnic groups (South Asians/Whites), between young males 
and young females, and between age groups (1-yr-olds/2–5yr-
olds). Therefore, stratified analyses were performed and 
evidence for heterogeneity between groups was tested for 
using interaction terms. Because South Asian children and 1yr-
olds had been over-sampled weighted, analyses were also 
performed, which accounted for the sampling scheme. As the 
results were similar to the main analysis, unweighted results 
are reported for simplicity. 

The population-attributable risk fraction, or proportion of HS 
that could be prevented if the associations were causal and the 
risk factors were eliminated completely from the population, 
was calculated from the logistic regression framework by using 
the aflogit command in STATA [29], which allows confounders 
to be taken into account. 

RESULTS 

The overall response rate was 80% (6,811 out of the 8,500 
families with a valid address), and was higher in White (4,986 
(84%)) than in South Asian (1,825 (72%)) families, corresponding 
to 16 and 29% of White and South Asian children aged 1– 
5 yrs living in Leicestershire (UK) at the time. In total, 69 (1%) c

Prevalence and severity of all categories of snoring 

In total, parents of 4,028 (59.7%) children reported that their 
child had snored in the previous 12 months; including 1,862 
(27.6%) children snoring only with colds, 1,635 (24.2%) snoring 
sometimes apart from colds, and 531 (7.9%) snoring almost 
always (HS). HS was more common in young males, White 
children and 2–4-yr-olds compared with younger children 
(table 1; online supplementary tables E1A and E1B). This was 
similar for snoring sometimes without colds, while snoring 
only with colds was reported more often for younger children, 
with no sex difference. For 44 children, an operation to remove 
adenoids and/or tonsils was reported (none of the 1-yr-olds, 
and 4 (0.5%), 13 (1.5%) and 27 (3.0%) of children aged 2, 3 and 
4 yrs, respectively). Moderate or severe sleep disturbance due 
to snoring was reported most often for HS (60 (11.3%) out of 
530 of all HS), while mild sleep disturbance was reported more 
often for children snoring only with colds (fig. 1). In total, 
parents of 60 (0.9%) children reported HS with moderate or 
severe sleep disturbance. Otitis media in the past 12 months 
was reported by 34.6% of nonsnorers, 42.2% of children 
snoring only with colds, 48.1% of children snoring sometimes 
without colds and 52.5% of HS (p,0.001). For recurrent otitis 
media, these figures were 13.4, 17.0, 21.3 and 27.3%, respectively 
(p,0.001). 

Association between HS and environmental and 
socioeconomic factors 

Adjusting only for age, sex and ethnic group (base model), HS 
was reported more often in children exposed to air pollutants 
(environmental tobacco smoke, reported road traffic, absence 
of central heating and of electric cooking; table 2). In the fully 
adjusted model, only the effect of parental smoking remained 
significant with OR for HS of 1.43 if one and 2.06 if both 
parents smoked. The association was stronger in 1-yr-olds than 
in older children (OR 2.10 and 3.14 in 1-yr-olds, and 1.22 and 

1.47 in 2–4-yr-olds for one and two smokers respectively; p for 
interaction50.010). Maternal smoking during pregnancy was 
also strongly associated with HS (OR (95% CI) in base model 
2.10 (1.66–2.67); p,0.001). As the same females smoked during 
pregnancy and at the time of the survey, it was not possible to 
distinguish the effects of pre-natal and current smoke 
exposure, and only one variable chosen for current smoking 
could be included in the adjusted models. A longer duration of 
breastfeeding was associated with a lower prevalence of 
snoring (OR in base model: 0.73 (0.57–0.95)), but the association 
disappeared after adjustment for parental smoking and was 
not age dependent. 
HS was reported more often for children from disadvantaged 
families, with a single parent, overcrowded households or 
low paternal or maternal education. The area-based deprivation 
measure (Townsend score) was associated with HS in 
White, but not in South Asian preschool children (p for

interaction ,0.001). Adjusting simultaneously for environmental 
exposures and socioeconomic factors, parental smoking, 
traffic exposure, single parenthood and Townsend score in 
whites remained independent predictors of HS (table 2; 
partially adjusted model I). When adjusting additionally for 
clinical features (table 2; fully adjusted model) the strength of 
the association (OR) between snoring and environmental 
exposures decreased, but did not disappear. When children 
with current wheeze or asthma were excluded from the 
analysis, the associations with environmental factors were 
similar to the model including all children (data not shown). 

Using a statistical approach that allowed multiple risk factors 
to be taken into account [29], a total of 33.4% of HS could be 
attributed to air pollutants (20% to parental smoking, 15% to 
exposure to road traffic and 3% to lack of central heating). 

These analyses were repeated for the less severe categories of 
snoring. Snoring sometimes without colds was associated, 
although less strongly, with the same environmental exposures 
as HS (online supplementary table E2A). Snoring only with 
colds was only weakly associated with current parental 
smoking and reported road traffic, but not with the other 
exposures (online supplementary table E2B). 

Association between HS and clinical and biological 
features 

Habitual snoring was strongly associated with a large number 
of clinical conditions. This included conditions potentially 
related to atopy, such as maternal history of asthma and a 

personal history of wheeze, eczema, chronic night cough and 
chronic rhinitis. However, snoring was also independently 
associated with symptoms related to viral infection, such as 
frequency of colds and otitis media, and with posseting 
(regurgitation) in the first year of life (table 3; base model 
and partially adjusted model II). These associations remained 
essentially unchanged after additional adjustment for environmental 
exposures and socioeconomic factors, suggesting that 
they were not explained by confounding with exposures, such 
as parental smoking, that increase the risk for both snoring and 
other respiratory conditions (table 3; fully adjusted model). 

BMI was not associated with HS, either when analysed as a 
continuous variable (OR 1.03 (95% CI 0.95–1.12); by SDS 
p50.42) or as a categorical variable [27] (table 3; base model). 
Similarly, no association was found between HS and ponderal 
index at the time of the study (p50.46 when analysed as a 
continuous variable, p50.57 when analysed as tertiles), or birth 
weight (p50.93 and p50.88, respectively, when analysed as a 
continuous or categorical variable). 

These analyses were repeated comparing the milder categories 
of snorers with nonsnorers. For children snoring sometimes 
apart form colds (online supplementary table E3A) the results 
were very similar to those with HS. For children snoring only 
with colds (online supplementary table E3B) the associations 
with other respiratory symptoms and posseting were similar to 
those for more severe snoring, while the association with 
atopic disorders was less consistent.

Sensitivity analyses 

The associations with environmental exposures and clinical 
features were similar for young females and young males, and 
for White and South Asian children (all p-values for interaction 
terms .0.01) Similarly, a weighted analysis adjusting for over 
sampling of young children and those of South Asian origin 
gave similar results to the main analysis. 

DISCUSSION 

In this large representative survey, 60% of preschool children 
were reported to have snored in the previous year, 8% were 
HSs and 11% of these (almost 1% of the cohort) were HSs with 
significant sleep disturbance, a group at risk of long-term 
neurobehavioural problems [3–5]. Assuming a causal association, 
approximately one-third of cases with HS might be 
attributable to avoidable environmental exposures (parental 
smoking and traffic exposure). Snoring was associated both 
with clinical features of atopic disease and with symptoms 
caused by viral infections. 

Methodological issues 

This cross-sectional survey is the largest community-based 
study of snoring in children ,5 yrs of age and the only one 
covering the age range 1–4 yrs. Most other publications focused 
on 3–5-yr-olds and included only a few hundred subjects [9–12]. 
The present authors studied a community-based sample of

children, had a good response rate and included South Asians, 
the largest ethnic minority group in the UK. Therefore, the 
results should be representative of UK toddlers. A large number 
of environmental exposures, socioeconomic factors and clinical 
features were assessed. 

A limitation shared with other community-based surveys is 
the lack of objective outcomes. In this cohort, the present 
authors assessed whether the families understood the different 
respiratory symptoms listed in the questionnaire and, although 
it was found that some parents confused wheeze with rattly 
breathing or cough, snoring was clearly distinguished both by 
White and South Asian parents [24]. Moreover, a recent study 
showed that parental reports of frequent snoring were highly 
sensitive and specific when compared with overnight polysomnography 
[2]. Although the latter remains the ‘‘gold 
standard’’ for the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnoea 
syndrome and SDB [1] it is clearly impractical for a large 
population survey, as are methods such as overnight pulse 
oximetry, audio and videotaping. Several recent studies have 
shown strong associations between reported habitual snoring 
in children and adults and adverse behavioural and academic 
outcomes, even in the absence of intermittent hypoxia [1, 4, 5, 
30]. This may be due to increased sleep fragmentation. 
Considering all this, the current authors believe that parent-
reported HS can be used as a simple indicator of clinically 
relevant disease. 

Prevalence of snoring in preschool children 

As assessment of snoring by questionnaire has not been 
standardised, differences in reported prevalence between 
studies are unavoidable. In common with other surveys [6, 7] 
a question on snoring frequency in the past 12 months was 
used, with the answer categories: never; only with colds; 
sometimes apart from colds; and almost always. Other studies 
asked if snoring occurred ‘‘never’’, ‘‘rarely’’, ‘‘frequently’’ or 
‘‘always’’, without differentiating between snoring with or 
without colds. In spite of the differences in wording, the 
prevalence of HS in the current study (7% in 1-yr-olds, 
increasing to 13% in 4-yr-olds) was comparable to data from 
4–5-yr-olds in the UK (12%) [10], from 2–5-yr-olds in Australia 
(11%) [12], and from schoolchildren (5–10%) [6, 7, 9, 31]. The 

schoolchildren (35–64%) [6, 7, 9, 31]. An increasing prevalence 
of HS from 1–4-yr-olds has not previously been reported and 
might be due to age-dependent increments in adenoid size, 
which peak at 7–10 yrs of age [32]. In adults, the prevalence of 
HS is higher in males. For children, published data are less 
consistent, with some studies reporting a sex difference [7, 14– 
16, 18] and others none [6, 8, 11]. The present authors found a 
slightly higher prevalence in young males (OR 1.33). 

Studies from the USA report an increased prevalence in 
African-Americans compared with Whites [17, 19]. In the 
current study, South Asian children, the largest ethnic minority 
group in the UK, had a lower crude prevalence. This difference 
remained after adjusting for other clinical conditions, (table 3; 
partially adjusted model II) but disappeared after adjustment 
for differences in parental smoking and socioeconomic factors 
(table 3; fully adjusted model). This suggests that the differences 
in prevalence between ethnic groups might be caused by 
differences in environmental exposures rather than biological 
factors. 

Association with environmental exposures and 
socioeconomic factors 

An association between snoring and passive smoking has been 
demonstrated for adults [33] and children [7, 18], sometimes 
disappearing after adjustment for social class [17]. The current 
authors confirmed a strong and dose-dependent effect of 
parental smoking (both versus one smoking parent) on 
frequency of snoring even after adjustment for socioeconomic 
factors. This dose–response relationship and the fact that the 
association was stronger in younger children who spend more 
time at home and who might be more vulnerable support a 
causal association. The present analysis suggests that approximately 
one in five cases of HS could be avoided if parents did 
not smoke. Because of the close correlation between pre-natal 
and post-natal smoke exposures it was not possible to 
distinguish their effects. 

HS was also more common in households that had no central 
heating, used gas for cooking and were exposed to greater road 
traffic. These are new findings. Although the authors found 
that some of these effects disappeared after adjustment for the 
Townsend score, this might be an over-adjustment because 

total prevalence of snoring in the current sample (60%) was area-based deprivation scores are closely associated with 
similar to data from preschool children (70%) [10] and housing conditions and air pollution. The increased prevalence

SNORING IN PRESCHOOL CHILDREN 

of snoring in children from disadvantaged families was only 
partially explained by a higher exposure to parental smoking 
and air pollutants. Other unmeasured lifestyle variables, such 
as nutrition, must also play a role. 

Association with clinical features 

A strong association was found between snoring and other 
upper and lower respiratory symptoms. This was not only the 
case for symptoms associated with atopy (wheeze, eczema, 
maternal asthma), which has been reported by others [6, 12, 18, 
34], but also for symptoms that are usually associated with 
infection (frequent colds, otitis media). 

Therefore, it was hypothesised that, as in other airway 
disorders, snoring might result from an interaction between 
underlying host predisposition, various intrinsic mechanisms 
and external triggers, which together lead to a similar endpoint. 
The present authors propose a tentative model (fig. 2), 
which will be revised as further evidence accumulates. Chronic 
snoring in children might arise via several inflammatory 
pathways which independently affect upper airway resistance 
or compliance. For some mechanisms, such as atopy, there is a 
simple explanation for the association between upper and 
lower airway vulnerability. Increased susceptibility to viral 
respiratory infection may be another. A hypothetical mechanism 
for such susceptibility has been proposed [35]. GOLDBART et 
al. [35] provide evidence that early exposure to respiratory 
syncytial virus might induce neuro-immunomodulatory 
changes within adenotonsillar tissue, predisposing to an 
accelerated proliferative response and, hence, enlargement 
when exposed to other stimuli such as viruses or allergens. 

An association between HS and gastro-oesophageal reflux has 
been reported for adults [36]. For children, an association with 
posseting is a new finding. This physiological form of gastrooesophageal 
reflux is largely confined to the first year of life, 
and cannot therefore be directly related to snoring later in 
childhood. However, it may be speculated that intermittent 
contact with gastric juices leads to chronic pharyngeal 
inflammation, possibly predisposing to snoring by altered 
compliance or calibre of the upper airways. 

No association was found between snoring and overweight or 
obesity, whether assessed by BMI or ponderal index. This is 
unlikely to be due to lack of statistical power. However, there 
are data suggesting that the association between obesity and 
snoring might change with age [20] and that BMI might play a 
minor role in the aetiology of snoring in preschool children, in 
contrast to adolescence and adulthood [12, 17, 18]. In young 
children, with relatively noncollapsible upper airways, obesity 
per se might not elicit the noise of snoring. 

Conclusions 

In total, it was found that 60% of preschool children had 
snored during the past 12 months, with 8% snoring habitually 
and nearly 1% reporting habitual snoring with sleep disturbance, 
the latter representing children at risk of adverse 
consequences. Risk factors for habitual snoring in this age 
group were exposure to parental smoking, other air pollutants 
and socioeconomic deprivation, but not overweight. The 
strong association with a number of other upper and lower 
respiratory symptoms, both those associated with atopy and 

C.E. KUEHNI ET AL. 
those associated with viral infection, suggests common pathways, 
such as increased host susceptibility in the respiratory 
tract.
