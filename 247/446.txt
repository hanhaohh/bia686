Objective: 
To 
study 
the 
behavior 
of 
children 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
syndrome 
(OSAS) 
before 
and 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
using 
a 
standardized 
behavioral 
rating 
scale 
completed 
by 
caregivers. 
Design 
and 
Setting: 
Prospective 
study 
of 
children 
with 
OSAS 
at 
the 
University 
of 
New 
Mexico 
Children’s 
Hospital, 
Albuquerque, 
New 
Mexico. 
Methods: 
Children 
between 
2.5 
and 
18 
years 
of 
age 
were 
included 
in 
the 
study 
and 
underwent 
adenotonsillectomy 
if 
the 
results 
of 
polysomnography 
showed 
an 
obstructive 
apnea/hypopnea 
index 
(AHI) 
of 
5 
or 
greater. 
Caregivers 
completed 
the 
Behavior 
Assessment 
System 
for 
Children 
(BASC) 
before 
surgery 
and 
a 
second 
time 
within 
6 
months 
of 
surgery. 
Pre-and 
postoperative 
BASC 
t 
scores 
were 
compared 
using 
a 
paired 
t 
test. 
Repeated 
measures 
analysis 
of 
variance 
was 
used 
to 
evaluate 
the 
contributions 
of 
several 
covariants 
to 
these 
change 
scores. 
Results: 
The 
study 
population 
included 
52 
children. 
The 
mean 
age 
was 
7.1 
(range 
2.5–14.9) 
years, 
and 
the 
mean 
AHI 
was 
16.2 
(range 
5.0 
– 
88.0). 
Preoperative 
mean 
BASC 
t 
scores 
for 
all 
behavioral 
scales 
and 
composites 
were 
greater 
than 
50. 
The 
behavioral 
scales 
that 
showed 
significant 
improvement 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
were 
aggression, 
atypicality, 
depression, 
hyperactivity, 
and 
somatization 
(p 
< 
.001). 
Age, 
ethnicity, 
parental 
education, 
parental 
income, 
and 
AHI 
were 
not 
correlated 
with 
changes 
in 
BASC 
scores. 
Conclusions: 
A 
high 
proportion 
of 
children 
with 
OSAS 
have 
externalizing 
(hyperactivity 
and 
aggression) 
and 
internalizing 
(anxiety, 
depression, 
and 
somatization) 
behavioral 
problems. 
These 
problems 
improve 
significantly 
after 
adenotonsillectomy. 
The 
improvement 
is 
dramatic 
regardless 
of 
sex, 
age, 
ethnicity,

INTRODUCTION 


Sleep 
disorders 
in 
children 
may 
cause 
behavioral 
problems 
and 
diminish 
neurocognitive 
skills. 
Previous 
studies 
of 
children 
have 
shown 
that 
inattention, 
hyperactivity, 
aggression, 
reduced 
memory, 
and 
lower 
IQ 
scores 
may 
be 
associated 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
syndrome 
(OSAS).1 
In 
addition, 
several 
studies 
have 
examined 
the 
effects 
of 
surgical 
therapy 
for 
OSAS 
on 
behavior 
in 
children. 
Gozal2 
studied 
first-grade 
children 
who 
were 
poor 
academic 
performers 
and 
showed 
that 
school 
grades 
increased 
significantly 
1 
year 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSAS. 
Goldstein 
et 
al.3,4 
and 
Ali 
et 
al.5 
noted 
reduced 
aggression, 
inattention, 
and 
hyperactivity 
in 
children 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSAS. 
Owens 
et 
al.6 
studied 
eight 
children 
with 
OSAS 
and 
found 
an 
improvement 
in 
parental 
reports 
of 
abnormal 
internalizing 
and 
externalizing 
behaviors 
after 
adenotonsillectomy. 


Sleep-disordered 
breathing 
in 
children 
ranges 
in 
severity 
from 
snoring 
caused 
by 
partial 
obstruction 
of 
the 
airway 
to 
OSAS 
caused 
by 
episodes 
of 
complete 
airway 
obstruction. 
In 
previous 
studies 
that 
have 
linked 
OSAS 
with 
behavioral 
problems 
in 
children, 
clinical 
criteria 
were 
used 
to 
identify 
the 
specific 
sleep 
disorder.2–4 
These 
criteria 
are 
known 
to 
be 
poor 
predictors 
of 
the 
presence 
or 
severity 
of 
OSAS.7 
The 
most 
accurate 
method 
for 
the 
diagnosis 
of 
OSAS 
is 
full-night 
polysomnography.8 
Therefore, 
in 
the 
present 
study, 
only 
children 
with 
OSAS 
documented 
by 
polysomnography 
were 
included. 


The 
Behavior 
Assessment 
System 
for 
Children 
(BASC)9 
is 
a 
comprehensive 
instrument 
for 
the 
evaluation 
of 
child 
behavior. 
It 
is 
designed 
specifically 
to 
quantify 
emotional 
and 
behavioral 
problems 
in 
children 
as 
well 
as 
their 
adaptive 
and 
social 
skills. 
BASC 
has 
high 
internal 
consistency 
and 
good 
test-retest 
reliability.9 
In 
the 
present 
study, 
child 
behavior 
was 
evaluated 
with 
BASC 
before 
and 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSAS. 
The 
initial 
goal 
was 
to 
establish 
the 
BASC 
scales 
and 
composites 
that 
are 
affected 
by 
OSAS. 
The 
principal 
aim, 
however, 
was 
to 
establish 
changes 
in 
behavioral

MATERIALS 
AND 
METHODS 


Approval 
for 
this 
study 
was 
obtained 
from 
the 
institutional 
review 
board 
of 
the 
University 
of 
New 
Mexico 
School 
of 
Medicine, 
Albuquerque, 
New 
Mexico. 
Children 
referred 
to 
the 
Pediatric 
Otolaryngology 
Service 
with 
a 
sleep 
disturbance 
between 
July 
1, 
2000 
and 
June 
30, 
2003 
were 
included 
in 
the 
study 
if 
they 
had 
OSAS 
and 
caregivers 
gave 
informed 
consent. 
Exclusion 
criteria 
included 
1) 
children 
younger 
than 
2.5 
or 
older 
than 
18 
years; 
2) 
children 
who 
previously 
had 
an 
adenotonsillectomy; 
3) 
children 
with 
craniofacial 
syndromes, 
neuromuscular 
disease, 
developmental 
delay, 
or 
psychiatric 
disorders; 
and 
4) 
children 
with 
an 
apnea/hypopnea 
index 
(AHI) 
less 
than 
5. 


All 
study 
participants 
underwent 
full-night 
polysomnography,
10 
and 
a 
sleep 
medicine 
physician 
interpreted 
the 
results. 
The 
following 
parameters 
were 
measured: 
four-channel 
electroencephalography 
with 
bilateral 
central 
and 
occipital 
leads; 
electro-oculography 
to 
measure 
vertical 
and 
horizontal 
eye 
movements; 
electromyography 
with 
submental 
electrodes; 
electrocardiography; 
airflow 
recording 
through 
the 
nose 
and 
mouth 
by 
a 
nasal 
air 
pressure 
transducer 
with 
end 
tidal 
CO2; 
thoracic 
and 
abdominal 
effort 
by 
piezoelectric 
sensors; 
oxygen 
saturation 
through 
pulse 
oximetry; 
and 
tracheal 
sound 
recording 
by 
using 
a 
microphone 
secured 
to 
the 
neck. 
Digital 
videotaping 
with 
sound 
recording 
was 
performed 
throughout 
the 
night. 
Obstructive 
apnea 
was 
defined 
as 
a 
cessation 
of 
airflow 
through 
the 
nose 
and 
mouth 
for 
at 
least 
two 
respiratory 
cycles 
with 
paradoxical 
chest 
and 
abdominal 
movements. 
Hypopnea 
was 
defined 
as 
a 
reduction 
in 
airflow 
through 
the 
nose 
and 
mouth 
with 
paradoxical 
respiratory 
effort 
resulting 
in 
either 
an 
arousal 
or 
an 
oxyhemoglobin 
desaturation 
of 
at 
least 
4%. 
The 
AHI, 
defined 
as 
the 
average 
number 
of 
obstructive 
apneas 
and 
hypopneas 
per 
hour 
of 
sleep, 
was 
used 
for 
diagnosis. 
OSAS 
was 
defined 
as 
an 
AHI 
greater 
than 
or 
equal 
to 
5. 
Children 
with 
OSAS 
underwent 
a 
monopolar 
adenotonsillectomy. 
The 
tonsillectomy 
was 
performed 
with 
a 
combination 
of 
sharp 
and 
blunt 
dissection 
using 
primarily 
a 
blade 
electrocautery. 
Adenoidectomy 
was 
performed 
using 
suction 
ablation 
and 
cautery. 


Caregivers 
were 
asked 
to 
complete 
the 
BASC 
survey 
before 
surgery 
and 
a 
second 
time 
within 
6 
months 
of 
surgery. 
Specific 
BASC 
instruments 
were 
used 
for 
the 
following 
age 
groups; 
2.5 
to 
5 
years; 
6 
to 
11 
years; 
and 
12 
to 
18 
years. 
The 
BASC 
behavioral 
scales 
are 
aggression, 
anxiety, 
attention 
problems, 
atypicality, 
depression, 
hyperactivity, 
somatization, 
and 
withdrawal. 
BASC 
composite 
scales 
are 
made 
up 
of 
several 
behavioral 
scales 
that 
are 
weighted 
differently 
as 
a 
function 
of 
age. 
This 
weighting 
reflects 
the 
relative 
contribution 
of 
individual 
scales 
to 
problem 
behaviors 
in 
different 
age 
groups. 
The 
composite 
scales 
are 
the 
behavioral 
symptoms 
index 
(BSI), 
externalizing 
problems, 
and 
internalizing 
problems.9 
Only 
BASC 
scales 
and 
composites 
that 
were 
applicable 
to 
all 
age 
groups 
were 
included 
in 
this 
study. 
Responses 
to 
each 
question 
were 
scored 
as 
follows: 
never 
occurs 
. 
0; 
sometimes 
occurs 
. 
1; 
often 
occurs 
. 
2; 
almost 
always 
occurs 
. 
3. 
Raw 
scores 
on 
the 
BASC 
scales 
and 
composites 
were 
converted 
to 
t 
scores 
with 
a 
mean 
of 
50 
and 
a 
SD 
of 
10. 
Children 
who 
scored 
from 
60 
to 
69 
were 
considered 
to 
have 
“borderline” 
behavioral 
impairment. 
Children 
who 
scored 
70 
or 
above 
were 
considered 
to 
have 
“clinically 
significant” 
behavioral 
impairment.9 


BASC 
t 
scores 
were 
compared 
before 
and 
after 
surgery 
using 
a 
paired 
t 
test. 
A 
P 
value 
less 
than 
or 
equal 
to 
.05 
was 
considered 
significant. 
Children 
were 
also 
divided 
into 
three 
groups 
based 
on 
preoperative 
BASC 
scores: 
normal, 
t 
score 
less 
than 
60; 
borderline, 
t 
score 
greater 
than 
or 
equal 
to 
60 
but 
less 
than 
70; 
and 
clinically 
significant, 
t 
score 
greater 
than 
or 
equal 
to 


70. 
This 
was 
done 
to 
determine 
the 
number 
of 
children 
who 
remained 
borderline 
or 
clinically 
significant 
after 
surgery. 
Children 
with 
BASC 
scales 
and 
composites 
that 
were 
significantly 
different 
after 
surgery 
were 
analyzed 
further 
using 
repeated 
measures 
analysis 
of 
variance 
(ANOVA). 
The 
following 
covariates 
were 
evaluated: 
sex; 
age 
group; 
ethnic 
group; 
parental 
education; 
parental 
income; 
and 
AHI. 
SAS 
procedures 
(SAS 
Corp., 
Carey, 
NC) 
were 
used 
for 
statistical 
analyses. 
A 
power 
analysis 
indicated 
that 
a 
sample 
size 
of 
20 
is 
adequate 
to 
detect 
a 
10 
point 
difference 
in 
BASC 
t 
scores 
with 
80% 
power 
and 
. 
. 
0.05. 
Becasue 
a 
difference 
of 
10 
in 
a 
BASC 
t 
score 
is 
clinically 
significant,9 
the 
present 
study 
has 
sufficient 
power 
to 
detect 
a 
significant 
change 
in 
behavior. 


RESULTS 


The 
initial 
study 
population 
comprised 
74 
children. 
Caregivers 
for 
22 
children 
did 
not 
complete 
the 
postoperative 
BASC 
instrument. 
As 
a 
consequence, 
the 
final 
study 
population 
included 
52 
children, 
29 
(56%) 
of 
whom 
were 
male. 
The 
mean 
age 
of 
the 
children 
at 
the 
time 
of 
inclusion 
in 
the 
study 
was 
7.1 
(range 
2.5–14.9) 
years. 
Twenty-nine 
(56%) 
children 
were 
Hispanic 
or 
Latino; 
15 
(29%) 
children 
were 
non-Hispanic 
or 
Latino 
white, 
5 
(10%) 
children 
were 
Native 
Americans, 
1 
(2%) 
child 
was 
black, 
and 
1 
(2%) 
child 
was 
Asian. 
Ethnicity 
was 
not 
identified 
in 
one 
child. 
The 
mean 
AHI 
was 
16.2 
(range 
5.0 
–88.0). 
On 
the 
basis 
of 
preoperative 
age-and 
sex-corrected 
body 
mass 
index 
percentiles, 
4 
(8%) 
children 
were 
underweight, 
28 
(54%) 
were 
of 
normal 
weight, 
7 
(13%) 
were 
at 
risk 
of 
being 
overweight, 
and 
13 
(25%) 
were 
overweight.11 


The 
mean 
interval 
between 
polysomnography 
and 
surgery 
was 
4.1 
months. 
The 
mean 
interval 
between 
completion 
of 
the 
preoperative 
BASC 
instrument 
and 
surgery 
was 
1.6 
months. 
The 
mean 
interval 
between 
surgery 
and 
completion 
of 
the 
postoperative 
BASC 
instrument 
was 
4.4 
months. 


Preoperative 
mean 
BASC 
t 
scores 
and 
standard 
deviations, 
postoperative 
mean 
change 
scores 
and 
95% 
confidence 
intervals, 
and 
P 
values 
for 
differences 
in 
pre-and 
postoperative 
t 
scores 
are 
presented 
in 
Table 
I. 
Preoperative 
mean 
t 
scores 
for 
all 
scales 
and 
composites 
were 
greater 
than 
50. 
Somatization 
was 
the 
only 
behavioral 
scale 
with 
a 
preoperative 
mean 
t 
score 
greater 
than 
60. 
The 
behavioral 
scales 
that 
showed 
significant 
improvement 
after 
surgery 
were 
aggression, 
atypicality, 
depression, 
hyperactivity, 
and 
somatization 
(Table 
I). 
The 
three 
composite 
indices 
all 
showed 
a 
significant 
change 
after 
surgery 
(Table 
I). 


Data 
for 
BASC 
scales 
and 
composites 
for 
normal, 
borderline, 
and 
clinically 
significant 
children 
are 
summarized 
in 
Table 
II. 
The 
improvement 
after 
surgery 
was 
most 
dramatic 
for 
children 
with 
BASC 
t 
scores 
that 
indicated 
clinically 
significant 
impairment. 
For 
aggression, 
anxiety, 
depression, 
and 
hyperactivity, 
there 
were 
no 
children 
with 
severe 
impairment 
after 
adenotonsillectomy. 
The 
most 
dramatic 
difference 
after 
surgery 
was 
seen 
for 
depression. 
Preoperatively, 
35 
children 
had 
scores 
within 
the 
normal 
range, 
7 
had 
mild 
impairment, 
and 
10 
had 
severe 
impairment. 
Postoperatively, 
47 
children 
had 
scores 
within 
the 
normal 
range, 
5 
had 
mild 
impairment, 
and 
none 
had 
severe 
impairment.

DISCUSSION 


The 
present 
study 
shows 
that 
children 
with 
OSAS 
had 
behavioral 
problems 
documented 
by 
BASC 
that 
include 
hyperactivity, 
aggression, 
anxiety, 
depression, 
somatization, 
atypicality, 
withdrawal, 
and 
attention 
prob


lems. 
The 
BSI, 
a 
total 
behavioral 
score, 
showed 
mild 
to 
severe 
behavioral 
impairment 
in 
37% 
of 
the 
children 
in 
the 
study. 
In 
the 
majority 
of 
children 
with 
behavioral 
problems, 
t 
scores 
placed 
them 
in 
the 
“borderline” 
rather 
than 
the 
“clinically 
significant” 
category. 
Nearly 
all 
children 
improved 
after 
adenotonsillectomy. 
The 
relative 
improvement 
was 
greatest 
for 
children 
in 
the 
“clinically 
significant” 
category. 


In 
a 
pilot 
study, 
Goldstein 
et 
al.3 
showed 
that 
28% 
of 
children 
with 
OSAS 
scored 
in 
the 
abnormal 
range 
on 
the 
Achenbach 
Child 
Behavior 
Checklist 
(CBCL), 
a 
standardized 
behavioral 
assessment, 
and 
that 
these 
scores 
improved 
significantly 
after 
adenotonsillectomy. 
A 
more 
complete 
study 
by 
Goldstein 
et 
al.4 
of 
64 
children 
with 
OSAS 
showed 
that 
25% 
scored 
in 
the 
abnormal 
range 
on 
the 
same 
behavioral 
assessment, 
with 
a 
similar 
significantly 
improvement 
after 
surgery.

ing 
the 
attention 
scales 
of 
the 
CBCL. 
They 
did 
not 
report 
the 
percentage 
of 
children 
with 
abnormal 
scores 
preoperatively, 
but 
a 
significant 
improvement 
in 
attention 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSAS 
was 
noted. 
However, 
none 
of 
these 
studies 
used 
polysomnography 
to 
diagnose 
OSAS, 
and 
it 
is 
likely 
that 
children 
with 
milder 
forms 
of 
OSAS 
were 
included. 
In 
the 
present 
study, 
37% 
of 
the 
children 
with 
OSAS 
documented 
by 
polysomnography 
had 
BASC 
t 
scores 
that 
indicated 
behavioral 
problems. 
This 
percentage 
probably 
reflects 
the 
higher 
prevalence 
of 
behavioral 
problems 
among 
children 
with 
OSAS. 
It 
could 
also, 
however, 
be 
a 
consequence 
of 
differences 
in 
the 
behavioral 
assessment 
instruments 
used 
in 
the 
previous 
studies. 
Goldstein 
et 
al.4 
also 
showed 
that 
parental 
education 
level 
is 
the 
only 
sociodemographic 
variable 
that 
influences 
a 
child’s 
total 
problem 
score 
on 
the 
CBCL, 
but 
the 
influence 
was 
small. 
It 
is 
not 
clear 
why 
parental 
education 
was 
not 
correlated 
with 
BASC 
t 
scores 
in 
the 
present 
study. 


Two 
previous 
studies 
have 
compared 
behavioral 
changes 
in 
children 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSAS 
compared 
with 
a 
control 
group.5,13 
Ali 
et 
al.5 
studied 
12 
children 
with 
OSAS 
before 
and 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
and 
compared 
them 
with 
10 
controls. 
All 
children 
underwent 
behavioral 
testing 
before 
and 
after 
surgery. 
Children 
with 
OSAS 
showed 
evidence 
of 
aggression 
and 
hyperactivity 
preoperatively 
that 
was 
not 
seen 
in 
the 
control 
group. 
After 
adenotonsillectomy, 
there 
were 
no 
differences 
between 
controls 
and 
children 
with 
preoperative 
OSAS. 
Tran 
et 
al.13 
studied 
42 
children 
with 
OSAS 
documented 
by 
polysomnography 
and 
compared 
them 
using 
the 
CBCL 
with 
41 
children 
who 
did 
not 
snore 
and 
underwent 
elective 
surgery 
for 
conditions 
unrelated 
to 
sleep 
disturbance. 
There 
was 
a 
significant 
difference 
between 
the 
two 
groups 
in 
mean 
change 
after 
surgery 
for 
the 
total 
CBCL 
problem 
score, 
internalizing 
problems, 
somatic 
complaints, 
and 
thought 
problems. 


Owens 
et 
al.6 
used 
BASC 
and 
neuropsychologic 
tests 
before 
and 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
to 
study 
eight 
children 
with 
OSAS 
documented 
by 
polysomnography. 
There 
was 
little 
association 
between 
behavioral 
impairment 
and 


disease 
severity 
as 
measured 
by 
AHI. 
Similarly, 
there 
was 
no 
correlation 
between 
AHI 
and 
BASC 
t 
scores 
for 
the 
behavioral 
scales 
and 
composites 
in 
the 
present 
study. 
Indeed, 
there 
was 
a 
trend 
for 
children 
with 
less 
severe 
disease, 
who 
were 
also 
older, 
to 
have 
more 
behavioral 
problems. 
This 
suggests 
that 
there 
is 
no 
simple 
correlation 
between 
the 
physiologic 
parameters 
of 
sleep 
as 
measured 
by 
AHI 
and 
proxy 
reports 
of 
behavior 
provided 
by 
caregivers. 


The 
present 
study 
was 
limited 
to 
children 
with 
OSAS 
documented 
by 
polysomnography 
to 
evaluate 
the 
effect 
of 
surgical 
therapy 
for 
the 
most 
severe 
form 
of 
sleep 
disordered 
breathing 
on 
behavior. 
Despite 
this 
restrictive 
inclusion 
criterion 
and 
the 
need 
for 
both 
pre-and 
postoperative 
behavioral 
assessment, 
the 
study 
accumulated 
a 
relatively 
large 
population 
of 
52 
children. 
Nevertheless, 
the 
present 
study 
also 
has 
several 
limitations. 
First, 
there 
is 
no 
control 
group 
of 
children 
with 
OSAS 
to 
assess 
variability 
in 
the 
natural 
history 
of 
the 
disorder 
over 
time. 
In 
the 
absence 
of 
a 
control 
group, 
we 
cannot 
state 
categorically 
that 
adenotonsillectomy 
is 
the 
sole 
cause 
of 
improvement 
in 
the 
behavior 
of 
children 
with 
OSAS. 
However, 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
have 
a 
suitable 
control 
group 
given 
the 
need 
to 
provide 
a 
uniform 
standard 
of 
care 
for 
children 
with 
OSAS. 
Second, 
we 
cannot 
exclude 
the 
possibility 
that 
the 
observed 
improvement 
in 
behavior 
after 
surgery 
is 
caused 
to 
some 
extent 
by 
regression 
toward 
the 
mean.14 
Although 
regression 
toward 
the 
mean 
certainly 
contributes 
to 
the 
observed 
changes 
after 
surgery, 
it 
is 
highly 
unlikely 
that 
the 
dramatic 
changes 
observed 
can 
be 
explained 
solely 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
this 
phenomenon. 
Third, 
children 
in 
this 
study 
did 
not 
undergo 
postoperative 
polysomnography. 
It 
is 
possible 
that 
those 
children 
with 
clinically 
significant 
behavioral 
problems 
still 
have 
OSAS. 
Fourth, 
the 
study 
does 
not 
report 
the 
long-term 
effects 
of 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSAS 
on 
behavior 
in 
children, 
but 
a 
study 
of 
long-term 
effects 
is 
currently 
in 
progress. 
It 
is 
nonetheless 
reasonable 
to 
conclude, 
given 
the 
limitations 
of 
this 
study, 
that 
adenotonsillectomy 
has 
a 
positive 
effect 
on 
the 
behavior 
of 
children 
with 
OSAS.

CONCLUSION 


A 
high 
proportion 
of 
children 
with 
OSAS 
have 
externalizing 
behavioral 
problems 
such 
as 
hyperactivity 
or 
aggression, 
or 
internalizing 
problems 
such 
as 
anxiety, 
depression, 
and 
somatization. 
These 
problems 
improve 
significantly 
after 
adenotonsillectomy. 
The 
improvement 
is 
dramatic 
regardless 
of 
sex, 
age, 
ethnicity, 
parental 
education, 
parental 
income, 
or 
the 
relative 
severity 
of 
AHI.
