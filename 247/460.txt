Cognition, sleep and respiration in at-risk 
children treated for obstructive sleep 
apnoea 

H.E. Montgomery-Downs, V.M. Crabtree and D. Gozal 
ABSTRACT: Sleep-disordered breathing in children has been associated with cognitive 
impairment. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of tonsillectomy and 
adenoidectomy (T&A) on sleep, respiration and cognitive function in children of pre-school age 
with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) from a low-income community population. 

Altogether, 19 children attending state-funded pre-school programmes underwent overnight 
polysomnography and cognitive assessment before and following surgical treatment for OSA; 19 
matched controls were also assessed. 

Following T&A, OSA subjects’ delta sleep increased, rapid eye movement sleep decreased, and 
respiratory and arousal indices improved. There were no significant differences in OSA subjects’ 
post-operative sleep or respiratory measures compared to controls. Prior to T&A, cognitive 
scores were significantly lower in OSA subjects versus controls; following T&A, OSA subjects’ 
scores improved compared to pre-operative scores and did not differ from those of matched 
controls. 

Following tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, at-risk pre-schoolers recruited directly from the 
community showed normalised sleep and respiratory patterns and improved cognitive scores. 
These findings, in this uniquely vulnerable population, which is unlikely to seek evaluation and 
treatment for obstructive sleep apnoea, underscore the potential value of outreach screening 
programmes for sleep-disordered breathing, particularly among low-income groups of pre-school 
age.

H.E. MONTGOMERY-DOWNS ET AL. AT-RISK PRE-SCHOOLERS WITH OSA 
small clinically referred populations encompassing a broad age 
range. The goal of the present study was to examine the impact 
of T&A in young children with OSA recruited from a highly 
vulnerable at-risk community population, who had not 
previously sought medical evaluation for the potential 
presence of SDB. 

METHODS 

The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of 
the University of Louisville and Norton Healthcare (both 
Louisville, KY, USA); informed consent was obtained separately 
for participation in the parental report questionnaire and 
overnight polysomnography (PSG) elements of the study. 

Questionnaire instrument 

The information collected included the demographics of both 
parents and the child, and child behaviours, including 
frequency and loudness of snoring. Report options for snoring 
frequency included: never (never in the past 6 months), rarely 
(once a week), occasionally (twice weekly), frequently (three or 
four times a week) and almost always (more than four times a 
week). Subjects whose parents indicated that snoring occurred 
occasionally or more frequently were contacted by telephone 
and invited to participate in the second phase of the study, 
including overnight PSG and cognitive assessment. This 
instrument has previously demonstrated a high sensitivity 
when used in the same population [27]. 

Participants 

Subjects attended state-sponsored Early Jump Start pre-school 
programmes, admission to which is limited to children who 
are disadvantaged either developmentally, as determined 
through an Individual Education Plan, or financially. 
Families fulfilling the latter criterion must be financially 
eligible for the National School Lunch Program. For a family 
of four, the maximum gross annual household income for 
eligibility during the initial year of the study was US$22,945; 
the national poverty level during this period was $18,400. 
During the academic years studied, 91% of children were 
admitted to Early Jump Start on the basis of family income 
eligibility (D. Corson, Assessment, Research, and Planning, 
Jefferson County Public Schools, Louisville, KY, USA, personal 
communication). Questionnaires were sent home with all 
children enrolled in Early Jump Start pre-school classes, to be 
completed by the parent(s) and returned to school, where they 
were collected by a researcher. The subjects who were invited 
to participate further in the study were those admitted to Early 
Jump Start programmes based upon financial eligibility; 
survey participants who were developmentally disadvantaged 
or who had overt craniofacial abnormalities and whose survey 
indicated risk for SDB were referred to the affiliated sleep 
medicine clinic. 

Qualifying subjects were recruited for overnight PSG assessment 
based on parental reported questionnaires previously 
validated using the same population [27]. Subjects who were 
subsequently diagnosed with OSA and who underwent T&A 
were invited to return for follow-up assessments. 

Control subjects 

Classmates from the same socio-economically at-risk population 
whose survey results indicated that they had no history 

of snoring were matched to the OSA subjects on the basis of 
age (median of the OSA subjects’ pre-and post-operative 
assessment ages), as well as sex, ethnicity and highest level of 
maternal education achieved (table 1). These matched controls 
underwent PSG and cognitive testing on a single occasion. 
Repeat testing was not administered to the matched healthy 
controls. 

Overnight polysomnography 

Subjects were excluded from this phase of the investigation on 
the basis of incomplete questionnaires and/or contact information, 
chronic medical conditions, and genetic or overt 
craniofacial abnormalities, and/or when they had already 
sought medical evaluation for snoring. No PSG was performed 
on a night on which a child was acutely ill. 

A standard overnight multichannel PSG evaluation was 
performed in the Sleep Medicine Center at Kosair Children’s 
Hospital (Louisville, KY, USA). Children were studied for up 
to 12 h in a quiet darkened room with an ambient temperature 
of ,24°C with a parent or guardian present. Lights out was 

21:32 h (SD 19.1 min) and lights on was 06:20 h (SD 13.0 min). 
No medications were used to induce sleep. 
The following parameters were measured: chest and abdominal 
wall movement by respiratory impedance or inductance 
plethysmography; cardiac frequency by ECG; and airflow with 
a side-stream end-tidal capnograph (BCI SC-300; Redding 
Medical, Inc., Finksburg, MD, USA), which also provided 
breath-by-breath assessment of end-tidal carbon dioxide 
tension (PET,CO2) and nasal pressure, and an oral–nasal airflow 
thermistor. Arterial oxygen saturation measured by pulse 
oximetry (Sp,O2) was assessed (Nellcor N 100; Nellcor, Inc., 
Hayward, CA, USA), with a simultaneously recorded pulse 
waveform. A bilateral electro-oculogram, eight channels of

electroencephalogram, chin and anterior tibial electromyograms, 
and analogue output from a body position sensor 
(Braebon Medical Corporation, Ogdensburg, NY, USA) were 
also monitored. All measures were digitised using a commercially 
available PSG system (MedCare Diagnostics, Buffalo, 
NY, USA). Tracheal sound was monitored with a microphone 
sensor (Sleepmate; Rochester Electro-Medical, Inc., Tampa, FL, 
USA) and digital synchronised video images were collected. 

Sleep and respiratory characteristics 

Sleep architecture was assessed using standard techniques 
[28]. Central, obstructive and mixed apnoeic events were 
scored using changes measured with an oral–nasal thermistor 
and/or end-tidal carbon dioxide cannula. Obstructive apnoea 
was defined as the absence of airflow with continued chest 
wall and abdominal movement for at least two breaths [29, 30]. 
Hypopnoeas were defined as a decrease in nasal flow of o50% 
with a corresponding decrease in Sp,O2 of o4% and/or arousal 
[30]. The apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI) was defined as the 
number of apnoeas and hypopnoeas per hour of total sleep 
time (TST). For treatment referral purposes, only patients with 
an obstructive AHI of .5 events?h-1 were considered as 
candidates for T&A and referred for surgical intervention. 
Mean Sp,O2 and Sp,O2 nadir were determined. The mean and 
peak PET,CO2 were determined. Since criteria for arousal have not 
yet been developed for children [31], arousals were defined as 
recommended by the American Sleep Disorders Association 
Task Force report [32], and included respiratory-related (occurring 
immediately subsequent to an apnoea, hypopnoea or snore), 
technician-induced and spontaneous arousals. Respiratory 
arousal index was expressed as the total number of respiratory-
related arousals per hour of TST; total arousal index was 
expressed as the number of combined arousals per hour of TST. 

Cognitive assessments 

At 08:00 h on the morning following PSG and lasting ,45 min, 
developmentally appropriate cognitive assessments were 
administered. The Differential Ability Scales (DAS) [33], a 
measure of general conceptual ability (GCA), were administered. 
The pre-school version is intended for use with children 
between 2 yrs 6 months and 5 yrs 11 months of age, and has 
attractive graphics that are appealing and engaging for preschool 
children. Assessments of verbal (verbal comprehension 
and naming vocabulary) and nonverbal ability (picture 
similarities, pattern construction, copying and early number 
concepts) and block building were administered. Scores are 
reported as standard scores with a mean¡SD of 100¡15. 

The Pre-Reading Abilities subtests from the Developmental 
Neuropsychological Assessment (NEPSY) [34] were used to 
obtain measures of phonological processing, sentence comprehension 
and naming. This scale has been standardised for use 
with children aged 3–12 yrs. Scores are reported as subtest 
scaled scores with a mean¡SD of 10¡3. 

Examiners were blinded to subjects’ diagnostic status and different 
reliable examiners performed post-operative assessments. 

Statistical analyses 

Repeated-measures ANOVA (general linear model) was used 
to test for significant differences between pre-and posttreatment 
sleep, respiratory and cognitive measures, as well as 

H.E. MONTGOMERY-DOWNS ET AL. 
between OSA subjects’ pre-and post-treatment measures 
compared to matched controls. A p-value of f0.05 was 
considered significant. With 19 subjects and a difference in 
SD of 0.5 between DAS scores significant when one-tailed a was 
0.05, the statistical power of the study was 0.83. 

RESULTS 

Characteristics of sample population 

There were 1,951 respondents to the questionnaire during the 
combined 2001 and 2002 academic years, which represented a 
response rate of 32.8%. The ethnic distribution of those who 
responded to the survey (table 1) was similar to that of the 
general pre-school population during the same academic years 

(D. Corson, personal communication). 
Between October 2001 and June 2003, 273 pre-schoolers 
underwent PSG and cognitive testing. Of these, 39 were 
diagnosed as having SDB, and it was recommended by the 
medical director of the study that the family discuss referral for 
surgical treatment with the child’s primary care physician. Of 
these 39, nine families could not be contacted to determine 
treatment status despite repeated attempts, five had not 
followed treatment recommendations within 13 months and 
the remaining 25 were known to have undergone T&A. Of the 
25 who received treatment, five repeatedly did not attend 
follow-up appointments, and one refused to participate a 
second time (fig. 1). Thus 19 children underwent T&A 
(between 23 days and 8.1 months following initial PSG 
(mean¡SD 2.9¡2.1 months)) and returned for post-operative 
evaluation 2.9–6.3 months (4.0¡1.0 months) following surgery, 
completing all phases of the study, and were therefore 
available for analysis (table 1). The time from initial PSG and 
cognitive assessment to the follow-up for these OSA subjects 
was 6.9¡2.3 months.

Sleep architecture and respiratory measures 

Following T&A, the percentage of delta sleep increased and 
that of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep decreased in OSA 
subjects. Compared to controls, the pre-operative percentage of 
time awake and of delta sleep were reduced. Following T&A, 
respiratory arousal index, total arousal index, AHI and apnoea 
index were all improved. There were no significant differences 
between OSA post-operative sleep or respiratory measures and 
those of controls (table 2). 

Cognitive function 

Prior to T&A, DAS scores were significantly lower in OSA 
subjects than in controls (table 3). Following T&A, OSA DAS 
scores improved significantly compared to pre-operative 
scores and did not differ from those of the matched controls 
(table 3). Sixteen of the 19 OSA subjects improved their GCA 
scores post-operatively by one to 22 points (mean¡SEM 
6.9¡1.4) The scores of three OSA subjects decreased postoperatively 
by five (two) to nine (one) points. 

Cognitive assessments were administered to all subjects. DAS 
GCA scores were obtained for all; six pre-operative, one postoperative 
and five control administrations resulted in GCA 
being pro-rated due to a single missing subtest. Thus the data 
for individual verbal and nonverbal subtests were not 
compared for post-operative improvement analysis due to 
insufficient statistical power. 

Since this population of children was very difficult to assess 
due to their young age and developmentally at-risk status, 
NEPSY subtest results were sometimes unavailable for analysis 
due to administration difficulties. As a result, data on only 11, 
15 and 18 subjects were available for pre-/post-operative 

AT-RISK PRE-SCHOOLERS WITH OSA 

comparisons for phonological processing, sentence repetition 
and verbal fluency, respectively. NEPSY scores were not found 
to change or differ from controls on any measure except for 
verbal fluency (OSA subject scores were consistently lower 
than those of controls both before and after T&A). 

DISCUSSION 

The present at-risk population cohort of children with OSA, 
who were matched to a control group for median age between 
the initial and follow-up assessment, sex, ethnicity and 
maternal education, showed normalisation of their sleep 
and breathing patterns and improved cognitive scores following 
surgical treatment. The current sample was recruited 
directly from the community and represents a unique and 
especially vulnerable population that is ordinarily unlikely to 
seek evaluation and treatment for SDB. The current study 
underscores the potential value of outreach screening programmes 
for SDB, particularly within low-income groups of 
pre-school age. 

The OSA subjects in the present community-recruited study 
showed sleep architecture improvements post-operatively; 
namely, their latency to sleep onset decreased and the 
percentage of time spent in delta sleep increased. These 
findings are inconsistent with the only previously reported 
clinical trial reporting sleep stage percentages before and after 
T&A, in which no significant changes in overall sleep stage 
percentages were found [21]. Since a developmental trajectory 
exists for changes in sleep stage percentage distribution 
throughout the night, the present authors suspect that, 
although the number of subjects included in the present study 
was relatively low, the narrow age range included in the 
present cohort is likely to have afforded greater statistical

power, and therefore permitted identification of significant 
improvements in sleep architecture after T&A. 

An alternative possibility could include a greater propensity 
for SDB-induced disruption of sleep architecture in 
socio-economically at-risk paediatric populations, such that 
surgical correction of SDB could result in increased differences 
between pre-and post-operative sleep characteristics. 
Notwithstanding such considerations, when the post-operative 
sleep measures of OSA subjects were compared with those of 
controls matched for socio-economic factors, a complete normalisation 
of sleep measures was found, to the extent that there were 
no longer significant differences from matched controls. 

The decrease in the percentage of REM sleep following 
treatment for OSA in the present study was unexpected and 
in conflict with previously published data showing that an 
increased percentage of REM sleep is associated with 
improvements in both DAS and NEPSY scores in a slightly 
older broad community sample [8]. However, the percentage 
of REM sleep of OSA subjects did not differ from that of 
control subjects pre-or post-operatively. Although significant, 
the percentage difference between pre-and post-operative 
percentages of REM sleep in the current study translates to a 
relatively low mean difference in absolute duration of REM 
sleep (3.4 min). Regardless, this discrepancy emphasises the 
need for more intensive study of the relationship between 
sleep and neurocognitive function in young children who are 
at-risk and otherwise. 

Arousal measure indices also normalised among the at-risk 
children in the OSA group after surgery. Indeed, the total 
arousal index was almost halved post-operatively; this was 
accounted for by the almost complete abrogation of respiratory 
arousals. In contrast, the spontaneous arousal index did not 
differ post-operatively, and nor did values for either the pre-or 
post-operative measures differ from those of matched controls. 
Despite the high variability in the scoring criterion for arousal 
among different centres, the post-operative reduction in the 
respiratory arousal index in the present study was consistent 
with previous findings from available clinical trials [17, 21]. 

As expected, and previously reported [16, 17, 19–21], marked 
pre-to-post-surgical changes in respiratory indices during 
sleep were found. Both the AHI and apnoea index were 
reduced after T&A, and no longer differed from those of 
matched controls. These findings further corroborate the 
relatively high short-term efficacy of T&A in paediatric OSA 
[18]. Blood oxygenation in the absence of any respiratory 
events (baseline Sp,O2) did not differ pre-and post-operatively 

or compared to controls subjects; Sp,O2 nadir improved 
pre-to-post-surgically, was lower prior to surgery compared 
to controls and did not differ from controls following surgery. 

Concurrent with changes in sleep, arousal and respiratory 
measures, improvements in cognitive function measures were 
identified, with normalisation of complex mental functions 
after T&A compared to matched controls, as measured by the 
DAS. These findings are particularly encouraging since children 
in the current sample were already at high risk of reduced 
capacity in performing complex mental functions due to their 
low socio-economic status and environmental impoverishment. 
Both the sleep fragmentation and abnormal blood gas exchange 
that ensue from upper airway obstruction during sleep in OSA 
may induce substantial alterations in brain function and 
structure in general [35], and, more specifically, affect the pre-
frontal cortex, leading to impairments in cognitive and executive 
functional processing [36]. However, the present study suggests 
that these cognitive impairments may be reversible in very young 
children upon efficacious treatment. 

As mentioned above, there is a paucity of information on the 
reversibility of cognitive morbidity associated with paediatric 
SDB. However, animal models have revealed long-term partially 
irreversible impairments in learning, memory and executive 
function, when the intermittent hypoxia that characteristically 
accompanies SDB occurs early in development [36–40]. 
Interestingly, environmental enrichment reduces the susceptibility 
to cognitive dysfunction following exposures to intermittent 
hypoxia during sleep [41]. It could be argued that 
environmental impoverishment would enhance the deleterious 
effects of SDB. Indeed, in the present study, the mean DAS scores 
for OSA subjects’ post-operative assessments remain below the 
standard means, as do those of the matched control subjects. 
Thus the present authors submit that socio-economically 
challenged paediatric populations who do not have access to 
environments that are conducive to optimal learning and brain 
development opportunities prior to the onset of the intermittent 
hypoxia associated with OSA may be particularly susceptible to 
the deleterious effects of this disorder. 

Limitations 

There are several potential limitations to the present study. 
Attempts were made to administer components of the NEPSY. 
However, administration of a relatively large battery of tests to 
such young children is fraught with substantial difficulties, 
particularly as regards achieving the necessary sustained 
attention and motivation to successfully and reliably complete 
such tests. Thus several of the children enrolled in this study 
were unable to complete the last few items of the NEPSY,

leading to insufficient statistical power in the comparative 
analyses of these subtests. Future studies assessing similar 
populations may benefit from a school-based assessment 
approach in which testing is administered over a series of 
days rather than in a single session. 

The assessments used are designed to be stable over time, but, 
because the OSA subjects were tested twice, improvements 
due to practice effects should be considered. The DAS manual 
states that ‘‘we must keep practice effects in mind when 
interpreting the scores of a child retested within a few months 
of initial testing’’ (p. 184) and further adds that GCA has been 
shown to vary by approximately three points due to practice 
effects [33]. Since OSA subjects’ initial and follow-up assessments 
were separated by 6.9¡2.3 months (mean¡SD), this was 
sufficient to nullify this concern. 

A related limitation was that, among this at-risk population, it 
proved difficult to find families willing to participate as control 
subjects and impossible to expect them to return for a follow-
up assessment. As such, cognitive assessments were administered 
to the control subjects on a single occasion, whereas the 
OSA subjects were tested twice. Since all subjects were enrolled 
in a pre-school programme designed to provide an enriching 
academic experience, it is possible that both OSA and control 
subjects alike may have shown improvements in their 
cognitive scores over time. In view of this potential confounder, 
controls were matched to the intermediary age between 
the pre-and post-operative assessments of the OSA subjects, 
such that the groups could be compared since the beneficial 
effects of the academic programme would apply to both OSA 
and control subjects. 

It is possible that the subjects participating in the present study 
were vulnerable to first-night effects, and that these may have 
masked post-operative changes in sleep efficiency, a particular 
concern when the number of subjects is relatively low. 
However, all children in both the OSA and control groups 
were exposed to the same environmental conditions. 
Furthermore, a recent study reported that children with OSA 
did not experience first-night effects differently from other 2–6yr-
old children, and that respiratory parameters were not 
vulnerable to the presence of first-night effects [42]. 

Although all the children were sampled from an at-risk 
population, the subjects whose participation was complete, i.e. 
those who filled in and returned the screening questionnaire, 
participated in initial PSG evaluation and cognitive assessment, 
followed treatment recommendations and returned for postoperative 
evaluation, could differ from those who selected not to 
participate in one or all of the phases of the study. It is possible 
that this self-selection bias is somewhat alleviated by the intraindividual 
pre-/post-treatment comparisons, and by the fact that 
such biases are also applicable to the control population. 

It is also possible that adult illiteracy may have played a role in 
the low response rates to the survey questionnaire, that 
difficulty with transportation and inconsistent housing may 
have prevented some families from participating in the initial 
or follow-up evaluations, and that problems with health 
insurance may have prevented some families from seeking 
the recommended treatment. Nevertheless, although these 
concerns are clearly worthy of consideration, it is unlikely that 

AT-RISK PRE-SCHOOLERS WITH OSA 

they contributed to the dynamic pre-and post-operative 
changes in sleep characteristics and cognitive function in the 
OSA-afflicted children. Overcoming these limitations through 
studies using assistance-based recruitment and clinically based 
outreach programmes may confirm and further extend the 
present findings, and delineate the benefits of such early 
assessment by providing more accurate estimates regarding 
the amelioration and extent of recovery from the cognitive 
consequences associated with OSA. 

In summary, the present study has shown the difficulties 
inherent in screening for sleep-disordered breathing in a low 
socio-economic status population of children, and further 
emphasises the importance of such an approach in the context 
of the present findings, which demonstrate that sleep-disordered 
breathing is associated with substantial cognitive morbidity 
among these children. More importantly, treatment of sleep-
disordered breathing may lead to normalisation of sleep and 
reversibility of the cognitive impairment in this population. 
These encouraging results in a population that would be highly 
unlikely to seek medical care for sleep-disordered breathing 
support the institution of a school-based screening programme at 
this early age in order to prevent long-lasting morbid consequences 
of sleep-disordered breathing.
