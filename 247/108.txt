Abstract 

Objectives: Most children with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) have mild to moderate forms, for 
which neurobehavioral complications are believed to be the most important adverse outcomes. To 
improve understanding of this morbidity, its long-term response to adenotonsillectomy, and its 
relationship to polysomnographic measures, we studied a series of children before and after 
clinically-indicated adenotonsillectomy or unrelated surgical care. 

Methods: We recorded sleep and assessed behavioral, cognitive, and psychiatric morbidity in 105 
children 5.0 to 12.9 years old: 78 were scheduled for clinically-indicated adenotonsillectomy, usually 
for suspected SDB, and 27 for unrelated surgical care. One year later, we repeated all assessments 
in 100 of these children. 

Results: Adenotonsillectomy subjects, in comparison to controls, were more hyperactive on well-
validated parent rating scales (p<0.001), inattentive on cognitive testing (p=0.003), sleepy on 
Multiple Sleep Latency Tests (p=0.002), and likely to have DSM-IV-defined Attention-Deficit/ 
Hyperactivity Disorder as judged by a child psychiatrist (p=0.03). In contrast, one year later, the two 
groups showed no significant differences in the same measures. Adenotonsillectomy subjects had 
improved substantially (p=0.01) in all measures and control subjects in none. However, 
polysomnographic assessment of baseline SDB and its subsequent amelioration did not clearly 
predict either baseline neurobehavioral morbidity or improvement in any area other than sleepiness. 

Conclusions: Children scheduled for adenotonsillectomy often have mild to moderate SDB and 
significant neurobehavioral morbidity -- including hyperactivity, inattention, Attention-Deficit/ 
Hyperactivity Disorder, and excessive daytime sleepiness -- all of which tend to improve by one year 
after surgery. However, the lack of better correspondence between SDB measures and 
neurobehavioral outcomes suggests the need for better measures or improved understanding of 
underlying causal mechanisms.

INTRODUCTION 

Children with severe obstructive sleep apnea are at risk for heart failure, hypertension, and 
failure to thrive, and few clinicians doubt that the sleep disorder should be treated.1 However, 
most children with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) have more mild forms for which the main 
morbidities are believed to be behavioral disturbances and cognitive impairment.2-6 
Unfortunately, the best way to identify children with a level of SDB that raises the risk for 
these outcomes has not been well studied. The benefit of treatment for mild SDB is also not 
well defined. 

In practice, when SDB is suspected on clinical grounds and treatment by adenotonsillectomy 
(AT) is planned, less than 10% of children in North America undergo polysomnography to 
confirm the diagnosis or need for surgery.7 In contrast, the American Academy of Pediatrics 
recommends objective sleep testing before AT for SDB.8 This is because several studies have 
shown poor correlation between office-based impressions and sleep laboratory results.9 
However, standard polysomnography may miss mild forms of SDB that in cross-sectional 
studies still show associations with neurobehavioral morbidity.2,5,6,10 Few prospective 
studies have investigated the extent to which morbidity in these cases may respond to treatment,
11 none have examined long-term outcomes, and none have incorporated a full range of gold-
standard assessments for mental health, behavior, cognition, and daytime sleepiness. 

The most definitive demonstration of consequences in mild SDB would involve a double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, randomized treatment trial. This study design is not feasible at this time 
for several reasons. Families and clinicians cannot be blinded to AT and sham surgery is not 
an option. No published data have defined the time-course of neurobehavioral improvement 
after AT, and long-term randomization to a placebo arm would raise ethical concerns for 
children known to have SDB. 

We therefore chose a prospective, non-randomized follow-up study design to examine long-
term neurobehavioral outcomes and polysomnographic findings in a cohort of children already 
scheduled, for any clinical indication, to have AT. This sample offered several unique 
advantages. It allowed characterization of children undergoing one of the most common 
surgical procedures in childhood. Subjects were not recruited at a sleep disorders center, and 
for this reason were more likely to resemble the large majority of children who undergo AT 
for SDB. The sample permitted comparison of children with generally mild or moderate sleep 
apnea, likely to represent forms most often treated by otolaryngologists, to a separate group of 
children scheduled for unrelated surgical care. Finally, this sample provided a rare opportunity 
to study some subjects scheduled for AT despite having no polysomnographic evidence of 
SDB. 

We first tested the hypothesis that children who undergo AT, in comparison to other surgical 
care, experience more neurobehavioral improvement one year after surgery. We then tested 
the hypothesis that the AT children who had polysomnographic evidence of sleep apnea would 
show such improvement while the two comparison groups would not. Comprehensive, well-
validated assessments at enrollment and follow-up included nocturnal polysomnography, 
parental behavioral ratings, cognitive testing, Multiple Sleep Latency Tests, and evaluations 
by a child psychiatrist. Some interim results, mainly on polysomnographic methodology within 
this 4-year study, have been reported previously.12-16

METHODS 
Subjects 

Children between 5.0 and 12.9 years old who were scheduled for AT (n=78), for any indication, 
were identified at 8 otolaryngology practices believed to perform the large majority of ATs in 
Washtenaw County, Michigan (Figure 1). Children were excluded from this IRB-approved 
study if they 1) required a polysomnogram for clinical purposes according to their surgeons, 
2) had a history of SDB treatment, or 3) had severe medical or neurological conditions that 
would preclude behavioral, psychiatric, or polysomnographic assessments. In children younger 
than 5 years, hyperactivity (a key symptom of SDB 8) would have been difficult to distinguish 
from developmentally-appropriate behavior,17 and cognitive testing would have required 
substantial modification. After age 12, AT becomes increasingly rare and SDB may be more 
closely associated with adult symptoms. Control subjects (n=27) within the same age range 
were recruited from other surgical clinics where they were seen for concerns unrelated to risk 
for SDB. Twelve control participants were scheduled for hernia repair, and the remainder for 
no surgery. Controls were excluded for the above criteria, or for a history of large tonsils, 
frequent throat infections, adenoidectomy, or tonsillectomy. For all subjects, one parent signed 
an informed consent and the child signed an informed assent. 

Participants resembled non-participants closely in most respects (Figure 1). Among the AT 
participants, 71 (91%) were thought by their otolaryngologist to have nocturnal upper airway 
obstruction. Of the 105 subjects studied at baseline, 100 (95%) participated in the follow-up 
evaluations that took place at a mean of 13.0±1.4 months after the baseline assessments. The 
mean age at baseline was 8.4 ± 1.9 years, and 60 subjects (57%) were male. Additional baseline 
demographic data, for AT and control subjects, are provided in Table 1. At follow-up the mean 
age was 9.5±1.9 years, and 57 subjects were male. 

Baseline assessments were performed between December, 1999 and December, 2002. On the 
evening of admission to the sleep laboratory each subject and parent was interviewed by a child 
psychiatrist. The child then underwent polysomnography, and efforts were made to 
approximate usual bedtimes and rise times. On the next day, neurobehavioral assessments 
included a Multiple Sleep Latency Test of daytime sleepiness, neuropsychological testing, and 
parental behavioral ratings. Children were given a $25 gift certificate to a toy store, and parents 
a check for $100, to compensate them for their efforts. The entire assessment was repeated one 
year later. 

Polysomnography 

Baseline digital polysomnography, generally within one month prior to scheduled surgery, 
included four EEG channels (C3-A2, C4-A1, O1-A2, O2-A1 of the 10-20 international 
electrode placement system), 2 EOG channels (right and left outer canthi), chin and bilateral 
anterior tibialis EMG, and 2 EKG channels. Nasal and oral airflow were monitored with 
thermocouples, thoracic and abdominal excursion with piezoelectric strain gauges, oxygen 
saturation by finger oximetry (with viewable pulse waveform), end-tidal CO2 by pediatric nasal 
cannula, and esophageal pressure through use of a thin water-filled catheter that has negligible 
effects on sleep in children.18-20 When a volunteer research subject did not tolerate catheter 
insertion, or esophageal pressure monitoring was maintained for < 2 hours, the data were 
considered missing. This occurred in about 1/3 of the children.12 Nasal pressure was not used 
because of high failure rates in children,21,22 insufficient space at the nares after CO2 cannula 
and thermocouples were applied, and availability of esophageal pressure monitoring 
considered to be the gold-standard in assessment of respiratory effort.23

All records were scored by one experienced, registered sleep technologist, masked to all 
information on clinical, demographic, and surgical status. To avoid any effect of scoring drift 
over time, scoring took place in batches of 10 records that included pre- and post-operative 
studies from 5 subjects. Sleep stage scoring followed standard protocols.24 Obstructive apneas 
were scored when airflow was absent for at least 2 breath cycles. Hypopneas were scored when 
at least 2 breath cycles of diminished airflow, chest movement, or abdominal movement were 
followed by an arousal, an awakening, or a 4% or greater oxygen desaturation. Central apneas 
not associated with a sigh or movement were scored when they were =20 seconds long, or else 
=10 seconds long but associated with bradycardia or =4% oxygen desaturation.25 Respiratory 
effort-related arousals 23 were scored when esophageal pressures gradually became more 
negative by at least 5 cm of water over a period of at least 5 respiratory cycles; when the 
sequence terminated in an arousal;26 and when no simultaneous apnea or hypopnea could be 
scored. The respiratory disturbance index was defined as the number of obstructive, mixed, or 
central apneas; hypopneas; and respiratory event-related arousals per hour of sleep. Obstructive 
sleep apnea was considered present when the obstructive apnea index (number per hour of 
sleep) was 1 or more 27 (operationalized as =0.50 to ensure that subjects not so identified had 
no significant apnea). Although specific cut-points have not been widely-accepted, pediatric 
obstructive sleep apnea can be considered mild when the apnea index is 1 – 4, moderate when 
this index is 5 – 10, and severe when this index is > 10.28 

Neurobehavioral Assessment 

Behavior: Parents completed two well-validated, similar but complementary behavioral rating 
instruments, the Conners' Parent Rating Scales-Revised (L) 29 and the Child Symptom 
Inventory-4: Parent Checklist.30 A behavioral hyperactivity index was constructed from the 
average of T-scores (mean of 50, standard deviation of 10) for inattention and hyperactivity 
generated by the two instruments. For each component instrument, significant problematic 
behavior is often identified by T-scores that are 1 to 2 standard deviations or more above the 
mean. 

The Conners' instrument contains 80 items and is often used when comprehensive, DSM-IVconsistent 
data are required. Norms are based on a sample of more than 8000 male and female 
children and adolescents aged 3 to 17 years, with good geographic and ethnic diversity. The 
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Index T-score was used to construct the behavioral 
hyperactivity index. The Child's Symptom Inventory-4 is a 108-item behavior rating instrument 
that screens for a variety of DSMIV-based childhood emotional and behavioral disorders in 
male and female children aged 5-12 years in kindergarten through 6th grade. The T-score for 
the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder subtest of the CSI-4 was used to construct the 
behavioral hyperactivity index. 

Cognition: A cognitive attention index was derived from the average of standard scores (mean 
= 100, s.d. = 15) from each of two well-validated measures of attention. The first, the Integrated 
Visual and Auditory Continuous Performance Test, assesses sustained attention, or vigilance, 
and is administered on a personal computer.31,32 The child sees “1” or “2” on the screen and 
clicks a mouse button only when “1” appears. The main testing period consists of 500 trials, 

1.5 seconds each, in which the visual or auditory stimuli are presented briefly in a pseudorandom 
pattern. The number of omissions, as reflected by the Full Scale Attention Quotient, 
was the first component of the cognitive attention index. 
The Attention/Concentration Subscale from the Children's Memory Scale 33 generated the 
second component of the cognitive attention index. This subscale is made up of two subtests 
—Numbers and Sequences. Numbers measures the ability to repeat, in a forward or backward 
manner, random digit sequences of graduated length. Sequences measures the ability to 
mentally manipulate and sequence verbal information as quickly as possible: the examinee is

asked to perform such tasks as saying the days of the week backward and counting by 4's. 
Standard scores from the CMS Numbers and Sequences subtests were converted into a standard 
score for the CMS Attention/Concentration Scale. This score was then averaged with the Full 
Scale Attention Quotient standard score to obtain an overall cognitive attention index. 

Psychiatric Diagnosis: The diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder based on 
DSM-IV criteria was determined by a board-certified child psychiatrist, masked to any sleep 
study results but not to surgical status. The psychiatrist administered the well-validated, 
computerized Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children – Parent Interview, present-state 
version,34 and also interviewed the parent and child independently to verify results. 

Sleepiness: The Multiple Sleep Latency Test 35 included 4 or 5 nap attempts at two-hour 
intervals. The fifth nap was performed when one preceding nap showed rapid eye movement 
(REM) sleep. For each nap, sleep onset was scored at the first epoch of stage 1 sleep. If no 
sleep occurred, the nap opportunity terminated at 20 minutes, and this value was used in 
calculation of a mean sleep latency. The Multiple Sleep Latency Test is the most well-validated 
and widely-used objective assessment of daytime sleepiness in adults and children. The 
Multiple Sleep Latency Test is not often administered to children younger than 7 years,36 but 
is sensitive to SDB-related sleepiness in children as young as 3 years.37 

Analysis 

Data were entered into a database by a professional company that used double entry for 
verification. The primary outcome was the behavioral hyperactivity index and the primary 
explanatory variable was subject group (adenotonsillectomy vs. control). Secondary analyses 
divided the adenotonsillectomy group into those with and without obstructive sleep apnea on 
polysomnography, and examined group differences in additional outcome variables: apnea/ 
hypopnea index, cognitive attention index, mean sleep latency, and diagnosis of AttentionDeficit/
Hyperactivity Disorder. 

A chi-square test or Fisher's Exact Test was used to test for group differences in frequency of 
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder; McNemar's Test was used to test for changes over 
time. For each of the 4 continuous outcome variables, a single repeated measures model was 
implemented using PROC MIXED in SAS®, version 8.02 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Each 
analysis produced main effect tests for subject group and time (baseline vs. one-year follow-
up) and a test for the group by time interaction. The models also allowed assessment of 
differences between groups at both time points and the change over time in each group. Group 
differences failed to show statistical significance for several potential covariates (such as 
gender, race, body mass index, stimulant use, or socioeconomic group, as indicated in Table 
1). The groups differed in mean age by one year, but age did not predict changes in outcomes 
at follow-up. Histograms of residuals suggested that assumptions of normality were valid, 
except for the apnea/hypopnea index, which required a natural logarithmic transformation (log 
[x+1]). Finally, to explore whether additional, continuous sleep measures might predict 
neurobehavioral measures more effectively, with or without adjustment for age, each 
neurobehavioral measure was regressed in linear or logistic models on each polysomnographic 
measure individually. 

RESULTS 
Polysomnography at Baseline and Follow-Up 

Polysomnographic SDB measures are summarized in Table 2. The baseline obstructive apnea 
index ranged from 0.0 to 38.2, and the apnea/hypopnea index from 0.0 to 74.4. Forty (51%) 
of the 78 AT subjects, in comparison to only 1 (4%) of the 27 control subjects, had obstructive

sleep apnea (X2=19.1, p<0.001). In most cases sleep apnea was in the mild to moderate range 
of severity. 

At follow-up, obstructive sleep apnea was found in only 9 (12%) of 77 AT children and in 3 
(13%) of 23 controls (Fisher's exact test, p=1.00). Average SDB measures also improved 
considerably, eliminating group differences at one year (Table 2). However, among 39 AT 
subjects with obstructive sleep apnea at baseline, 8 (21%) still had it at follow-up; in 
comparison, among 38 AT subjects without obstructive sleep apnea at baseline, only 1 (3%) 
had it at follow-up (X2=6.0, p=0.01). 

Adenotonsillectomy vs. Control Subjects 

Least-squares mean values from the four generalized linear mixed models of apnea/hypopnea 
index, behavioral hyperactivity index, cognitive attention index, and mean sleep latency are 
shown in Figure 2. Table 3 shows the significance levels for the relevant hypotheses tests 
derived from these models. The AT and control groups showed robust differences in the apnea/ 
hypopnea index, behavioral hyperactivity index, cognitive attention index, and mean sleep 
latency at baseline. In contrast, none of these differences reached significance at one year 
(though the behavioral hyperactivity index showed a trend). Each outcome measure changed 
significantly with time for the AT subjects, whereas none changed significantly for the control 
subjects. The time by group interaction for mean sleep latency and apnea/hypopnea index 
shows that their changes over time differed significantly between the AT group and control 
groups, as illustrated by the non-parallel slopes in Figure 2. 

Adenotonsillectomy with Obstructive Sleep Apnea, Adenotonsillectomy without Obstructive 
Sleep Apnea, and Control Subjects 

The results for the three-group analyses are illustrated in Figure 3 and significance levels are 
detailed in Table 4. Again, the groups differed significantly in each outcome at baseline but in 
no outcome at follow-up. The apnea/hypopnea index and mean sleep latency improved 
significantly with time in the AT subjects with obstructive sleep apnea but not in AT subjects 
without obstructive sleep apnea. In contrast, both the behavioral hyperactivity index and the 
cognitive attention index improved with time as much or more among AT subjects without 
sleep apnea as they did among AT subjects with sleep apnea. Time by group interactions 
showed significant group differences in changes over time only for the apnea/hypopnea index 
and mean sleep latency. 

Diagnosis of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder 

Twenty-two (28%) of the AT subjects had Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder at 
baseline, in comparison to only 2 (7%) of the controls (X2=4.9, p=0.03). Among the 22 AT 
subjects, 9 met criteria for the inattentive subtype of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, 
2 for the hyperactive subtype, and 11 for the combined subtype. Eleven (50%) of the 22 no 
longer qualified for the diagnosis one year later. To demonstrate the extent to which this change 
exceeded instability in the diagnosis over time in the opposite direction and without AT, the 
22 subjects were combined with 21 controls who had no Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity 
Disorder at baseline, among whom only 2 (10%) newly qualified for the diagnosis one year 
later (McNemar's test, p=0.01). The frequency of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder 
was not significantly different between all AT and all control subjects after surgery (21% vs. 
9%, Fisher's Exact Test, p=0.23). Both at baseline and follow-up, the frequency of this 
diagnosis was nearly identical among those AT subjects with and without baseline sleep apnea 
(28% vs. 29% at baseline, and 23% vs. 18% at follow-up, p>0.6 for each).

Additional Polysomnographic Measures and Outcomes 

At baseline, no behavioral, cognitive, or psychiatric outcome measure was associated with any 
Table 2 polysomnographic variable in regression models (all p>0.05). In contrast, increased 
sleepiness was associated with higher levels of each SDB measure except for the arousal index 
(Table 5). Model results for the 4 neurobehavioral variables were essentially no different after 
adjustment for age. No neurobehavioral morbidity showed a newly-significant association with 
a polysomnographic variable when the analyses were confined to the 78 AT subjects, or to the 
40 AT subjects with obstructive sleep apnea (mean obstructive apnea index = 5.6±8.0, mean 
apnea/hypopnea index = 13.1±15.3). 

Similarly, one-year change scores for behavioral, cognitive, and psychiatric outcomes showed 
no significant associations with changes in SDB measures. In contrast, improvement in the 
mean sleep latency was predicted by improvement in every SDB measure except for end-tidal 
CO2 (Table 6). Adjustment of each model for age did not change the findings, except that 
diminished apnea/hypopnea index was associated with improved attention (p=0.04). 
Restriction of the analyses to AT subjects did not make any association between 
neurobehavioral and sleep changes newly significant; restriction to AT subjects with baseline 
obstructive sleep apnea again revealed only a marginally-significant association between 
diminished apnea/hypopnea index and improved attention (p=0.04). 

DISCUSSION 

This prospective study of 105 children who had AT or unrelated surgical care shows that 
prominent baseline group differences in hyperactive behavior, attention deficit, sleepiness, and 
frequency of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder became difficult to identify one year 
after surgery. These improvements are remarkable because hyperactivity and inattention 
generally are expected to be chronic features in affected school-aged children.17 After AT, 
parental ratings for hyperactivity and cognitive scores for inattention declined by nearly 0.5 
standard deviations; half of the children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder no 
longer qualified for the diagnosis; and an objective measure of sleepiness improved. 
Surprisingly, common laboratory measures of SDB severity did not show associations with 
baseline neurobehavioral morbidity other than sleepiness, and one-year changes in laboratory 
measures generally did not predict neurobehavioral outcomes except for reduced sleepiness. 
Findings from this relatively comprehensive, long-term study of neurobehavioral outcomes 
after treatment of mild to moderate childhood SDB have several important implications for 
our understanding of pediatric SDB and for clinical practice. 

Clear improvement in our subjects after AT provides new suggestive evidence for a cause-andeffect 
relationship between SDB – at least as identified in the office by otolaryngologists -and 
several adverse behavioral, cognitive, and mental health outcomes. However, our non-
randomized study design cannot prove cause and effect. Moreover, the poor correspondence 
between SDB measures and neurobehavioral outcomes, at baseline and follow-up, seems to 
run directly counter to expectations if SDB causes these morbidities. The one exception, for 
daytime sleepiness, is surprising because most pediatric sleep specialists have considered 
hyperactivity and inattention to be more prominent than overt sleepiness in childhood SDB.
38 However, the extent of improvement in sleepiness, by only one minute on average in the 
Multiple Sleep Latency Test, may have limited clinical significance. 

The lack of significant associations between SDB measures and either neurobehavioral 
morbidity or treatment outcomes could simply reflect inadequate sample size. However, to our 
knowledge this prospective series of children studied with detailed sleep and behavioral 
measures represents the largest to date. The sample size proved more than sufficient to identify 
statistically-robust post-operative changes in both explanatory and outcome variables.

Therefore, we believe that lack of better correspondence between these variables may reflect 
limitations of standard SDB measures in assessment of the highly-prevalent, mild SDB that is 
commonly treated by otolaryngologists. 

Support for this suspicion also derives from a growing number of other investigations. At least 
3 cross-sectional studies found that hyperactive behavior or cognitive deficits correlated well 
with SDB symptoms such as snoring, but not polysomnographic measures of SDB severity.
5,39,40 Esophageal pressure monitoring, to assess the excessive respiratory effort believed to 
disturb sleep in SDB,23,41 was not monitored in these studies and may have provided unique 
information on subtle SDB in children.42 However, successful use of this method in most of 
our subjects to refine a respiratory disturbance index did not improve the outcome-based 
effectiveness of diagnostic polysomnography. This was probably because the esophageal 
pressure monitoring did not prove to identify many discrete events beyond those already 
captured by sensitive, two-breath criteria now commonly used for pediatric hypopneas. 

Several limitations to our study and its conclusions merit discussion. This study did not test 
the overall utility of polysomnography, as non-neurobehavioral outcomes were not studied, 
and neither were several other common reasons for pre-operative testing, such as assessment 
of operative risk.43 Families who refused to participate clearly outnumbered participants, as 
in most clinical research. Although data available to compare the two groups were largely 
reassuring, an influence of referral bias on baseline findings in particular cannot be excluded. 
The sleep and cognitive testing we used are considered objective, but parents and psychiatrists 
who assessed the children could not be masked to surgical status. Recruitment of control 
subjects for this study from non-otolaryngology clinics provided a group comparable in terms 
of exposure to the medical system, but not levels of baseline hyperactivity. Regression to the 
mean potentially could explain some of the neurobehavioral improvement in the AT group. 
However, recruitment and observation of children with neurobehavioral problems for one year 
without treatment was not a realistic option. Moreover, the excess neurobehavioral problems 
identified in our AT subjects did not arise from specific efforts to recruit for these traits. Data 
that compared participants to non-participants at baseline suggested only a limited difference 
in the frequency of parental concern for behavioral problems. 

In conclusion, our data on subjects identified within otolarygnologists' practices help to 
characterize the cognitive and behavioral burden carried by many of their patients and relieved 
one year after AT. The findings suggest that SDB, though usually in the mild-to-moderate 
range, nonetheless carries risk for substantial, reversible neurobehavioral morbidity. The 
polysomnographic data, along with previous reports, increasingly suggest that children with 
“primary snoring” – in the absence of frequent apneic events, arousals, or gas exchange 
abnormalities – may still be at risk for significant neurobehavioral consequences. Published 
guidelines that recommend objective testing before AT, to distinguish SDB from primary 
snoring,8 may deserve reevaluation as new outcome data emerge on children with negative 
polysomnograms.10 

Finally, the lack of better outcome-based performance of standard polysomnographic measures 
in mild pediatric SDB is a particular clinical concern: these are the children, rather than those 
with severe SDB, for whom effective objective measures could have the most impact. Our data 
must raise the possibility that some correlate of SDB, rather than SDB itself, causes the 
morbidity we studied.44 However, we also speculate that new SDB measures could be 
developed with better ability to predict neurobehavioral outcomes. Approaches with potential 
promise, for example, could involve characterization of the cyclic alternating pattern in 
children,45 respiratory and non-respiratory arousals,46 or subtle electroencephalographic

The 105 subjects who participated in this study were identified as shown. Although a minority 
of non-participating families refused any discussion with investigators about the study and 
generated no basis for comparison to participants, some data were collected with permission 
by phone from many families who expressed willingness to hear about the study but later 
declined to participate. Comparisons between the 78 AT subjects whose data we report and 
those who did not participate (n = 136 to 173 whose data were available, depending on the 
variable in question), and separately between the 27 controls who participated and those who 
did not (n = 107 to 362), failed to reveal any statistically significant differences in gender, 
racial distribution, socioeconomic status (high = groups 3, 4, or 5 vs. low = groups 1 or 2), 
history of chronic tonsillitis, snoring frequency, or witnessed apneas. Participants were slightly 
older than non-participants in both the AT and control groups, by 0.5 years (p = 0.07) and 1.2 
years (p = 0.01) respectively. Parents of 56% of the AT participants had behavioral concerns 
about their children, whereas only 40% of the non-participant AT parents had such concerns 
(p = 0.04). In contrast, identical percentages of control participants and non-participants (15% 
for each) had such concerns (p = 1.00).

Estimated least-squares means and their standard errors, obtained from repeated measures 
analysis of variance models, are shown for four study outcomes: rates of apneas and hypopneas 
(transformed), hyperactivity, attention, and sleepiness. Data are plotted for adenotonsillectomy 
(.) and control subjects (¦). Stars indicate significant (p<0.05) differences at baseline or one 
year, or significant time by group interaction (see Table 3).
