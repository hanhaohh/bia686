Background—We 
assessed 
whether 
insufficient 
sleep 
is 
associated 
with 
prehypertension 
in 
healthy 
adolescents. 


Methods 
and 
Results—We 
undertook 
a 
cross-sectional 
analysis 
of 
238 
adolescents, 
all 
without 
sleep 
apnea 
or 
severe 
comorbidities. 
Participants 
underwent 
multiple-day 
wrist 
actigraphy 
at 
home 
to 
provide 
objective 
estimates 
of 
sleep 
patterns. 
In 
a 
clinical 
research 
facility, 
overnight 
polysomnography, 
anthropometry, 
and 
9 
blood 
pressure 
measurements 
over 
2 
days 
were 
made. 
Exposures 
were 
actigraphy-defined 
low 
weekday 
sleep 
efficiency, 
an 
objective 
measure 
of 
sleep 
quality 
(low 
sleep 
efficiency 
85%), 
and 
short 
sleep 
duration 
(6.5 
hours). 
The 
main 
outcome 
was 
prehypertension 
(90th 
percentile 
for 
age, 
sex, 
and 
height), 
with 
systolic 
and 
diastolic 
blood 
pressures 
as 
continuous 
measures 
as 
secondary 
outcomes. 
Prehypertension, 
low 
sleep 
efficiency, 
and 
short 
sleep 
duration 
occurred 
in 
14%, 
26%, 
and 
11% 
of 
the 
sample, 
respectively. 
In 
unadjusted 
analyses, 
the 
odds 
of 
prehypertension 
increased 
4.5-fold 
(95% 
CI, 
2.1 
to 
9.7) 
in 
adolescents 
with 
low 
sleep 
efficiency 
and 
2.8-fold 
(95% 
CI, 
1.1 
to 
7.3) 
in 
those 
with 
short 
sleep. 
In 
analyses 
adjusted 
for 
sex, 
body 
mass 
index 
percentile, 
and 
socioeconomic 
status, 
the 
odds 
of 
prehypertension 
increased 
3.5-fold 
(95% 
CI, 
1.5. 
8.0) 
for 
low 
sleep 
efficiency 
and 
2.5-fold 
(95% 
CI, 
0.9 
to 
6.9) 
for 
short 
sleep. 
Adjusted 
analyses 
showed 
that 
adolescents 
with 
low 
sleep 
efficiency 
had 
on 
average 
a 
4.01.2-mm 
Hg 
higher 
systolic 
blood 
pressure 
than 
other 
children 
(P0.01). 


Conclusions—Poor 
sleep 
quality 
is 
associated 
with 
prehypertension 
in 
healthy 
adolescents. 
Associations 
are 
not 
explained 
by 
socioeconomic 
status, 
obesity, 
sleep 
apnea, 
or 
known 
comorbidities, 
suggesting 
that 
inadequate 
sleep 
quality 
is 
associated 
with 
elevated 
blood 
pressure.

ypertension 
is 
an 
increasingly 
prevalent 
health 
problem 
in 
adults 
and 
adolescents 
alike. 
Between 
1988 
and 
1999, 
prehypertension 
(ie, 
a 
blood 
pressure 
[BP] 
90th 
percentile 
for 
height, 
age, 
and 
sex) 
and 
hypertension 
were 
estimated 
to 
increase 
in 
children 
by 
2.3% 
and 
1%, 
respectively.1 
Childhood 
hypertension 
is 
associated 
with 
hypertension 
in 
adulthood, 
a 
risk 
factor 
for 
cardiovascular 
disease 
incidence 
and 
death.2–5 
It 
also 
is 
associated 
with 
end-organ 
damage, 
notably 
left 
ventricular 
hypertrophy, 
in 
both 
children 
and 
adults.6,7 


Clinical 
Perspective 
p 
1040 


Several 
studies 
have 
implicated 
insufficient 
sleep 
as 
a 
risk 
factor 
for 
hypertension 
in 
adults.8–12 
Although 
the 
cause 
is 
unclear, 
experimental 
studies 
indicate 
that 
shorter 
sleep 
results 
in 
metabolic 
and 
endocrine 
dysfunction, 
which 
may 
contribute 
to 
cardiovascular 
disease.13–17 
Studies 
in 
both 
adult 
and 
pediatric 
populations 
also 
have 
reported 
associations 
of 
shorter 
sleep 
duration 
with 
obesity 
and 
impaired 
glucose 
tolerance.14,18,19 
These 
findings 
have 
a 
potentially 
large 
public 
impact 
given 
the 
frequency 
of 
sleep 
curtailment.20 


Few 
studies 
have 
addressed 
the 
relationship 
between 
sleep 
and 
hypertension 
in 
children. 
A 
higher 
level 
of 
diastolic 
but 
not 
systolic 
BP 
was 
reported 
in 
children 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 


compared 
with 
primary 
snorers.21 
The 
Tucson’s 
Children’s 
Assessment 
of 
Sleep 
Apnea 
Study 
found 
that 
elevations 
in 
systolic 
and 
diastolic 
BPs 
were 
independently 
associated 
with 
sleep 
efficiency, 
respiratory 
disturbance 
index 
(a 
measure 
of 
sleep 
apnea), 
and 
obesity 
in 
230 
children 
6 
to 
11 
years 
of 
age.22 
To 
the 
best 
of 
our 
knowledge, 
no 
studies 
have 
examined 
the 
association 
between 
insufficient 
sleep 
and 
BP 
in 
adolescents 
free 
of 
sleep 
apnea. 
In 
this 
report, 
we 
examine 
the 
relationship 
between 
prehypertension 
and 
systolic 
and 
diastolic 
BP 
levels 
and 
objective 
measures 
of 
sleep 
quality 
and 
duration 
in 
a 
community-based 
cohort 
of 
adolescents. 
First, 
we 
hypothesize 
that 
adolescents 
with 
poor 
sleep 
quality 
or 
short 
sleep 
duration 
will 
be 
at 
increased 
odds 
of 
prehypertension. 
Second, 
we 
posit 
that 
adolescents 
with 
short 
sleep 
duration 
or 
poor 
sleep 
quality 
will 
have 
higher 
systolic 
and 
diastolic 
BP 
readings 
on 
average 
compared 
with 
adolescents 
with 
better-quality 
sleep. 
We 
excluded 
adolescents 
with 
clinically 
significant 
levels 
of 
sleep 
apnea 
to 
minimize 
the 
influence 
of 
this 
exposure 
on 
BP 
and 
sleep 
duration 
measurement.

238 
adolescents 
free 
of 
severe 
illnesses 
who 
participated 
in 
an 
examination 
performed 
between 
2002 
and 
2006 
aimed 
at 
participants 
13 
to 
16 
years 
of 
age. 
Details 
of 
the 
study 
population 
have 
been 
reported 
elsewhere23,24 
and 
are 
reviewed 
in 
the 
online 
Data 
Supplement. 


Study 
Protocol 


Adolescents 
underwent 
5-to 
7-day 
wrist 
actigraphy 
and 
completed 
a 
daily 
sleep 
log 
at 
home 
during 
the 
week 
before 
a 
clinical 
research 
center 
examination 
and 
when 
free 
of 
acute 
illness. 
After 
this 
period 
of 
in-home 
monitoring, 
participants 
were 
studied 
in 
a 
dedicated 
clinical 
research 
center 
where 
overnight 
polysomnography 
and 
physiological 
and 
anthropometric 
assessments 
were 
performed 
using 
a 
standardized 
protocol.23,25 
Examinations 
at 
the 
research 
center 
began 
at 
approximately 
5 
PM 
and 
ended 
the 
following 
day 
at 
11 
AM. 
Informed 
consent 
was 
obtained 
from 
the 
child’s 
legal 
guardian, 
and 
written 
assent 
was 
obtained 
from 
the 
child. 
The 
study 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
governing 
institutional 
review 
board. 


Measurements 


Actigraphy 


Sleep-wake 
estimation 
was 
made 
with 
wrist 
actigraphy 
(Octagonal 
Sleep 
Watch 
2.01, 
Ambulatory 
Monitoring 
Inc, 
Ardsley, 
NY) 
analyzed 
with 
the 
Action-W 
software 
and 
the 
time-above-threshold 
algorithm.24 
Using 
weekday 
data 
(minimum, 
3 
days), 
we 
calculated 
mean 
sleep 
duration 
and 
mean 
sleep 
efficiency, 
an 
objective 
measure 
of 
sleep 
continuity 
and 
quality 
defined 
as 
the 
percentage 
of 
time 
in 
bed 
estimated 
to 
be 
asleep 
(ie, 
total 
time 
estimated 
to 
be 
asleep 
divided 
by 
the 
total 
time 
in 
bed 
for 
the 
major 
sleep 
period 
times 
100). 
Adolescents 
with 
a 
sleep 
efficiency 
85% 
were 
considered 
to 
have 
low 
sleep 
efficiency. 
Given 
the 
lack 
of 
data 
on 
cutoffs 
for 
defining 
short 
sleep 
duration 
in 
this 
age, 
we 
used 
the 
lowest 
decile 
of 
mean 
sleep 
duration 
on 
weekdays 
to 
define 
short 
sleep 
duration, 
which 
approximated 
6.5 
hours. 


Blood 
Pressure 


Three 
BP 
readings 
were 
obtained 
at 
each 
of 
3 
times 
(9 
PM 
[supine] 
the 
night 
of 
the 
polysomnography 
and 
8 
AM 
[supine] 
and 
9:30 
AM 
[sitting] 
the 
following 
morning) 
following 
published 
guidelines.23 
After 
a 
10-minute 
rest 
period, 
BP 
was 
obtained 
by 
trained 
nurses 
using 
a 
calibrated 
sphygmomanometer. 
The 
mean 
systolic 
and 
diastolic 
BP 
values 
used 
in 
primary 
analyses 
were 
based 
on 
the 
average 
of 
all 
9 
measurements. 
Prehypertension 
was 
identified 
if 
the 
systolic 
and/or 
diastolic 
BP 
was 
90th 
percentile 
for 
age, 
sex, 
and 
height.4 
Hypertension 
was 
defined 
as 
systolic 
or 
diastolic 
BP 
95th 
percentile. 
One 
adolescent 
using 
antihypertensive 
medication 
was 
classified 
as 
having 
hypertension. 


Other 
Measurements 


A 
rigid 
stadiometer 
was 
used 
to 
measure 
height, 
and 
a 
calibrated 
digital 
scale 
was 
used 
to 
measure 
weight. 
Body 
mass 
index 
(BMI) 
was 
calculated 
by 
dividing 
the 
weight 
in 
kilograms 
by 
height 
in 
meters 
squared 
and 
converted 
into 
age-and 
sex-adjusted 
percentiles 
(http://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/). 
Overweight 
was 
defined 
as 
BMI 
95th 
percentile. 
Adolescents 
who 
were 
reported 
to 
snore 
loudly 
at 
least 
1 
to 
2 
times 
per 
week 
during 
the 
past 
month 
were 
categorized 
as 
snorers. 
The 
apnea– 
hypopnea 
index 
was 
defined 
as 
all 
obstructive 
apneas 
and 
hypopneas 
with 
a 
3% 
desaturation 
per 
sleep 
hour 
from 
the 
polysomnogram. 
Socioeconomic 
status 
(SES) 
measures 
included 
parent 
report 
of 
educational 
level 
and 
family 
income. 
Additionally, 
the 
census 
tract 
of 
the 
child’s 
residence 
when 
initially 
enrolled 
in 
the 
study 
was 
linked 
to 
the 
corresponding 
2000 
US 
Census 
Bureau 
database, 
and 
median 
income 
of 
the 
census 
tract 
was 
ascertained 
(http://wagda.lib.washington.edu/data/type/census/). 
A 
composite 
SES 
z 
score 
was 
created 
by 
averaging 
the 
sample 
z 
scores 
for 
these 
3 
measures. 
Tanner 
staging 
was 
performed 
by 
a 
physician 
to 
determine 
pubertal 
status.26,27 
Preterm 
status 
was 
ascertained 
from 
birth 
records 
and 
defined 
as 
a 
gestational 
age 
37 
weeks. 
Attention 
deficit 
hyperactivity 
disorder 
(ADHD) 
was 
defined 
as 
parent-reported 
doctor’s 
diagnosis 
of 
ADHD 
and 
either 
currently 
present 
condition 
or 
medication/stimulant 
use 
for 
ADHD 
during 
the 
past 
year. 
Using 
a 
standardized 
questionnaire, 
adolescents 
reported 


the 
frequency 
with 
which 
they 
consumed 
caffeine 
after 
6 
PM 
during 
the 
past 
month; 
those 
reporting 
“frequently” 
or 
“always” 
consuming 
caffeine 
were 
coded 
as 
consuming 
caffeine 
in 
the 
evening. 


Statistical 
Analysis 


Between-group 
differences 
for 
the 
binary 
outcome, 
prehypertension, 
were 
assessed 
with 
the 
Pearson 
2 
test 
for 
categorical 
variables, 
the 
2-sample 
t 
test 
for 
normally 
distributed 
variables, 
and 
the 
Wilcoxon 
rank-sum 
test 
for 
non–normally 
distributed 
measures. 
To 
assess 
confounding, 
associations 
between 
the 
primary 
exposures, 
low 
sleep 
efficiency 
(85%) 
and 
short 
sleep 
duration 
(6.5 
hours), 
and 
sociodemographic 
characteristics 
also 
were 
examined. 
Spearman 
and 
Pearson 
correlations 
assessed 
the 
strength 
of 
the 
linear 
relationship 
between 
sleep 
characteristics 
obtained 
from 
polysomnography 
and 
actigraphy. 
Logistic 
regression 
analyses 
were 
used 
to 
examine 
whether 
adolescents 
with 
short 
sleep 
duration 
or 
low 
sleep 
efficiency 
were 
at 
increased 
odds 
of 
prehypertension. 
Given 
the 
relatively 
small 
number 
of 
adolescents 
with 
prehypertension, 
covariate 
adjustment 
was 
limited 
to 
the 
SES 
z 
score 
and 
the 
2 
variables 
most 
strongly 
associated 
with 
prehypertension: 
sex 
and 
BMI 
percentile. 
Multiple 
linear 
regression, 
adjusted 
for 
age, 
sex, 
race, 
preterm 
status, 
BMI 
percentile, 
and 
SES 
z 
score, 
was 
used 
to 
examine 
the 
linear 
associations 
between 
sleep 
duration 
or 
sleep 
efficiency 
with 
continuously 
measured 
systolic 
and 
diastolic 
BP 
levels. 
Additional 
analyses 
included 
low 
sleep 
efficiency 
from 
the 
polysomnography 
as 
the 
exposure. 
Residual 
confounding 
by 
snoring 
or 
the 
apnea– 
hypopnea 
index 
also 
was 
assessed 
by 
including 
these 
measures 
as 
covariates 
in 
the 
adjusted 
analyses.

of 
age. 
As 
designed, 
the 
sample 
had 
an 
50% 
representation 
of 
boys, 
blacks, 
and 
children 
born 
prematurely. 
One 
fifth 
of 
the 
sample 
was 
overweight. 
Approximately 
one-fourth 
reported 
their 
household 
income 
as 
less 
than 
$20 
000 
per 
year. 
Sixty-one 
adolescents 
(26%) 
had 
low 
sleep 
efficiency. 
Average 
weekday 
sleep 
duration 
was 
7.71 
hours, 
and 
11% 
of 
the 
sample 
slept 
6.5 
hours. 


Sample 
characteristics 
stratified 
by 
prehypertension 
also 
are 
shown 
in 
Table 
1. 
Overall, 
33 
children 
(14%) 
met 
the 
criteria 
for 
prehypertension, 
including 
19 
who 
had 
prehypertension 
and 
14 
who 
were 
hypertensive. 
Compared 
with 
normotensive 
adolescents, 
those 
with 
prehypertension 
tended 
to 
more 
often 
be 
male, 
tended 
to 
have 
a 
higher 
BMI, 
and 
were 
more 
frequently 
from 
neighborhoods 
with 
a 
low 
median 
income 
(P0.05 
to 
0.10). 
Both 
low 
sleep 
efficiency 
(P0.0001) 
and 
short 
sleep 
duration 
(P0.06) 
were 
2-fold 
more 
prevalent 
in 
those 
with 
prehypertension 
compared 
with 
normotensive 
adolescents. 


The 
distribution 
of 
various 
BP 
measures 
is 
further 
detailed 
in 
Table 
2. 
Using 
the 
mean 
of 
9 
BP 
readings, 
we 
classified 


11% 
of 
the 
sample 
as 
having 
elevated 
systolic 
BP 
and 
5% 
as 
having 
elevated 
diastolic 
BP. 
All 
measures 
of 
systolic 
BP 
were 
significantly 
higher 
among 
the 
adolescents 
with 
low 
sleep 
efficiency 
compared 
with 
those 
with 
higher 
sleep 
efficiency. 
Adolescents 
with 
low 
sleep 
efficiency 
also 
had 
a 
higher 
prevalence 
of 
elevated 
diastolic 
BP 
and 
had 
higher 
8 
AM 
diastolic 
BP 
values. 
Adolescents 
with 
short 
sleep 
duration 
did 
not 
differ 
from 
those 
with 
longer 
sleep 
duration 
in 
regard 
to 
systolic 
BP 
but 
had 
a 
higher 
average 
diastolic 
BP 
and 
higher 
prevalence 
of 
elevated 
diastolic 
BP 
(24.0% 
versus 
2.4%; 
P0.001).

To 
assess 
confounding, 
associations 
among 
the 
sleep 
exposures 
and 
sociodemographic 
characteristics 
were 
examined 
(see 
the 
online 
Data 
Supplement). 
Adolescents 
with 
low 
sleep 
efficiency 
had 
a 
higher 
BMI, 
were 
more 
often 
male, 
and 
were 
from 
households 
with 
lower 
incomes 
and 
lower 
levels 
of 
caregiver 
education. 
These 
characteristics 
were 
not 
significantly 
associated 
with 
short 
sleep 
duration. 
Approximately 
two 
thirds 
(68.0%) 
of 
adolescents 
with 
short 
sleep 
duration 
also 
had 
low 
sleep 
efficiency, 
whereas 
27.9% 
of 
adolescents 
with 
low 
sleep 
efficiency 
also 
had 
short 
sleep 
duration. 
The 
correlation 
between 
mean 
weekday 
sleep 
efficiency 
and 
sleep 
efficiency 
from 
the 
night 
of 
the 
polysomnography 
was 
low 


(r0.13, 
P0.04), 
as 
was 
the 
correlation 
between 
mean 
weekday 
sleep 
duration 
and 
sleep 
duration 
from 
the 
night 
of 
the 
polysomnography 
(r0.06, 
P0.37). 
Approximately 
one 
third 
(32.8%) 
of 
adolescents 
with 
low 
sleep 
efficiency 
as 
assessed 
on 
actigraphy 
also 
had 
low 
sleep 
efficiency 
from 
the 
polysomnography. 


Results 
of 
the 
logistic 
regression 
models 
of 
the 
association 
between 
each 
sleep 
measure 
and 
the 
odds 
of 
prehypertension 
are 
shown 
in 
Tables 
3 
and 
4. 
After 
adjustment 
for 
sex, 
BMI

those 
with 
low

had 
3.5 
times

with 
those 
without 
low

(95%

Short 
sleep 
duration 
was 
associated 
with 
a 
2.8-fold 
increased 
odds 
of 
prehypertension 
in 
unadjusted 
analyses 
(95% 
CI, 
1.07

7.34), 
but 
this 
association 
was 
modestly 
attenuated 
after

z 
score 
(odds 
ratio 
[OR], 
2.54; 
95%

0.93,

The 
unadjusted 
and 
adjusted 
associations 
between 
continuously 
measured 
systolic 
and 
diastolic 
BP 
levels 
with 
sleep 
efficiency 
are 
shown 
in 
Table 
5. 
After 
adjustment 
for 
age, 
sex, 
race, 
term 
status, 
BMI 
percentile, 
and 
SES 
z 
score, 
the 
model 
predicts 
that 
each 
5% 
increase 
in 
sleep 
efficiency 
was 
associated 
with 
a 
1.50.40-mm 
Hg 
decrease 
in 
systolic 
BP 
(P0.001). 
Weaker 
associations 
were 
observed 
between 
sleep 
efficiency 
and 
diastolic 
BP; 
ie, 
each 
5% 
increase 
in 
sleep 
efficiency 
was 
associated 
with 
a 
0.650.35-mm 
Hg 
decrease 
in 
diastolic 
BP 
(P0.05). 
When 
low 
sleep 
efficiency 
was 
modeled 
as 
a 
dichotomous 
exposure, 
the 
adjusted 
model 
estimates 
that 
adolescents 
with 
low 
sleep 
efficiency 
had 
a 
mean 
systolic 
BP 
that 
was 
on 
average 
3.99. 


1.24 
mm 
Hg 
higher 
compared 
with 
those 
with 
higher 
sleep 
efficiency 
(P0.002). 
Including 
sleep 
duration 
as 
a 
continuously 
measured 
covariate 
did 
not 
alter 
the 
primary 
associations 
of 
sleep 
efficiency 
and 
BP 
(data 
not 
shown). 
Similar 
to 
the 
models 
of 
prehypertension, 
sleep 
duration 
was 
more 
weakly 
associated 
with 
continuously 
measured 


systolic 
and 
diastolic 
BPs 
compared 
with 
sleep 
efficiency 
(Table

Additional 
Analyses 


The 
primary 
analyses 
also 
were 
repeated 
with 
low 
sleep 
efficiency 
ascertained 
via 
polysomnography 
as 
the 
exposure. 
Consistent 
with 
the 
results 
of 
the 
primary 
analysis, 
after 
adjustment 
for 
sex, 
BMI 
percentile, 
and 
SES 
z 
score, 
those 
with 
polysomnography 
sleep 
efficiency 
85% 
had 
nearly 
3 
times 
the 
odds 
of 
prehypertension 
as 
those 
with 
better 
sleep 
(OR, 
2.83; 
95% 
CI, 
1.28, 
6.24). 
Also 
consistent 
with 
the 
results 
of 
the 
actigraphy-defined 
sleep 
exposures, 
in 
adjusted 
analyses, 
each 
1% 
increase 
in 
sleep 
efficiency 
was 
associated 
with 
a 
0.200.06-mm 
Hg 
decrease 
in 
systolic 
BP 
(P0.001). 
Similarly, 
those 
with 
low 
polysomnography 
sleep 
efficiency 
had 
systolic 
BP 
that 
was 
3.261.25 
mm 
HG 
higher 
on 
average 
compared 
with 
those 
with 
better 
sleep 
(P0.01). 


Although 
analyses 
were 
restricted 
to 
children 
without 
clinically 
significant 
sleep 
apnea, 
additional 
analyses 
assessed 
potential 
residual 
confounding 
by 
snoring 
or 
the 
apnea–hypopnea 
index 
(ie, 
in 
an 
apnea–hypopnea 
index 
range 
of 
0 
to 
4.9). 
The 
results 
show 
that 
loud 
snoring 
was 
not 
significantly 
associated 
with 
prehypertension, 
systolic 
BP, 
or 
diastolic 
BP. 
In 
contrast,

Discussion 
To 
the 
best 
of 
our 
knowledge, 
this 
is 
the 
first 
reported 
association 
between 
low 
sleep 
efficiency 
and 
short 
sleep 
duration 
objectively 
measured 
in 
the 
child’s 
usual 
sleep 
environment 
with 
elevated 
BP 
(prehypertension 
or 
hypertension) 
in 
adolescents 
without 
clinically 
significant 
levels 
of 
sleep 
apnea. 
Specifically, 
adolescents 
with 
poor 
sleep 
quality, 
as 
measured 
by 
a 
sleep 
efficiency 
of 
85%, 
were 
at 
3.5-fold 
increased 
odds 
of 
being 
prehypertensive 
or 
hypertensive. 
Similar 
findings 
were 
observed 
when 
single-night 
polysomnography 
was 
used 
to 
quantify 
sleep 
efficiency. 
The 
association 
between 
low 
sleep 
efficiency 
and 
prehypertension 
persisted 
even 
after 
adjustment 
for 
sex, 
SES, 
and 
adiposity. 
The 
results 
did 
not 
change 
appreciably 
after 
adjustment 
for 
snoring 
or 
the 
apnea–hypopnea 
index. 
Short 
sleep 
duration 
also 
was 
associated 
with 
a 
2.5-fold 
increase 
in 
the 
odds 
of 
prehypertension 
or 
hypertension. 
However, 
it 
was 
not 
clear 
whether 
this 
association 
was 
attributable 
to 
the 
low 
sleep 
efficiency 
found 
in 
a 
majority 
of 
the 
adolescents 
with 
short 
sleep 
duration. 


In 
adults, 
poor 
sleep 
quality 
identified 
by 
questionnaires 
has 
been 
reported 
in 
association 
with 
an 
increased 
prevalence 
of 
hypertension12 
and 
an 
increased 
rate 
of 
“nondipper 
hypertension.”
28 
However, 
poor 
sleep 
quality 
in 
adults 
often 
occurs 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
primary 
sleep 
disorders 
such 
as 
sleep 
apnea 
or 
insomnia 
or 
secondary 
to 
numerous 
comorbidities. 
Therefore, 
adult 
studies 
reporting 
associations 
with 
disturbed 
or 
reduced 
sleep 
and 
hypertension 
have 
been 
cautiously 
interpreted 
because 
of 
concerns 
about 
residual 
confounding.10 
One 
large 
prospective 
study 
reported 
associations 
of 
short 
sleep 
duration 
in 
women 
but

not 
men8; 
another 
study 
showed 
no 
association 
of 
hypertension 
and 
sleep 
duration 
in 
the 
elderly, 
a 
group 
with 
a 
high 
prevalence 
of 
morbidities.29 
Because 
adolescents 
with 
major 
comorbidities, 
including 
those 
with 
clinically 
significant 
levels 
of 
sleep 
apnea, 
were 
excluded 
from 
our 
analyses 
(to 
minimize 
confounding 
and 
to 
reduce 
measurement 
error), 
it 
is 
unlikely 
that 
major 
confounding 
resulting 
from 
medical 
illnesses, 
medications, 
or 
sleep-
related 
hypoxemia 
explains 
the 
strong 
association 
between 
low 
sleep 
efficiency 
and 
elevated 
BP. 
Given 
that 
the 
association 
between 
BP 
and 
low 
sleep 
efficiency 
persisted 
even 
after 
adjustment 
for 
average 
sleep 
duration, 
our 
findings 
also 
suggest 
that 
recurrent 
arousals 
or 
awakenings 
from 
sleep 
(which 
reduce 
sleep 
efficiency) 
are 
associated 
with 
elevated 
BP. 
Our 
findings 
are 
consistent 
with 
a 
report 
from 
a 
sample 
of 
preadolescent 
children 
studied 
with 
single-night 
polysomnography 
that 
demonstrated 
an 
association 
between 
low 
sleep 
efficiency 
and 
elevated 
BP 
after 
adjustment 
for 
the 
apnea–hypopnea 
index.22 


The 
3.5-fold 
increased 
odds 
of 
prehypertension 
or 
hypertension 
in 
children 
with 
low 
sleep 
efficiency, 
if 
causal, 
suggests 
associations 
with 
a 
potential 
large 
public 
health 
impact. 
Although 
the 
overall 
prevalence 
of 
low 
sleep 
efficiency 
in 
general 
pediatric 
samples 
is 
unknown, 
our 
prevalence 
of 
26% 
is 
likely 
an 
underestimate 
given 
the 
exclusion 
of 
children 
with 
sleep 
disorders 
and 
significant 
comorbidities. 
Our 
finding 
of 
an 
increased 
prevalence 
of 
low 
sleep 
efficiency 
among 
vulnerable 
population 
subgroups 
such 
as 
poorer 
children 
and 
those 
of 
minority 
ethnicity 
may 
be 
of 
special 
concern 
because 
these 
groups 
are 
known 
to 
be 
at 
risk 
for 
hypertension 
and 
other 
adverse 
health 
outcomes. 


Low 
sleep 
efficiency 
was 
associated 
with 
an 
average 
adjusted 
increase 
in 
systolic 
BP 
of 
4 
mm 
Hg. 
Although 
limited 
data 
are 
available 
in 
children 
to 
interpret 
the 
clinical 
significance 
of 
this 
absolute 
elevation, 
large 
cohort 
studies 
suggest 
a 
log-linear 
increase 
in 
morbidity 
in 
association 
with 
incremental 
changes 
in 
systolic 
BP.30 


Short 
sleep 
duration 
was 
associated 
with 
a 
2.5-fold 
increased 
odds 
of 
prehypertension, 
an 
association 
attributable 
partly 
to 
low 
sleep 
efficiency. 
Short 
sleep 
duration 
has 
been 
increasing 
in 
all 
ages31 
and 
is 
associated 
with 
an 
increased 
risk 
for 
obesity.13,16 
–18 
Thus, 
efforts 
to 
optimize 
sleep 
in 
childhood 
may 
improve 
the 
BP 
profile 
of 
children 
through 
obesity-dependent 
and 
-independent

Further 
work 
is 
needed 
to 
dissect 
the 
relative 
influences 
of 
sleep 
curtailment 
from 
sleep 
disruption 
on 
health 
outcomes, 
which 
will 
be 
important 
in 
determining 
whether 
future 
interventions 
would 
be 
best 
directed 
at 
improving 
sleep 
time, 
sleep 
consolidation, 
or 
both. 


The 
cause 
of 
low 
sleep 
efficiency 
in 
healthy 
adolescents 
is 
unclear. 
Sensitivity 
analyses 
did 
not 
indicate 
an 
association 
between 
low 
sleep 
efficiency 
and 
common 
childhood 
disorders 
such 
as 
asthma 
or 
ADHD 
or 
caffeine 
or 
tobacco 
use, 
nor 
were 
these 
variables 
confounders 
in 
the 
association 
between 
sleep 
efficiency 
and 
BP 
(data 
not 
shown). 
It 
is 
possible 
that 
unknown 
psychological 
disorders 
may 
have 
confounded 
our 
results, 
but 
this 
seems 
unlikely 
given 
the 
strong 
associations 
and 
community 
sampling 
design. 


Although 
children 
with 
significant 
sleep 
apnea 
were 
excluded 
from 
our 
analyses, 
the 
apnea–hypopnea 
index 
(in 
a 
range 
of 
0 
to 
4.9) 
was 
significantly 
associated 
with 
prehypertension 
and 
systolic 
BP 
after 
adjustment 
for 
sleep 
efficiency. 
This 
suggests 
that 
even 
mild 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
may 
contribute 
to 
abnormal 
BP 
levels, 
a 
result 
consistent 
with 
reports 
of 
more 
severely 
affected 
children 
from 
sleep 
clinic 
samples.21 


Strengths 
of 
this 
report 
are 
the 
inclusion 
of 
a 
community-
based 
sample 
of 
children, 
minimizing 
referral 
biases, 
and 
the 
use 
of 
objective 
measures 
of 
sleep 
duration 
and 
multiple 
measures 
of 
BP, 
minimizing 
measurement 
error 
and 
reporting 
biases. 
By 
characterizing 
numerous 
risk 
factors 
and 
comorbidities, 
we 
were 
able 
to 
restrict 
the 
analytical 
sample 
to 
children 
without 
disorders 
likely 
to 
confound 
associations 
with 
sleep 
quality. 
Although 
former 
preterm 
children 
were 
overrepresented 
by 
design, 
there 
was 
no 
evidence 
of 
any 
differences 
in 
the 
exposures, 
responses, 
or 
associations 
between 
preterm 
and 
full-term 
children, 
suggesting 
that 
our 
results 
should 
be 
generalizable 
to 
other 
pediatric 
samples. 


There 
are 
no 
established 
cutoffs 
to 
define 
thresholds 
of 
sleep 
duration 
or 
sleep 
efficiency 
that 
increase 
morbidity 
in 
adolescents. 
In 
adults, 
sleep 
durations 
of 
6 
hours 
have 
been 
associated 
with 
a 
variety 
of 
adverse 
health 
outcomes,15,19,32,33 
and 
sleep 
efficiencies 
of 
85% 
are 
considered 
low. 
Our 
choice 
for 
defining 
short 
sleep 
duration 
as 
6.5 
hours 
was 
to 
approximate 
the 
cutoff 
associated 
with 
hypertension 
risk 
in 
adults,10 
which, 
in 
our 
sample, 
represented 
the 
lowest 
decile. 
However, 
examination 
of 
a 
larger 
sample 
may 
permit 
a 
more 
comprehensive 
assessment 
of 
dose 
response 
and 
threshold 
levels 
for 
each 
sleep 
exposure. 


A 
limitation 
of 
this 
cross-sectional 
study 
is 
that 
BP 
status 
was 
determined 
from 
measurements 
made 
on 
2 
consecutive 
days. 
Because 
BP 
may 
vary 
from 
day 
to 
day, 
repeated 
measurements 
over 
time 
are 
needed 
to 
identify 
children 
with 
persistent 
elevations 
in 
BP. 
Another 
limitation 
is 
that 
the 
reported 
associations 
do 
not 
provide 
proof 
of 
causality. 
We 
also 
cannot 
exclude 
the 
possibility 
that 
elevated 
BP 
operates 
as 
a 
risk 
factor 
for 
poor 
sleep. 
It 
is 
important, 
however, 
to 
interpret 
our 
findings 
in 
light 
of 
the 
biological 
plausibility 
of 
the 
observed 
associations 
and 
experimental 
data 
that 
show 
acute 
effects 
of 
sleep 
disruption 
on 
BP. 
Mechanisms 
linking 
poor 
sleep 
efficiency 
or 
sleep 
deprivation 
with 
hypertension 
may 
be 
through 
disruptions 
in 
cortisol 
secretion,19,34,35 
stimulation 
of 
the 
renin-angiotensin 
system 
and 
sympathetic 
nervous 
system 
as 
measured 
by 
increased 
secretion 
of 
cate


cholamines36 
and 
abnormalities 
in 
sympathovagal 
balance,37 
and 
abnormal 
secretion 
of 
vasoactive 
hormones, 
including 
endothelin, 
vasopressin, 
and 
aldosterone.38 
Experimental 
sleep 
disruption 
has 
been 
associated 
with 
elevated 
BP 
in 
sleep 
in 
normal 
subjects.39 
Although 
some 
experimental 
models 
suggest 
that 
sustained 
elevations 
in 
BP 
require 
sleep 
fragmentation 
to 
occur 
in 
a 
background 
of 
intermittent 
hypoxemia40 
(as 
occurs 
with 
sleep 
apnea), 
sleep 
fragmentation 
may 
be 
associated 
with 
elevated 
BP 
even 
in 
adults 
with 
a 
low 
apnea– 
hypopnea 
index41 
or 
with 
simple 
snoring.11 
Prospective 
and 
interventional 
studies 
are 
needed 
to 
provide 
further 
evidence 
of 
causality 
and 
to 
address 
whether 
improving 
sleep 
quality 
and 
duration 
reduces 
BP 
and 
risk 
of 
hypertension. 


Conclusions 
Extensive 
analyses 
using 
objective 
measures 
of 
sleep 
quality 
and 
duration 
and 
multiple 
measures 
of 
BP 
provide 
evidence 
for 
a 
strong 
association 
of 
low 
sleep 
efficiency 
with 
increased 
risk 
of 
prehypertension 
and 
hypertension 
in 
a 
healthy 
sample 
of 
adolescents. 
Our 
data 
suggest 
that 
low 
sleep 
efficiency 
may 
be 
associated 
more 
consistently 
with 
prehypertension 
than 
short 
sleep 
duration. 
Future 
research 
is 
needed 
to 
address 
whether 
prevention 
of 
hypertension 
in 
children 
should 
include 
not 
only 
weight 
management 
and 
exercise 
but 
also 
optimization 
of 
sleep. 
Our 
data 
underscore 
the 
need 
to 
monitor 
the 
quantity 
and 
quality 
of 
sleep 
as 
part 
of 
health 
supervision 
in 
children.

CLINICAL 
PERSPECTIVE 
Childhood 
hypertension 
is 
a 
risk 
factor 
for 
adult 
hypertension 
and 
for 
target-organ 
damage. 
Early 
recognition 
and 
intervention 
of 
childhood 
hypertension 
are 
believed 
to 
be 
important 
in 
reducing 
the 
risk 
of 
cardiovascular 
morbidity 
in 
adulthood. 
Traditional 
approaches 
for 
intervention 
focus 
on 
the 
role 
of 
overweight 
as 
a 
contributing 
cause 
of 
hypertension 
and 
include 
weight 
reduction, 
increased 
physical 
activity, 
and 
nutritional 
changes. 
The 
present 
report 
identifies 
a 
significant 
association 
between 
increased 
blood 
pressure 
and 
poor 
sleep 
quality 
(ie, 
increased 
wake 
time 
during 
the 
sleep 
period), 
found 
in 
26% 
of 
a 
community 
sample 
of 
adolescents. 
Independent 
of 
obesity, 
sex, 
and 
socioeconomic 
status 
and 
unrelated 
to 
sleep 
apnea, 
adolescents 
with 
poor 
sleep 
had 
a 
3.5-fold 
increased 
risk 
of 
prehypertension 
or 
hypertension. 
This 
finding 
suggests 
that 
approaches 
for 
optimizing 
sleep 
quality 
and 
duration 
in 
children 
may 
complement 
other 
behavioral 
approaches 
for 
preventing 
or 
treating 
pediatric 
hypertension. 
Monitoring 
sleep 
quality 
and 
duration 
in 
children 
as 
part 
of 
their 
health 
supervision 
may 
help 
to 
identify 
children 
who 
are 
at 
risk 
for 
both 
sleep 
problems 
and 
hypertension 
and 
who 
would 
benefit 
from 
behavioral 
interventions 
aimed 
at 
improving 
sleep.
