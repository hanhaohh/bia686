Study 
objectives: 
Obstructive 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
is 
accompanied 
by 
episodic 
increases 
in 
left 
ventricle 
afterload 
due 
to 
large 
negative 
swings 
in 
intrathoracic 
pressure 
and 
repetitive 
surges 
in 
arterial 
pressure. 
Brain 
natriuretic 
peptide 
(BNP) 
is 
released 
by 
ventricular 
myocytes 
in 
response 
to 
pressure 
and 
volume 
overload. 
It 
was 
hypothesized 
that 
in 
children 
with 
snoring, 
overnight 
change 
in 
BNP 
levels 
is 
correlated 
with 
severity 
of 
disturbance 
in 
respiration. 
Design: 
Evening 
and 
morning 
plasma 
levels 
of 
BNP 
were 
measured 
in 
children 
with 
snoring 
referred 
for 
polysomnography. 
Setting: 
A 
sleep 
disorders 
laboratory 
in 
a 
university 
hospital. 
Participants: 
Twenty-two 
children 
with 
apnea-hypopnea 
index 
(AHI) 
> 
5/h 
(mean 
. 
SD 
age, 


6.4 
. 
2.5 
years), 
60 
children 
with 
AHI 
< 
5/h 
(mean 
age, 
7 
. 
2.9 
years), 
and 
27 
control 
subjects 
without 
snoring 
(mean 
age, 
7.8 
. 
3.7 
years) 
were 
recruited. 
Measurements 
and 
results: 
Overnight 
change 
in 
BNP 
(log-transformed 
ratio 
of 
morning-toevening 
levels) 
was 
larger 
in 
children 
with 
AHI 
> 
5/h, 
compared 
to 
those 
with 
AHI 
< 
5/h 
or 
to 
control 
subjects 
(0.1 
. 
0.19 
vs 
0.01 
. 
0.14 
vs 
. 
0.06 
. 
0.18; 
p 
< 
0.05). 
Children 
with 
AHI 
> 
5/h 
had 
an 
odds 
ratio 
of 
4.33 
(95% 
confidence 
interval, 
1.34 
to 
14) 
for 
change 
in 
peptide 
levels 
> 
0.15 
relatively 
to 
subjects 
with 
AHI 
< 
5/h. 
AHI 
and 
oxygen 
saturation 
of 
hemoglobin 
nadir 
were 
significant 
predictors 
of 
overnight 
change 
in 
peptide 
levels. 
Conclusions: 
In 
children 
with 
snoring, 
overnight 
increase 
in 
BNP 
levels 
is 
correlated 
with 
severity 
of 
disturbance 
in 
respiration 
during 
sleep, 
which 
may 
indicate 
presence 
of 
nocturnal 
cardiac 
strain.

cular 
morbidity. 
These 
alterations 
include 
but 
are 
not 
limited 
to 
endothelial 
dysfunction 
and 
decreased 
arterial 
distensibility2,3; 
inflammation 
and 
metabolic 
disturbances4–8; 
hypertension9–11; 
and 
changes 
in 
cardiac 
structure 
and 
function.2,12–15 
Hence, 
it 
is 
not 
surprising 
that 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
in 
adults 
has 
been 
correlated 
with 
coronary 
artery 
disease, 
congestive 
heart 
failure, 
and 
stroke.16 


Furthermore, 
obstructive 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
in 
adults 
has 
been 
related 
to 
acute 
detrimental 
effects 
on 
the 
cardiovascular 
system, 
such 
as 
repetitive 
nocturnal 
oscillations 
in 
arterial 
BP,17 
that 
may 
also 
contribute 
to 
increased 
long-term 
cardiovascular 
morbidity. 
At 
the 
termination 
of 
an 
obstructive 
event, 
systemic 
BP 
rises, 
whereas 
cardiac 
stroke 
volume 
decreases 
probably 
because 
of 
increased 
ventricular 
afterload.18 
This 
response 
of 
the 
cardiovascular 
system 
to 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
has 
been 
attributed 
to 
peripheral 
vasoconstriction 
resulting 
from 
sympathetic 
nervous 
system 
activation 
secondary 
to 
hypoxemia 
and 
microarousals.19,20 


Several 
reports 
in 
children 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea-hypopnea 
have 
provided 
evidence 
consistent 
with 
long-term 
effects 
of 
increased 
load 
(strain) 
of 
the 
cardiac 
ventricles 
during 
apneic 
events. 
Severe 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea-hypopnea 
may 
be 
accompanied 
by 
cor 
pulmonale,21,22 
and 
decreased 
right 
ventricular 
ejection 
fraction.12,13 
Reports14,15 
suggest 
that 
higher 
apnea-hypopnea 
index 
(AHI) 
is 
correlated 
with 
increased 
left 
cardiac 
ventricle 
mass 
index 
and 
decreased 
diastolic 
function. 


Brain 
natriuretic 
peptide 
(BNP) 
is 
a 
neurohormone 
released 
by 
the 
cardiac 
ventricles 
in 
response 
to 
volume 
and 
pressure 
overload 
as 
it 
occurs 
in 
adult 
subjects 
with 
congestive 
heart 
failure 
or 
acute 
myocardial 
infarction.23–25 
In 
one 
study,26 
overnight 
increase 
of 
plasma 
BNP 
levels 
was 
documented 
in 
adults 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
but 
not 
in 
control 
subjects, 
most 
likely 
secondary 
to 
increased 
cardiac 
load 
related 
to 
intermittent 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
during 
sleep. 
The 
main 
hypothesis 
of 
the 
current 
investigation 
has 
been 
that 
in 
children 
with 
habitual 
snoring, 
the 
higher 
the 
severity 
of 
obstructive 
sleep-
disordered 
breathing, 
the 
larger 
the 
overnight 
change 
in 
plasma 
concentration 
of 
BNP. 
If 
this 
hypothesis 
is 
valid, 
the 
overnight 
increase 
in 
BNP 
levels 
in 
children 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
may 
indicate 
presence 
of 
cardiac 
ventricular 
strain. 


Materials 
and 
Methods 


Recruitment 
of 
Subjects 
and 
Clinical 
Evaluation 


The 
study 
protocol 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
University 
of 
Thessaly 
Ethics 
Committee. 
Informed 
consent 
was 
obtained 
from 
parents 
of 
participants 
and 
the 
child’s 
assent 
from 
subjects 
. 
6 
years 
old. 


Consecutive 
children 
with 
snoring 
(. 
3 
nights/wk) 
for 
the 
last 
6 
months 
who 
were 
referred 
to 
the 
sleep 
disorders 
laboratory 
were 
eligible 
for 
participation. 
Children 
without 
snoring 
were 
recruited 
as 
control 
subjects. 
Exclusion 
criteria 
for 
participation 
of 
children 
with 
snoring 
or 
of 
control 
subjects 
without 
snoring 
were 
symptoms 
of 
respiratory 
tract 
infection, 
and 
history 
of 
cardiovascular, 
renal, 
neuromuscular, 
or 
genetic 
disorders. 
Eighteen 
participants 
of 
this 
investigation 
have 
also 
been 
included 
in 
a 
previous 
study27 
by 
the 
current 
authors. 


Parents 
were 
interviewed 
regarding 
symptoms 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
and 
a 
history 
of 
adenoidectomy 
or 
tonsillectomy. 
Subjects 
underwent 
a 
physical 
examination, 
and 
body 
mass 
index 
z-score 
was 
calculated.28 
Morning 
BP 
was 
measured 
three 
times, 
and 
the 
average 
value 
was 
used 
in 
statistical 
analysis.29 
To 
control 
for 
the 
effect 
of 
age, 
gender, 
and 
height 
on 
BP, 
an 
index 
was 
calculated: 
(average 
measured 
value 
. 
95th 
percentile 
value) 
. 
100/95th 
percentile 
value.29,30 


Polysomnography 


All 
participants, 
except 
for 
control 
subjects 
without 
snoring, 
underwent 
overnight 
polysomnography 
in 
the 
Sleep 
Disorders 
Laboratory 
of 
Larissa 
University 
Hospital 
under 
the 
supervision 
of 
trained 
personnel. 
The 
Alice 
4 
computerized 
system 
(Healthdyne; 
Marietta, 
GA) 
was 
used 
to 
record 
the 
following 
parameters: 
EEG 
(C3/A2, 
C4/A1, 
O1/A2); 
right 
and 
left 
oculogram; 
submental 
and 
tibial 
electromyogram; 
body 
position; 
ECG; 
thoracic 
and 
abdominal 
wall 
motion 
(piezoelectric 
transducers); 
oronasal 
airflow 
(three-pronged 
thermistor); 
and 
oxygen 
saturation 
of 
hemoglobin 
(Sao2). 
End-tidal 
carbon 
dioxide 
was 
not 
monitored 
during 
the 
sleep 
study. 
Bedtime 
was 
determined 
by 
each 
child’s 
routine, 
and 
polysomnography 
was 
terminated 
on 
final 
awakening. 


Arousals 
and 
sleep 
stages 
were 
assessed 
using 
standard 
criteria.
31,32 
Total 
sleep 
time 
was 
determined 
based 
on 
both 
EEG 
and 
the 
laboratory 
technician’s 
notes. 
Obstructive 
apnea 
was 
defined 
as 
the 
presence 
of 
chest/abdominal 
wall 
motion 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
airflow 
for 
at 
least 
two 
breaths 
in 
duration.10,33 
Hypopnea 
was 
defined 
as 
follows: 
(1) 
a 
reduction 
in 
the 
airflow 
signal 
amplitude 
of 
at 
least 
50% 
compared 
to 
baseline, 
(2) 
presence 
of 
chest/ 
abdominal 
wall 
motion, 
and 
(3) 
association 
with 
oxygen 
desaturation 
of 
hemoglobin 
. 
4% 
or 
with 
an 
arousal.30 
The 
AHI 
is 
the 
number 
of 
obstructive 
and 
mixed 
apneas 
(apneas 
with 
both 
central 
and 
obstructive 
components) 
and 
hypopneas 
per 
hour 
of 
sleep. 
The 
frequency 
of 
arousals 
terminating 
apneas 
or 
hypopneas 
determined 
the 
respiratory 
arousal 
index. 
The 
number

nadir, 
and 
percentage 
of 
sleep 
time 
with 
Sao2 
. 
95% 
were 
also 
calculated. 


BNP 
Measurement 


Venous 
blood 
collection 
was 
performed 
prior 
to 
bedtime 
and 
between 
8:00 
am 
and 
10:00 
am. 
BNP 
concentration 
was 
measured 
in 
ethylenediamine 
tetra-acetic 
acid-anticoagulated 
blood 
using 
the 
Triage 
Meter 
Plus 
device 
(Biosite 
Diagnostics; 
San

immediately 
after 
blood 
sample 
collection.34 
Inter-

coefficients 
of 
variation 
of 
this 
fluorescent 
immunoassay 
are 
as 
follows: 
10%, 
12.4%,

14.8% 
for 
BNP 
concentrations 
of 


28.8 
pg/mL, 
584

sleep-disordered 
breathing 
compared 
to 
subjects 
with 
mild 
disturbance 
in

and 
(3)

The 
AHI 
cutoff 
value 
of 
5/h 
was 
selected 
because 
in 
many 
pediatric 
hospitals 
this 
value 
is 
used 
as 
an 
indication 
for 
adenotonsillectomy 
in 
children 
with 
snoring.35 


BNP 
values 
were 
log-transformed 
to 
obtain 
a 
normal 
distribution. 
Study 
groups 
were 
compared 
regarding 
evening 
and 
morning 
BNP 
plasma 
levels, 
overnight 
change 
in 
BNP 
(log-transformed 
morning-to-evening

ratio), 
and 
variables 
that 
may 
affect 
the 
previous 
values. 
2 
test 
was 
applied 
for 
comparisons 
regarding 
categorical 
characteristics, 
and 
one-way 
analysis 
of

was 
used 
for 
continuous

One-way 
analysis 
of

was 
followed 
by 
post

tests 
for 
pair 
comparisons 
between 
study 
groups. 
The 
two 
groups 
of

Since 
this 
was 
the

several 
cutoff

were 
explored 
for 
estimating 
the

The

correlated 
with 
indices 
of 
severity 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing. 
Children 
with 
AHI 
. 
5/h 
have 
a 
four-times-higher 
risk 
for 
nocturnal 
increase 
in 
BNP 
(log-transformed 
morning-to-evening 
BNP 
ratio) 
. 
0.15 
compared 
to 
subjects 
with 
AHI 
. 
5/h. 
We 
speculate 
that 
overnight 
change 
in 
BNP 
concentration 
is 
the 
result 
of 
raised 
cardiac 
ventricular 
load 
associated 
with 
intermittent 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
during 
sleep. 


Log-transformed 
morning-to-evening 
BNP 
ratio 
was 
associated 
not 
only 
with 
AHI 
but 
also 
with 
variables 
describing 
oxygenation 
during 
sleep 
(eg, 
oxygen 
desaturation 
of 
hemoglobin 
index). 
This 
is 
because 
the 
definition 
of 
AHI 
incorporates 
episodes 
of 
oxygen 
desaturation 
of 
hemoglobin 
and 
thus 
AHI 
correlates 
with 
polysomnography 
indices 
describing 
oxygenation. 
It 
is 
surprising 
that 
there 
was 
a 
negative 
univariate 
correlation 
between 
overnight 
change 
in 
BNP 
and 
BMI 
z-score, 
as 
one 
would 
expect 
that 
more 
obese 
children 
would 
have 
more 
severe 
sleep-
disordered 
breathing. 
However, 
in 
participants 
of 
the 
current 
report 
AHI 
was 
not 
associated 
with 
BMI 
z-score. 


BNP 
has 
been 
named 
so 
because 
it 
has 
been 
initially 
detected 
in 
porcine 
brain,36 
although 
its 
concentration 
is 
much 
higher 
in 
the 
heart.37 
It 
is 
produced 
mainly 
by 
myocytes 
of 
the 
cardiac 
ventricles 
as 
a 
prohormone 
and 
is 
released 
in 
the 
circulation 
in 
response 
to 
increased 
pressure 
and 
volume 
cardiac 
load 
(ventricular 
strain). 
Acute 
overload 
of 
the 
cardiac 
ventricles 
leads 
to 
induction 
of 
BNP 
gene 
expression 
and 
secretion 
of 
the 
peptide 
in 
the 
bloodstream.
23 
Increased 
levels 
of 
BNP 
have 
been 
reported 
in 
children 
with 
heart 
failure 
of 
various 
causes, 
congenital 
cardiac 
anomalies 
causing 
left-toright 
shunt, 
or 
pulmonary 
hypertension.38 
Vasodilatation 
and 
natriuresis 
are 
some 
of 
the 
BNP 
biological 
actions 
that 
tend 
to 
reduce 
cardiac 
ventricular 
overload.
39 


Other 
conditions 
except 
for 
direct 
increased 
load 
to 
ventricular 
myocardium 
that 
may 
affect 
release 
of 
BNP 
include 
traumatic 
brain 
injury,40 
hyperthyroidism,
41 
cirrhosis,42 
biliary 
atresia 
associated 
with 
cirrhosis,
43 
liver 
transplantation,43 
and 
chronic 
renal 
failure.44 
No 
participants 
in 
the 
present 
investigation 
had 
any 
of 
the 
previous 
disorders, 
and 
for

while

been 
identified 
by

and 
radionuclide 
ventriculography 
in 
pediatric 
subjects 
with 
adenotonsillar

and

Both 
right 
and

cardiac

improve 
after 
adenotonsillectomy.12 
Amin 
and 
colleagues14 
reported 
that 
in 
children 
with 
snoring 
the 
higher 
the 
AHI, 
the 
higher 
the 
risk 
for 
increased 
right 
cardiac 
ventricle 
end-diastolic 
dimension 
and 
increased 
left 
ventricle 
mass 
index. 
The 
same 
investigators15 
found 
a 
negative 
correlation 
between 
severity 
of 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea-hypopnea 
and 
left 
cardiac 
ventricle 
diastolic 
function. 


Mechanisms 
responsible 
for 
the 
presence 
of 
ventricular 
strain 
and 
abnormalities 
in 
myocardial 
structure 
and 
function 
in 
children 
with 
intermittent 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
during 
sleep 
have 
not 
been 
fully 
clarified.12–15 
Evidence 
from 
studies45,46 
in 
adults 
and 
experimental 
animals 
indicate 
that 
at 
the 
termination 
of 
apnea, 
stroke 
volume 
of 
both 
the 
right 
and 
left 
cardiac 
ventricles 
decreases. 
Reduction 
in 
stroke 
volume 
may 
be 
due 
to 
increased 
ventricular 
afterload 
secondary 
to 
repetitive 
increases 
in 
pulmonary 
artery 
pressure 
and 
systemic 
BP 
(peripheral 
vasoconstriction) 
at 
the 
end 
of 
an 
obstructive 
event.19,47 


In 
addition, 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
is 
accompanied 
by 
exaggerated 
negative 
intrathoracic 
pressure 
swings, 
increased 
systemic 
venous 
return, 
and 
preload 
to 
the 
right 
ventricle 
that 
displaces 
the 
intraventricular 
septum 
toward 
the 
left 
ventricle 
free 
wall.12 
This 
displacement 
impairs 
left 
cardiac 
ventricle 
filling 
and 
along 
with 
increased 
afterload 
contributes 
to 
the 
reduction 
in 
stroke 
volume.18,46 
Increased 
left 
cardiac 
ventricle 
afterload 
is 
probably 
due 
not 
only 
to 
peripheral 
vasoconstriction 
but 
also 
to 
large 
negative 
swings 
in 
intrathoracic 
pressure.47,48 


Chronic 
nocturnal 
increase 
in 
ventricular 
afterload 
may 
lead 
to 
increased 
left 
cardiac 
ventricle 
mass, 
an 
important 
risk 
factor 
for 
future 
cardiovascular 
disease 
such 
as 
congestive 
heart 
failure.49 
Therefore, 
changes 
in 
cardiac 
structure14 
and 
function,12,13,15 
along 
with: 
(1) 
reduced 
arterial 
distensibility3; 
(2) 
increased 
BP 
variability, 
decreased 
nocturnal 
BP 
dipping, 
or 
even 
sustained 
BP 
elevation10,11,30; 
and 


(3) 
chronic 
inflammation 
and 
insulin 
resistance,5,6,8 
may 
predispose 
children 
with 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
to 
increased 
risk 
for 
cardiovascular 
morbidity 
in 
adulthood. 
In 
the 
above 
described 
context, 
the 
usefulness 
of 
measuring 
plasma 
BNP 
levels 
in 
children 
with 
sleep-
disordered 
breathing 
remains 
to 
be 
elucidated. 
Further 
studies 
are 
necessary 
to 
investigate 
the 
possible 
correlation 
of 
cardiac 
ventricle 
anatomy 
and 
function 
with 
overnight 
change 
in 
BNP 
plasma 
concentration 
as 
well 
as 
the 
potential 
effect 
of 
adenotonsillectomy 


on 
BNP 
levels. 
If 
such 
correlations 
exist, 
then 
BNP 
could 
be 
possibly 
used 
in 
clinical 
practice 
as 
an 
index 
of 
increased 
ventricular 
load 
secondary 
to 
intermittent 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
during 
sleep. 


It 
should 
be 
noted, 
however, 
that 
correlation 
of 
the 
overnight 
change 
in 
BNP 
levels 
with 
AHI 
is 
rather 
weak 
and 
there 
is 
overlap 
between 
low-AHI 
and 
high-AHI 
subjects 
regarding 
this 
change. 
The 
previous 
observation 
indicates 
that 
intermittent 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
during 
sleep 
is 
only 
one 
of 
the 
factors 
affecting 
BNP 
plasma 
levels 
and 
that 
other 
parameters 
possibly 
play 
an 
important 
role 
in 
BNP 
release 
from 
ventricular 
myocytes 
overnight. 


Two 
important 
arguments 
against 
the 
speculation 
that 
overnight 
increase 
in 
BNP 
plasma 
concentration 
reflects 
acute 
strain 
of 
the 
cardiac 
ventricles 
associated 
with 
nocturnal 
intermittent 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
need 
to 
be 
discussed. 
First, 
the 
magnitude 
of 
mean 
overnight 
BNP 
change 
in 
children 
with 
sleep 
apnea 
is 
small 
(approximately 
25%) 
compared 
to 
the 
dramatic 
rise 
of 
BNP 
levels 
in 
children 
and 
adults 
with 
congestive 
heart 
failure.24,34,50 
Nevertheless, 
clinical 
presentation 
and 
myocardial 
strain 
in 
subjects 
with 
cardiac 
failure 
are 
far 
more 
severe 
than 
the 
subtle 
abnormalities 
identified 
by 
echocardiography 
in 
otherwise 
healthy 
children 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea. 


Second, 
studies26,51 
assessing 
the 
correlation 
of 
BNP 
levels 
with 
severity 
of 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
in 
adults 
have 
provided 
contradictory 
results. 
Kita 
and 
colleagues26 
recorded 
increasing 
BNP 
levels 
in 
the 
second 
half 
of 
sleep 
time 
(2:00 
to 
6:00 
am) 
that 
was 
correlated 
with 
average 
apnea 
duration. 
Svatikova 
and 
colleagues51 
did 
not 
identify 
a 
change 
in 
BNP 
concentration 
between 
2 
am 
and 
6 
am, 
but 
during 
this 
sleep 
period 
participants 
were 
undergoing 
a 
therapeutic 
continuous 
positive 
airway 
pressure 
trial. 
Since 
BNP 
should 
be 
first 
synthesized 
and 
then 
released 
by 
ventricular 
myocytes 
in 
response 
to 
pressure 
and 
volume 
overload, 
it 
is 
conceivable 
that 
BNP 
levels 
do 
not 
increase 
in 
adults 
with 
sleep 
apnea 
prior 
to 
midnight. 
In 
a 
third 
investigation,52 
adult 
subjects 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
and 
controls 
free 
of 
sleep 
disturbances 
were 
recruited. 
BNP 
levels 
were 
measured 
only 
in 
the 
morning, 
and 
no 
difference 
was 
identified 
between 
study 
groups. 
Treatment 
with 
continuous 
positive 
airway 
pressure 
for 
12 
to 
17 
months 
did 
not 
affect 
morning 
BNP 
plasma 
concentrations. 


When 
male 
subjects 
with 
a 
mean 
age 
of 
68.6 
. 
10 
years 
and 
congestive 
heart 
failure 
were 
studied,53 
it 
was 
demonstrated 
that 
the 
lower 
the 
left 
ventricular 
ejection 
fraction, 
the 
higher 
the 
prevalence 
of 
sleep-
disordered 
breathing 
and 
the 
concentration 
of 
BNP. 
This 
finding 
was 
in 
contrast 
to 
results 
of 
another 
investigation54 
that 
recruited 
male 
and 
female 
sub

nocturnal
