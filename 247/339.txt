Background: 
Fatty 
liver 
disease 
(FLD) 
is 
a 
highly 
prevalent 
condition 
in 
obese 
(Ob) 
children, 
who 
are 
at 
increased 
risk 
for 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
(OSA). 
However, 
the 
contribution 
of 
OSA 
to 
FLD 
remains 
unknown. 
Design: 
Prospective 
study. 
Setting: 
Polysomnographic 
evaluation 
and 
assessment 
of 
plasma 
levels 
of 
insulin, 
glucose, 
and 
lipids, 
and 
liver 
function 
tests. 
Participants: 
A 
total 
of 
518 
consecutive 
snoring 
children 
4 
to 
17 
years 
of 
age 
who 
were 
being 
evaluated 
for 
habitual 
snoring 
and 
suspected 
OSA. 
Results: 
A 
total 
of 
376 
children 
had 
body 
mass 
index 
z 
score 
of 
< 
1.20 
(non-Ob 
children), 
3 
children 
(<1%) 
had 
elevated 
serum 
aminotransferase 
(LFT) 
levels, 
and 
248 
had 
OSA 
(65.9%). 
Among 
the 
142 
overweight/Ob 
children, 
46 
had 
elevated 
LFT 
levels 
(32.4%); 
of 
these 
children, 
42 
had 
OSA 
(91.3%). 
In 
contrast, 
OSA 
was 
present 
in 
only 
71.8% 
of 
Ob 
children 
without 
elevated 
LFT 
level 
(p 
< 
0.01). 
Insulin 
resistance 
and 
hyperlipidemia 
were 
more 
likely 
to 
occur 
in 
children 
with 
FLD. 
Furthermore, 
FLD 
was 
improved 
after 
treatment 
of 
OSA 
in 
32 
of 
42 
Ob 
children 
(p 
< 
0.0001). 
Conclusion: 
Increased 
liver 
enzyme 
levels 
are 
frequently 
found 
in 
Ob 
snoring 
children, 
particularly 
among 
those 
with 
OSA 
and/or 
metabolic 
dysfunction. 
Effective 
treatment 
of 
OSA 
results 
in 
improved 
liver 
function 
test 
results 
in 
the 
vast 
majority 
of 
these 
patients.

onalcoholic 
fatty 
liver 
disease 
(FLD) 
is 
currently 
considered 
to 
be 
the 
most 
common 
cause 
of 
liver 
disease 
in 
children.1 
FLD 
encompasses 
a 
wide 
spectrum 
of 
hepatic 
abnormalities 
ranging 
from 
simple 
steatosis 
to 
progressive 
liver 
inflammation 
and 
cell 
injury, 
which 
may 
ultimately 
lead 
to 
cirrhosis 
and 
end-stage 
liver 
disease 
in 
some 
children.2–4 
Obesity, 
insulin 
resistance, 
and 
type 
2 
diabetes 
have 
been 
identified 
as 
risk 
factors 
for 
FLD.5,6 
While 
the 
prevalence 
of 
FLD 
has 
not 
been 
firmly 
established, 
it 
appears 
to 
affect 
around 
3% 
of 
the 
general 
population, 
based 
on 
several 
surveys 
from 
around 
the 
world.6–8 
However, 
obese 
(Ob) 
children 
are 
at 
much 


higher 
risk 
for 
FLD, 
with 
prevalence 
rates 
reported 
between 
6% 
for 
overweight 
children 
to 
23% 
among 
Ob 
children.6,9 


Obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
(OSA) 
has 
emerged 
in 
the 
past 
few 
years 
as 
a 
highly 
prevalent 
condition 
in 
pediatric 
populations. 
Similar 
to 
FLD, 
one 
of 
the 
main 
risk 
factors 
for 
OSA 
is 
obesity. 
Furthermore, 
mutual 
interactions 
among 
OSA, 
obesity, 
and 
insulin 
resistance 
have 
emerged, 
and 
may 
involve 
systemic 
inflammatory 
responses.10–14 
However, 
we 
are 
unaware 
of 
any 
study 
assessing 
the 
potential 
relationship 
between 
OSA 
and 
FLD 
in 
children. 
In 
adults,

increased 
prevalence 
of 
OSA 
symptoms

OSA 
appears 
to 
occur 
among 
patients 
with 
nonalcoholic 
steatohepatitis,15,16 
and, 
conversely, 
among 
adult 
patients 
being 
evaluated 
for 
habitual 
snoring 
and 
suspected 
OSA, 
elevated 
body 
mass 
index 
(BMI) 
values 
and 
the 
presence 
of 
OSA 
were 
both 
independently 
associated 
with 
increased 
levels 
of 
serum 
aminotransferases 
(LFTs).17 
Furthermore, 
it 
has 
been 
reported18 
that 
the 
treatment 
of 
Ob 
adults 
with 
OSA 
with 
nasal 
continuous 
positive 
airway 
pressure 
(CPAP) 
was 
associated 
with 
a 
decrease 
in 
LFT 
levels. 


Based 
on 
the 
aforementioned 
considerations, 
we 
conducted 
the 
present 
study 
to 
examine 
the 
hypothesis 
that 
the 
prevalence 
of 
elevated 
LFT 
levels 
among 
children 
with 
habitual 
snoring 
who 
were 
being 
evaluated 
for 
suspected 
OSA 
would 
be 
greatest 
among 
Ob 
snoring 
children 
with 
OSA. 
Furthermore, 
we 
sought 
to 
examine 
whether 
effective 
therapy 
of 
OSA 
among 
children 
with 
FLD 
and 
OSA 
would 
lead 
to 
improvements 
in 
circulating 
levels 
of 
transaminases. 


Materials 
and 
Methods 


Five 
hundred 
eighteen 
children 
between 
the 
ages 
of 
4 
and 
17 
years 
who 
were 
consecutively 
evaluated 
at 
the 
Kosair 
Children’s 
Hospital 
Sleep 
Medicine 
Center 
for 
habitual 
snoring 
and 
suspected 
OSA 
were 
recruited 
into 
the 
study. 
The 
study 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
University 
of 
Louisville 
Human 
Research 
Committee. 
Parental 
informed 
consent 
and 
child 
assent, 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
a 
parent, 
were 
obtained. 
Children 
were 
excluded 
if 
they 
had 
any 
chronic 
medical 
condition, 
were 
receiving 
medications 
known 
to 
affect 
glucose 
homeostasis 
or 
to 
affect 
liver 
function 
test 
results, 
and 
if 
they 
had 
any 
genetic 
or 
craniofacial 
syndromes. 


A 
standard 
overnight 
multichannel 
polysomnographic 
evaluation 
was 
performed 
in 
the 
sleep 
laboratory, 
as 
described 
previously.
19 
Sleep 
architecture 
was 
assessed 
by 
standard 
techniques.20 
The 
proportion 
of 
time 
spent 
in 
each 
sleep 
stage 
was 
expressed 
as 
the 
percentage 
of 
total 
sleep 
time 
(TST). 
Central, 
obstructive, 
and 
mixed 
apneic 
events 
were 
counted. 
Obstructive 
apnea 
was 
defined 
as 
the 
absence 
of 
airflow 
with 
continued 
chest 
wall

The 
obstructive 
apnea-hypopnea 
index 
(AHI) 
was 
defined 
as 
the 
number 
of 
apneas 
and 
hypopneas 
occurring 
per 
hour 
of 
TST. 
Arousals 
were 
defined 
as 
recommended 
by 
the 
American 
Sleep 
Disorders 
Association 
Task 
Force 
report,22,23 
and 
included 
respiratory-related 
(occurring 
immediately 
following 
an 
apnea, 
hypopnea, 
or 
snore), 
technician-
induced, 
and 
spontaneous 
arousals. 
Arousals 
were 
expressed 
as 
the 
total 
number 
of 
arousals 
per 
hour 
of 
sleep 
time 
(arousal 
index). 
Children 
with 
an 
AHI 
of 
. 
2 
were 
considered 
to 
have 
habitual 
snoring, 
while 
children 
with 
an 
AHI 
of 
. 
2 
events 
per 
hour 
of 
TST 
were 
considered 
to 
have 
OSA.19 
For 
treatment 
purposes, 
children 
with 
OSA 
were 
initially 
referred 
for 
tonsillectomy 
and 
adenoidectomy 
(T&A), 
and 
8 
to 
12 
weeks 
after 
surgery 
underwent 
an 
additional 
overnight 
sleep 
study. 
If 
the 
postsurgical 
residual 
AHI 
was 
. 
5 
events 
per 
hour 
of 
TST, 
therapy 
with 
CPAP 
applied 
via 
nasal 
mask 
was 
instituted 
and 
optimized 
in 
the 
sleep 
laboratory. 
Effective 
adherence 
to 
CPAP 
therapy 
was 
considered 
when 
children 
used 
the 
CPAP 
device 
every 
night 
for 
at 
least 
6 
h 
per 
night. 


BMI 


Height 
and 
weight 
were 
obtained 
from 
each 
child 
using 
standard 
techniques. 
BMI 
was 
then 
calculated 
(body 
mass/height 
squared) 
and 
was 
expressed 
as 
the 
BMI 
z 
score 
using 
an 
online 
BMI 
z 
score 
calculator 
(http://www.cdc.gov/epiinfo/). 
Children 
with 
BMI 
z 
score 
values 
exceeding 
1.20 
were 
classified 
as 
fulfilling 
the 
criteria 
for 
overweight/obesity.24 


Blood 
Samples 


Blood 
for 
all 
of 
the 
assays 
reported 
was 
drawn 
the 
morning 
after 
the 
sleep 
study 
after 
an 
overnight 
fast. 
Plasma 
insulin 
levels 
were 
measured 
using 
a 
commercially 
available 
radioimmunoassay 
kit 
(Coat-A-Count 
Insulin; 
Cambridge 
Diagnostic 
Products, 
Inc; 
Fort 
Lauderdale, 
FL). 
This 
method 
has 
a 
detection 
level 
of 
1.2 
IU/mL 
and 
exhibits 
linear 
behavior 
up 
to 
350 
IU/mL, 
with 
intraassay 
and 
interassay 
coefficients 
of 
variability 
of 
3.1% 
and 
4.9%, 
respectively. 
Plasma 
glucose 
levels 
were 
measured 
using 
a 
commercial 
kit 
based 
on 
the 
hexokinase-glucose-6-phosphate 
dehydrogenase 
method 
(Flex 
Reagent 
Cartridges; 
Dade 
Behring; 
Newark, 
DE). 
Insulin 
sensitivity 
was 
assessed 
using 
the 
fasting 
insulin/fasting 
glucose 
(I/G) 
ratio, 
as 
previously 
reported.25 
Insulin 
resistance 
was 
defined 
as 
fasting 
serum 
insulin 
levels 
of 
. 
25 
IU/mL 
or 
an 
I/G 
ratio 
of 
. 
0.30.25 
Serum 
lipids 
including 
total 
cholesterol, 
high-density 
lipoprotein 
cholesterol, 
calculated 
low-
density 
lipoprotein 
cholesterol, 
and 
triglycerides 
were 
also 
assessed 
(Flex 
Reagent 
Cartridges; 
Dade 
Behring). 


Since 
serum 
levels 
of 
alanine 
aminotransferase 
(ALT) 
and 
aspartate 
aminotransferase 
(AST) 
are 
the 
most 
commonly 
used 
screening 
tools 
used 
to 
detect 
FLD, 
we 
used 
these 
measurements 
as 
a 
surrogate 
marker 
for 
suspected 
FLD.26 
ALT 
and 
AST 
were 
determined 
using 
a 
standard 
automated 
kinetic 
enzymatic 
assay. 
Although 
there 
is 
no 
single 
standard 
cutoff 
point 
for 
abnormal 
LFT 
levels, 
the 
most 
commonly 
used 
criterion 
is 
a 
value 
of 
. 
40 
U/L 
for 
both 
ALT 
and 
AST.27 
To 
strengthen 
the 
use 
of 
ALT 
and 
AST 
as 
surrogates 
for 
FLD, 
we 
attempted 
when 
possible 
to 
exclude 
other 
causes 
of 
chronic 
hepatitis, 
including 
hepatitis 
B 
(hepatitis 
B 
surface 
antigen), 
hepatitis 
C 
(antihepatitis 
C 
antibody), 
1-antitrypsin 
deficiency 
(serum 
1-antitrypsin 
level), 
autoimmune 
hepatitis 
(antinuclear 
antibody), 
and 
Wilson 
disease 
(serum 
ceruloplasmin). 
In 
some 
cases, 
ultrasonographic 
assessment 
of 
the 
liver 
was 
conducted 
for 
the 
identification 
of 
echogenic 
evidence 
of 
liver 
steatosis.

children 
with 
OSA, 
44 
children 
had 
elevated 
liver 
function 
test 
results 
(12.8%) 
compared 
to 
only 
5 
children 
with 
elevated 
serum 
transaminase 
levels 
among 
the 
175 
children 
without 
OSA 
(2.8%; 
p 
. 
0.0001; 
odds 
ratio 
[OR], 
5.15; 
95% 
confidence 
interval 
[CI], 
1.95 
to 
15.06). 
Similarly, 
376 
of 
the 
habitually 
snoring 
children 
recruited 
into 
the 
study 
had 
BMI 
z 
scores 
of 
. 
1.20 
and 
were 
considered 
as 
non-Ob 
(NOb). 
Among 
the 
NOb 
habitually 
snoring 
children, 
3 
children 
had 


evidence 
of 
elevated 
ALT 
or 
AST 
levels 
(. 
1%) 
and 
232 
fulfilled 
the 
polysomnographic 
criteria 
for 
OSA 
(61.7%) 
[Table 
2]. 
Two 
of 
these 
three 
children 
had 
severe 
OSA, 
and 
in 
the 
third, 
ALT 
values 
returned 
to 
normal 
2 
weeks 
later 
without 
intervention. 


Thus, 
the 
142 
remaining 
children 
fulfilled 
the 
criteria 
for 
the 
overweight/Ob 
category 
(ie,BMIz 
score, 
. 
1.20). 
Of 
these, 
111 
children 
(78.2%) 
had 
polysomnographic 
evidence 
of 
OSA, 
and 
46 
fulfilled 
the 
serologic 
criteria 
for 
FLD 
(32.4%). 
Of 
note, 
most 
of 
the 
children 
had 
isolated 
elevations 
of 
ALT, 
with 
only 
13 
of 
the 
46 
children 
also 
having 
increased 
AST 
levels. 
Therefore, 
most 
of 
the 
analyses 
regarding 
FLD 
were 
conducted 
using 
ALT 
concentrations 
only. 
There 
were 
no 
significant 
relationships 
between 
BMI 
z 
score 
and 
ALT 
levels 
for 
either 
the 
whole 
cohort 
or 
for 
those 
children 
with 
BMI 
z 
scores 
of 
. 
1.20. 
Among 
the 
46 
Ob 
children 
with 
FLD, 
34 
were 
evaluated 
and 
had 
no 
serologic 
evidence 
of 
chronic 
liver 
disease. 
Twelve 
of 
the 
46 
children 
with 
suspected 
FLD 
also 
underwent 
ultrasonographic 
liver 
evaluations, 
and 
evidence 
for 
steatosis 
was 
found 
in 
all 
but 
1 
child. 
Of 
the 
46 
Ob 
children 
with 
FLD, 
42 
children 
(91.3%) 
had 
polysomnographic 
evidence 
of 
OSA 
(Table 
3). 
In 
addition, 
I/G 
ratios 
of 


. 
0.30 
were 
present 
in 
26 
children 
with 
FLD 
(56.5%). 
In 
contrast, 
OSA 
was 
present 
in 
only 
69 
of 
the 
96 
Ob 
children 
without 
elevated 
LFT 
levels 
(71.8%), 
and 
elevated

occurred

Discussion 


This 
study 
shows 
that 
FLD 
is 
highly 
prevalent 
among 
Ob 
habitually 
snoring 
children. 
Furthermore, 


there 
is 
a 
more 
than 
threefold 
increase 
in 
the 
relative 
risk 
for 
FLD 
in 
the 
present 
cohort 
compared 
to 
previously 
reported 
FLD 
rates 
among 
Ob 
adolescents 
in 
the 
United 
States,6 
suggesting 
that 
respiratory 
disturbances 
during 
sleep 
may 
contribute 
to 
the 
underlying 
mechanisms 
of 
hepatic 
steatosis 
in 
the 
context 
of 
obesity. 
Furthermore, 
we 
not 
only 
confirm 
previous 
observations 
on 
the 
increased 
frequency 
of 
insulin 
resistance 
and 
altered 
circulating 
lipid 
levels 
among 
children 
with 
FLD,28 
but 
also 
show 
that 
OSA 
is 
extremely 
frequent 
and 
more 
prevalent 
among 
Ob 
snoring 
children 
with 
elevated 
ALT 
levels 
compared 
with 
Ob 
snoring 
children 
without 
FLD. 
Finally, 
our 
study 
suggests 
that 
the 
effective 
treatment 
of 
OSA 
results 
in 
significant 
improvements 
in 
ALT 
abnormalities 
in 
a 
substantial 
proportion 
of 
children 
with 
FLD. 


Before 
we 
further 
discuss 
the 
potential 
implications 
of 
current 
findings, 
some 
methodological 
issues 
deserve 
comment. 
Our 
cohort 
was 
based 
on 
a 
convenience 
sample 
of 
otherwise 
healthy 
children 
who 
were 
being 
evaluated 
for 
the 
presence 
of 
habitual 
snoring. 
Thus, 
we 
cannot 
provide 
accurate 
estimates 
of 
the 
true 
prevalence 
of 
FLD 
in 
Ob 
children, 
and 
estimates 
of 
the 
relative 
risk 
for 
FLD 
in 
our 
population 
would 
have 
to 
rely 
on 
previously 
published 
data.6 
Considering 
the 
FLD 
prevalence 
of 
3% 
as 
previously 
reported 
in 
Ob 
children,6 
the 
relative 
risk 
for 
FLD 
among 
our 
present 
cohort 
of 
Ob 
habitually 
snoring 
children 
would 
have 
been 
significantly 
increased 
(OR, 
4.31; 
95% 
CI, 
1.96 
to 
9.73; 
p 
. 
0.00005). 
Second, 
although 
we 
conducted 
an 
evaluation 
aiming 
to 
exclude 
other 
causes 
of 
elevated 
liver 
enzyme 
levels 
in 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
subjects 
with 
increased 
ALT 
levels, 
none 
of 
these 
children 
underwent 
liver 
biopsy 
to 
specifically 
define 
the 
histopathologic 
abnormalities 
associated 
with 
the 
biochemical 
alterations 
identified 
herein. 
While 
such 
an 
invasive 
procedure 
would 
undoubtedly 
be 
considered 
unnecessary 
for 
clinical 
purposes 
and 
would 
pose 
unnecessary 
and 
excessive 
risk, 
the 
information 
obtained 
might 
have 
added 
further 
insights 
into 
the 
process 
of 
FLD 
in 
early 
childhood. 
Nevertheless, 
the 
reversal 
of 
the 
elevated 
transaminase 
levels 
in 
the 
vast 
majority 
of 
children 
with 
putative 
FLD

implementation

effective 
treatment

the 
underlying 
OSA 
is 
highly 
supportive 
of 
a 
link 
among 
obesity, 
OSA, 
and 
increased 
LFT 
levels. 


To 
date, 
the 
pathophysiologic 
mechanisms 
underlying 
FLD 
remain 
incompletely 
understood. 
It 
has 
become 
apparent 
that 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
initial 
steatosis, 
a 
second 
injurious 
process 
involving 
insulin 
resistance, 
reduced 
adiponectin 
responses,29,30 
increased 
cytokine 
activity, 
oxidative 
stress, 
and/or 
mitochondrial 
dysfunction 
are 
necessary 
for 
the 
pathogenesis 
of 
nonalcoholic 
steatohepatitis.31–34 
Conversely, 
genetically 
and 
environmentally 
modified 
antioxidant 
responses 
and 
other 
individual 
susceptibility 
factors 
may 
also 
modulate 
the 
frequency 
and 
severity 
of 
FLD, 
even 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
similar 
adiposity 
loads.34–37 
As 
further 
evidence 
of 
the 
presence 
of 
genetic 
determinants 
of 
susceptibility 
to 
FLD, 
we 
found 
a 
reduced 
frequency 
of 
FLD 
among 
African-American 
children, 
which 
is 
similar 
to 
the 
findings 
of 
a 
previously 
published 
report.38 


The 
remarkable 
analogy 
between 
the 
putative 
pathophysiologic 
mechanisms 
of 
FLD 
and 
those 
ascribed 
to 
end-organ 
injury 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
OSA, 
suggest 
that 
the 
coexistence 
of 
OSA 
and 
obesity 
could 
be 
the 
determining 
factor 
underlying 
earlier 
and 
potentially 
more 
severe 
FLD 
in 
young 
children. 
To 
further 
illustrate 
the 
similarity 
of 
the 
mechanisms 
underlying 
FLD 
and 
OSA-induced 
end-organ 
injury, 
a 
brief 
review 
of 
such 
mechanisms 
in 
the 
context 
of 
OSA 
is 
necessary. 
For 
example, 
increased 
thiobarbituric 
acid-reactive 
substance 
formation 
has 
been 
repeatedly 
reported39–41 
in 
patients 
with 
severe 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
(SDB) 
compared 
to 
healthy 
subjects; 
the 
treatment 
of 
OSA 
will 
improve 
the 
abnormal 
lipid 
peroxidation 
events, 
and 
the 
presence 
of 
increased 
oxidized 
low-density 
lipoprotein 
levels 
has 
also 
been 
noted 
in 
OSA 
patients.42,43 


In 
support 
of 
a 
systemic 
inflammatory 
response 
to 
OSA, 
Schultz 
and 
colleagues44 
reported 
markedly 
enhanced 
release 
of 
superoxide 
from 
stimulated 
polymorphonuclear 
neutrophils 
compared 
to 
control 
subjects, 
and 
further 
showed 
that 
CPAP 
therapy 
resulted 
in 
decreased 
superoxide 
release. 
Tumor 
necrosis 
factor 
(TNF)-. 
levels 
are 
increased, 
and 
correlate 
with 
the 
degree 
of 
sleepiness 
and 
the 
severity 
of 
hypoxia 
in 
adult 
patients 
with 
OSA.14 
We 
have 
reported45 
very 
similar 
findings 
in 
children 
with 
SDB, 
whereby 
TNF-. 
serum 
levels 
were 
not 
only 
elevated 
in 
a 
significant 
proportion 
of 
children 
with 
polysomnographic 
evidence 
of 
OSA, 
but 
also 
that 
the 
magnitude 
of 
TNF-. 
levels 
correlated 
with 
the 
degree 
of 
respiratory 
event-induced 
sleep 
fragmentation 
as 
well 
as 
with 
the 
presence 
of 
obesity.45 


C-reactive 
protein 
(CRP) 
is 
an 
important 
circulating 
marker 
of 
inflammation 
and 
is 
produced 
in 
the 
liver 
through 
interleukin-6 
activity. 
Elevations 
in 
CRP 
levels 
have 
been 
rather 
consistently 
reported 
both 
in 
adults46,47 
and 
in 
children12,48 
with 
OSA, 
and 


CRP 
levels 
are 
reduced 
with 
effective 
treatment.13,46 
Of 
interest, 
the 
presence 
of 
concurrent 
obesity 
was 
a 
major 
determinant 
of 
the 
variance 
in 
CRP 
responses. 
In 
fact, 
the 
interactions 
among 
the 
severity 
of 
SDB, 
lifestyle, 
and 
environmental 
conditions, 
and 
genetically 
derived 
individual 
susceptibility 
have 
now 
been 
proposed 
as 
the 
major 
potential 
players 
involved 
in 
the 
magnitude 
of 
the 
oxidative 
stress 
and 
inflammatory 
responses 
associated 
with 
SDB.11,49 
Taken 
together, 
the 
increased 
risk 
for 
OSA 
in 
Ob 
persons10 
and 
the 
overall 
presumptive 
inflammatory 
and 
oxidative 
burden 
accrual 
derived 
from 
the 
emergence 
of 
OSA 
in 
the 
context 
of 
obesity 
appear 
to 
interact 
to 
increase 
the 
probability 
of 
FLD. 
As 
a 
corollary 
to 
this 
assumption, 
the 
overall 
risk 
for 
OSA 
was 
increased 
among 
Ob 
children, 
in 
whom 
the 
risk 
of 
OSA 
was 
significantly 
higher 
among 
those 
who 
had 
elevated 
ALT 
levels. 


In 
general, 
Ob 
children, 
and 
more 
particularly 
those 
with 
FLD, 
were 
at 
risk 
for 
insulin 
resistance 
and 
altered 
serum 
lipid 
profiles. 
However, 
we 
have 
previously 
shown 
that 
obesity 
rather 
than 
OSA 
appears 
to 
be 
the 
major 
driving 
factor 
for 
metabolic 
dysfunction 
in 
the 
pediatric 
population.25 
Based 
on 
current 
findings, 
we 
now 
propose 
that 
the 
metabolic 
alterations 
initiated 
by 
the 
presence 
of 
obesity 
will 
either 
independently 
or 
collaboratively 
with 
OSA 
contribute 
to 
the 
emergence 
of 
FLD. 


In 
summary, 
the 
risk 
of 
FLD 
is 
markedly 
increased 
by 
the 
coexistence 
of 
OSA 
in 
habitually 
snoring 
Ob 
children, 
and 
effective 
treatment 
of 
OSA 
is 
associated 
with 
significant 
improvements 
in 
liver 
enzyme 
levels 
in 
the 
vast 
majority 
of 
these 
patients. 
Considering 
the 
high 
risk 
for 
both 
FLD 
and 
OSA 
in 
the 
context 
of 
obesity 
during 
childhood, 
it 
is 
likely 
that 
these 
two 
conditions 
may 
be 
pathophysiologically 
linked. 
Based 
on 
the 
current 
findings, 
we 
believe 
that 
routine 
assessment 
with 
liver 
function 
tests 
in 
Ob 
children 
with 
OSA 
may 
identify 
a 
particularly 
susceptible 
group 
of 
patients 
who 
may 
benefit 
from 
careful 
evaluation 
and 
treatment 
by 
the 
coordinated 
efforts 
of 
pediatric 
gastroenterologists 
and 
sleep 
practitioners.
