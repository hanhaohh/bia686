ABSTRACT. Objective. To determine whether children 
with a clinical assessment suggestive of obstructive 
sleep apnea (OSA) but with negative polysomnography 
(PSG) have improvement in their clinical assessment 
score after tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy (T&A) as 
compared with similar children who do not undergo 
surgery. 

Methods. In a prospective, randomized, investigator-
blinded, controlled trial, 59 otherwise healthy children 
(mean age: 6.3 years [3.0]; 31 boys, 28 girls) with a clinical 
diagnosis of OSA (clinical assessment score >40) were 
recruited from the pediatric otolaryngology and pediatric 
pulmonary private offices and clinics of a tertiary care, 
academic medical center. A standardized assessment was 
performed on all patients, including history, physical 
examination, voice recording, tape recording of breathing 
during sleep, lateral neck radiograph, echocardiogram, 
and PSG. A clinical assessment score was assigned. Children 
with positive PSG (n . 
27) were scheduled for T&A, 
whereas children with negative PSG (n . 
29) were randomized 
to T&A (n . 
15) or no surgery (n . 
14). Children 
were reassessed in an identical manner at a planned 
6-month follow-up. 

Results. Follow-up was available for 21 patients with 
positive PSG, 11 patients with negative PSG randomized 
to T&A, and 9 nonsurgery patients. In the randomized 
subjects, the median reduction in clinical assessment 
score was 49 (range: 32–61) for the T&A patients as compared 
with 8 (range: 9 to 29) for the nonsurgery patients. 
Nine (82%) of the T&A patients were asymptomatic 
(clinical assessment score <20) compared with 2 
(22%) of the nonsurgery patients. 

Conclusion. Children with a positive clinical assessment 
of OSA but negative PSG have significant improvement 
after T&A as compared with observation alone, 
thus validating the clinician’s role in diagnosing upper 
airway obstruction. Pediatrics 2004;114:33–43; obstructive

bstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was first described 
in children in the medical literature 
by Guilleminault et al1 in 1975. They and 
subsequent investigators described the clinical features 
found in children with overnight polysomnography 
(PSG) positive for OSA. The prevalence of 
pediatric OSA has been estimated to be between 1% 
and 3% in preschool and school-aged children.2 Additional 
work in pediatric sleep disorders has shown 
that sleep-disordered breathing is a continuum of 
severity from partial obstruction of the upper airway, 
producing snoring, to increased upper airway 
resistance syndrome (UARS) to continuous episodes 
of complete upper airway obstruction or OSA.3 Tonsillectomy 
and adenoidectomy (T&A) is successful in 
eliminating obstruction in 85% to 95% of otherwise 
normal children with OSA.4,5 

Although the clinical effects of OSA in children 
have been well described, reports have documented 
the inaccuracy of predicting which children with 
histories and physical examinations suggestive of 
OSA will have positive PSG. In 7 trials, the accuracy 
of clinical evaluation of pediatric OSA in predicting 
positive sleep studies was poor, ranging from 30% to 
85%.5–11 On the basis of the published studies and 
because only 20% to 30% of snoring children have 
positive PSG, the 1996 American Thoracic Society 
Consensus Committee recommended that PSG be 
obtained before T&A to differentiate primary snoring 
from OSA.12 Although the published studies suggest 
that clinical evaluation is inaccurate in diagnosing 
OSA in children, most of the studies used adult 
criteria for interpretation of the sleep studies, which 
are now recognized to be inappropriate for children. 
In addition, none of the studies considered the diagnosis 
of UARS in the evaluations, which requires 
esophageal pressure monitoring and is not routine in 
most centers. Therefore, it is likely that the number of 
children with significant sleep-disordered breathing 
was underestimated in these studies, as was the 
value of clinical assessment.13

OSA but negative PSG are a treatment dilemma. PSG 
has been considered the “gold standard” diagnostic 
tool to determine which children with symptoms of 
upper airway obstruction would benefit from T&A,12 
yet numerous previous reports have shown that 
children’s symptoms of upper airway obstruction 
improve after T&A regardless of whether apnea is 
documented by PSG.5,14–18 Reports have also documented 
improvement in children’s behavior and 
quality of life.19–22 

Our objective was to determine whether otherwise 
healthy children with a positive clinical assessment 
of significant upper airway obstruction but with PSG 
negative for OSA have improvement in their clinical 
assessment score after T&A as compared with children 
who do not undergo surgery. If children with a 
clinical assessment of pediatric OSA but with negative 
PSG do not improve with observation alone, 
then we will validate the clinician’s role in diagnosing 
significant upper airway obstruction. 

METHODS 

Participants 

Fifty-nine children with a clinical diagnosis of OSA were evaluated 
prospectively by a standardized history, physical examination, 
voice recording, review of a tape recording of breathing 
during sleep, lateral neck radiograph to assess adenoid size, and 
echocardiogram to evaluate for pulmonary hypertension. A clinical 
assessment score was assigned to each child. PSG was then 
used as the gold reference standard to determine the presence or 
absence of sleep apnea. Children with a positive PSG (PSG) 
underwent T&A. Children with a negative PSG were randomized 
to undergo T&A (PSG. 
T&A) or no surgery (PSG. 
nonsurgery). 
It was planned that children would be reassessed in an identical 
manner 6 months later. 

Children who were between 2 and 14 years of age and were 
suspected of having sleep-disordered breathing were recruited 
from the pediatric otolaryngology private office and clinic at the 
University Hospital of Brooklyn, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, 
and the otolaryngology and pediatric pulmonary clinics at the 
Kings County Hospital Center in Brooklyn, NY, from March 1999 
through May 2001. Children were referred to the specialty offices 
by their primary care physicians for evaluation of snoring and 
nighttime breathing difficulties. All children were evaluated by 
the principal investigator and were required to have a clinical

assessment score 40 to be included in the study (Table 1). Children 
with recognized craniofacial syndromes, neuromuscular disorders, 
or known cranial nerve palsies were excluded. The protocol 
was approved by the SUNY Downstate Medical Center 
Institutional Review Board, informed consent was obtained from 
the parents, and a consecutive sample was recruited. 

Interventions 

A standardized history and physical examination were performed. 
The history evaluated the frequency (every night, 4 –6 
nights per week, 1–3 nights per week, never) of symptoms of 
nighttime upper airway obstruction, daytime effects, and symptoms 
associated with hypertrophy of Waldeyer’s ring (Table 1). 
The duration of apneic pauses was recorded as 15 seconds, 5 to 
15 seconds, 5 seconds, and none. School/daytime performance 
was recorded as poor (left back or failed 1 subject), below average 
(C/D), average (B/C), and above average (A/B). Recurrent tonsillitis 
was recorded as 6 to 10 episodes per year, 4 to 5 episodes 
per year, 2 to 3 episodes per year, and 0 to 1 episode per year. An 
episode of tonsillitis required a physician visit and treatment with 
an antibiotic. 

The physical examination included the patient’s height, weight, 
blood pressure, presence or absence of mouthbreathing and hyponasality, 
degree of adenoid facies (open mouth, long face, mandibular 
hypoplasia scored as severe, mild, absent), tonsil size, and 
the ability to fog a mirror with nasal breathing (none, poor, fair, 
well). Body mass index (BMI) was calculated by dividing the 
child’s weight in kilograms by the square of the height in meters. 
Hyponasality was scored as present or absent by review of a 2-to 
5-minute audiotape recording of patient conversation by a speech 
pathologist who was blinded to patient group. Tonsil size was 
graded as the reduction in pharyngeal luminal diameter: 1,0% 
to 25%; 2, 26% to 50%; 3, 51% to 75%; and 4, 76% to 100% as 
described by Brodsky.23 

An audiotape recording of the child’s breathing while asleep 
(sleep tape) was performed during the PSG by the technician, who 
was instructed to record the child’s breathing at its worst. At least 
20 minutes of the tape was evaluated by the principal investigator 
and scored as no apnea, snoring without apneic pauses (pauses in 
breathing of at least 5 seconds) or a struggling sound; moderate 
apnea, snoring with 5-to 10-second apneic pauses or a struggling 
sound; or severe apnea, snoring with 10-second apneic pauses 
and a struggling sound. 

The lateral neck radiographs and echocardiograms were obtained 
by standard techniques. The lateral neck radiograph was 
graded according to the degree of adenoid hypertrophy: normal 
adenoid pad, mild adenoid hypertrophy, moderate adenoid hypertrophy, 
and severe adenoid hypertrophy. The presence or absence 
of pulmonary hypertension was assessed on the echocardiogram 
by estimating the pulmonary artery systolic pressure from 
the tricuspid regurgitation jet using the Bernoulli equation. The 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure was considered abnormal 
when it was 30 mm Hg.24 The lateral neck radiographs and 
echocardiograms were interpreted by clinicians who were blinded 
to patient group. 

Clinical Assessment Score 

Each child was assigned a clinical assessment score (Table 1). 
Symptoms highly suggestive of OSA (pauses, gasping, sleeping 
with neck extended, daytime sleepiness) contributed more than 
those that were nonspecific (morning headache, poor school performance, 
rhinorrhea). The more frequent the symptom, the 
higher the score. Enuresis was scored only for children aged 4 and 
above. A score of 2 was given to all children younger than 4. 
Similarly, height, BMI, and blood pressure were compared with 
standard percentiles for age and gender, and those at the extremes 
contributed more than those closer to the norm.25,26 The more 
severe the adenotonsillar hypertrophy seen on physical examina-

tion or demonstrated by the lateral neck radiograph, the higher 
the score. A high sleep tape score or an echocardiogram demonstrating 
pulmonary hypertension contributed heavily to the clinical 
assessment score. In addition to the overall score, each child 
received a separate score for symptoms, sleep tape, and echocardiogram 
(score A; Table 1) and physical examination and lateral 
neck radiograph (score B; Table 1). Surgical removal of the tonsils 
and adenoids automatically lowered score B in the surgical patients, 
whereas improvement in score A reflected only clinical 
improvement. 

Although the clinical assessment score has not been previously 
validated against PSG, the overall score was developed from the 
clinical assessment used in the first author’s previous prospective 
study of the clinical assessment of pediatric OSA.7 Clinical features 
were weighted more or less heavily depending on the factor’s 
association with OSA according to the statistical analysis 
performed during the previous data review. The current score also 
included an assessment of hyponasality as a measure of adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy27 and an objective measurement of adenoid 
size from the lateral neck film. The highest possible score was 164. 
Children with a score 40 were considered to have OSA, children 
with a score 20 but 40 were considered to have moderate 
symptoms of upper airway obstruction but not apnea, and children 
with a score 20 were considered to be asymptomatic. These 
subdivisions were based on the collective opinion of 2 pediatric 
otolaryngologists (Dr Goldstein and Dr Post) and a pediatric 
pulmonologist as well as review of the published studies. 

Interobserver Reliability 

Clinical assessments were performed by the principal investigator 
for every child. Additional assessments were performed by 
1 or 2 independent examiners, a pediatric pulmonary fellow, and 
an otolaryngology resident for 25 patients. The additional assessments 
were limited to the 25 items scored by the examining 
physician and not independent evaluators (hyponasality, sleep 
tape, lateral neck radiograph, echocardiogram) or the nursing staff 
(height, weight, blood pressure). The initial assessments were 
performed before the PSG. The follow-up assessments were performed 
by the investigators who were blinded to whether the 
child had had surgery. Evaluation of tonsil size was performed as 
the last part of the physical examination after the remainder of the 
clinical assessment had been recorded. For determining interrater 
reliability for coding the presence or absence of hyponasality, 20 
conversational samples were randomly selected and rated by a 
second examiner, who was blinded to the treatment status of the 
child. Subject-to-subject agreement for the presence or absence of 
hyponasality between the 2 raters was .90 (18 of 20). 

PSG 

PSG was performed at the SUNY Downstate Pediatric Pulmonary 
Function, Exercise, and Sleep Physiology Laboratories and 
consisted of respiratory rate, pulse rate, pulse oximetry, inductive 
plethysmography of the chest and abdomen and the mathematical 
sum of the 2 for respiratory effort, and oronasal airflow from a 
loose mask or oral and nasal thermistors. Obstructive apnea was 
defined as the cessation of oronasal airflow with continued respiratory 
effort for at least 2.5 times the typical breath interval, and 
obstructive hypopnea was defined as a decrease in amplitude of 
oronasal airflow of at least 50% with no decrease in respiratory 
effort for the same duration. PSG was considered positive for OSA 
when the number of obstructive apneas plus hypopneas per hour 
of sleep (respiratory disturbance index [RDI]) was at least 5 or at 
least 10% of the night was spent with oxygen saturation 90%. 
The 6-month follow-up PSG was analyzed by a pulmonologist 
who was blinded to whether the patient had had surgery. 

Randomization 

Randomization was performed by using a computerized list 
generated by the biostatistician in blocks of 2 to ensure equal size 
treatment groups. T&A was performed at the University Hospital 
of Brooklyn or the Kings County Hospital Center by a pediatric 
otolaryngologist who was not 1 of the investigators. 

Sample Size Estimation 

Because clinical assessment of OSA has been shown to have a 
positive predictive value of 50%,7 we predicted that half of the 

36 CLINICAL ASSESSMENT OF PEDIATRIC OSA 

patients enrolled would have positive PSG. Because T&A relieves 
symptoms of upper airway obstruction, we expected that 10% of 
the PSG. 
T&A children would remain symptomatic at the 
6-month follow-up (overall clinical assessment score 20) and that 
90% would be asymptomatic (overall clinical assessment score 

20). We estimated that 80% of children who had negative PSG 
and did not undergo surgery would remain symptomatic at the 
6-month follow-up and that 20% would be asymptomatic. Assuming 
. 
of .05 and power of .9, we estimated that we would need a 
total of 22 children with negative PSG to find a significant difference 
between the patients who had negative PSG and underwent 
T&A and those who did not. Of the 22 with negative PSG, 11 
would be randomized to the surgery group and 11 to the no 
surgery group. Therefore, we needed a total of 44 patients for 22 
to have negative PSG. Assuming that 10 (23%) patients would 
drop out, a total of 54 children were initially recruited. When the 
dropout rate after the recruitment of the initial 54 children was 
31%, an additional 5 patients were recruited to help achieve an 
adequate sample size. 
Statistical Methods 

The initial clinical assessment scores and change in clinical 
assessment scores were compared between the PSG. 
T&A and 
PSG. 
nonsurgery groups using the Wilcoxon rank sum test; the 
initial and final PSG parameters between the PSG. 
T&A and 
PSG. 
nonsurgery groups were also compared using the Wilcoxon 
test. The proportion of patients with final clinical assessment score 
20 and 40 in the PSG. 
T&A and PSG. 
nonsurgery groups 
were compared using Fisher exact test. Comparisons of age and 
length of follow-up between the PSG. 
T&A and PSG. 
nonsurgery 
groups were performed using the Wilcoxon test; comparison 
of the gender and race distributions were compared using Fisher 
exact test. Interrater agreement for the clinical assessment score 
was measured by intraclass correlations using 2-way random 
effects models. A mixed linear model was used to test for differences 
among observers in mean clinical assessment scores. The 
positive predictive value of the total clinical assessment score in 
predicting a positive PSG was calculated. The sensitivity, specificity, 
and positive and negative predictive values of the sleep tape 
score in predicting a positive PSG were calculated, and Fisher 
exact test was used to determine their significance. A subset of 
items from the clinical assessment score (snoring, pauses, gasping, 
neck extension, daytime sleepiness, adenoid facies, sleep tape) 
were analyzed by logistic regression to determine the utility of the 
items in predicting a positive PSG. The area under the receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used as a measure of 
predictive utility for logistic regression analysis. P . 
.05 was 
considered statistically significant. SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) 
software was used for data analysis. 

RESULTS 

The flow of participants through the study protocol 
is presented in Fig 1. Of the 59 children who 
entered the study, 3 would not sleep in the laboratory, 
so a PSG could not be obtained. Of the 56 
children who underwent PSG, 27 (48%) had positive 
PSG and 29 (52%) had negative PSG. Of the 29 children 
with negative PSG, 15 were randomized to T&A 
and 14 were randomized to no surgery. The parents 
of 3 children in the PSG. 
group and the parents of 2 
children in the PSG. 
T&A group refused surgery. A 
high rate of attrition occurred during the study period 
as 13 (23%) of 56 were lost to follow-up before 
the final study visit. Of the 13, 8 had moved and were 
unable to be contacted, and 5 refused to bring the 
child back usually stating time constraints. One child 
in the PSG. 
group was excluded because his parents 
refused T&A, although he did have follow-up. One 
child in the PSG. 
nonsurgery group had an adenoidectomy 
alone because of parental concern and 
was withdrawn from the study.

The mean age of the children who completed the 
protocol was between 5.8 (2.6) and 7.0 (3.6) years, 
depending on patient group. There were almost 
equal numbers of boys and girls in the study population, 
although more girls with negative PSG were 
randomized to surgery and more boys with negative 
PSG were randomized to no surgery. The patient 
population was predominantly black, which reflects 
the racial composition of central Brooklyn. Mean 
follow-up after initial evaluation and after T&A is 
presented in Table 3. There was no significant difference 
in age, gender distribution, racial distribution,

nonsurgery patient who had a positive PSG at 
follow-up was 71. An intent-to-treat analysis was not 
performed because all but 1 of the children who did 
not receive their assigned treatment allocation were 
lost to follow-up. 

Initial and final mean and median scores for all of 
the individual items of the clinical assessment score 
are presented in Table 6. On initial evaluation, BMI 

95th percentile was found in 14 (34%) children: 9 in

BMI of all 3 children with positive PSG at final evaluation

for only 2 (5%) children at both initial and final 
evaluations: 1 in the PSG. 
T&A group and 1 in the

Systemic hypertension was found in a total of 8 
(20%) children initially: 6 in the PSG. 
group, 1 in the 
PSG. 
T&A group, and 1 in the PSG. 
nonsurgery 
group. It was 95th percentile in 4 children and 
between the 90th and 95th percentile in 4 children. 

Three of these children also had a BMI 95th percentile. 
The hypertension had resolved by follow-up 
evaluation in all children, but 3 (7%) additional children 
(all in the initial PSG. 
group) developed systemic 
hypertension. It was 95th percentile in 1 patient 
and between the 90th and 95th in the other 2 
children. All 3 children had negative PSG at final 
evaluation, although 2 had a BMI 95th percentile. 

Only 1 child had an echocardiogram suggestive of 
pulmonary hypertension. The child, in the PSG. 
group, had a peak velocity of tricuspid regurgitation 
jet of 24 to 36 mm Hg, estimating right ventricular 
pressures of 29 to 41 mm Hg on his initial echocardiogram. 
The estimated pressure gradient was 19.4 
mm Hg, estimating normal right ventricular pressures 
on his follow-up echocardiogram, and his follow-
up sleep study was normal. 

The positive predictive value of the initial total 
clinical assessment score for predicting a positive 
PSG was 48% (27 of 56). Of the 27 children with 
positive PSG at their initial evaluation, 10 had sleep 
tapes scored as severe apnea, 13 had sleep tapes 
scored as moderate apnea, 3 had sleep tapes negative 
for apnea, and 1 did not have a sleep tape. Of the 15 
children in the PSG.

group, initial sleep tapes were scored as severe apnea 
in 1 child, moderate apnea in 4 children, and negative 
for apnea in 9 children. Thus, the sleep tape had 
a sensitivity of 88% (23 of 26), a specificity of 52% (15 
of 29), a positive predictive value of 62% (23 of 37), 
and a negative predictive value of 83% (15 of 18) in 
predicting a positive PSG (Phi coefficient . 
.43, P . 
.002, Fisher exact test). Of the 3 children with positive 
PSG at the final evaluation, 1 had a sleep tape scored 
as severe apnea (initial PSG. 
group), 1 had a sleep 
tape scored as moderate apnea (PSG. 
nonsurgery 
group), and 1 had a sleep tape negative for apnea 
(initial PSG. 
group). Of the 38 patients with negative 
PSG at final evaluation, 3 had sleep tapes scored 
as moderate apnea (all in the PSG. 
nonsurgery 
group), and 35 had sleep tapes scored as negative for 
apnea. 

Logistic regression using 7 items from the clinical 
assessment score (snoring, pauses, gasping, neck extension, 
daytime sleepiness, adenoid facies, and 
sleep tape) as predictors was conducted. Only sleep 
tape was a significant predictor (P . 
.009); the area 
under the ROC curve was .84. A simpler model 
containing only the sleep tape predictor was not 
significantly inferior to the full model (likelihood 
ratio test P . 
.090); area under the ROC curve for this 
reduced model was .75. In other words, although the 
sleep tape was a moderately useful predictor, the 
addition of the other items did not significantly increase 
the predictive utility. 

Of the 37 children who underwent T&A, the only 
major complication was a right thigh burn to 1 child 
in the initial PSG. 
group secondary to improper 
application of the grounding of the electrocautery 
unit. The wound healed with dressing changes, but 
the child was hospitalized for 3 days. Children were 
observed in the hospital for a mean of 21 (12) hours 
after surgery. Children in the PSG. 
T&A group who 
were at least 3 years of age were usually discharged 
from the hospital 6 hours after surgery, whereas the 
children in the PSG. 
group were admitted for pulse 
oximetry observation for 1 night unless the PSG was 
considered mild enough to warrant a 6-hour stay. 
Children were observed either on the floor or in a 
monitored unit at the discretion of the attending 
surgeon. There were no postoperative respiratory 
complications, episodes of postoperative hemorrhage, 
or readmissions to the hospital. 

DISCUSSION 

PSG has been recommended to differentiate children 
with primary snoring from children with OSA. 
Children with primary snoring do not have other 
nighttime and daytime symptoms and have normal 
sleep studies. Primary snoring is considered to be a 
benign condition that will resolve in 50% of children 
over time.28 Snoring has been shown to progress to 
mild OSA in only 10% of cases.29 Children with 
negative PSG have not been considered to be surgical 
candidates for treatment of upper airway obstruction 
even when they have symptoms related to enlarged 
tonsils and adenoids. 

Our results demonstrate that the signs and symptoms 
of OSA improve after T&A regardless of 

whether OSA is documented by PSG. At follow-up, 
the children in the PSG. 
T&A group had significant 
improvement in the total clinical assessment score as 
well as the subset scores as compared with children 
in the PSG. 
nonsurgery group. The subset scores 
were designed to separate the items that would automatically 
be decreased after T&A (tonsil size and 
adenoid size on the lateral neck radiograph, score B) 
from the items that would solely reflect clinical improvement 
(score A). Eighty-two percent of the 
PSG. 
T&A group were asymptomatic at follow-up 
as compared with 22% of the PSG. 
nonsurgery patients, 
resulting in a statistically significant difference 
between the groups. Our findings were close to the 
assumptions in our sample size estimation, which 
predicted that 90% of the PSG. 
T&A children and 
20% of the PSG. 
nonsurgery children would be 
asymptomatic at follow-up. There was also a significant 
difference between the groups in children who 
were moderately symptomatic (clinical assessment 
score 20 but 40) at final evaluation. One (11%) 
child in the PSG. 
nonsurgery group developed OSA 
at follow-up, a finding that is comparable to the 10% 
reported rate of the progression of primary snoring 
to OSA. 

A weakness of our findings is that despite randomization 
at study outset, the PSG. 
nonsurgery 
group had a significantly lower initial total clinical 
assessment score than the PSG. 
T&A group. The 
difference resulted from findings on the physical 
examination (score B) as opposed to differences in 
symptoms (score A) and occurred because of the 
small sample size of our patient population. To correct 
for the differences in initial clinical assessment 
scores, we compared changes in clinical assessment 
scores between the 2 groups at the final evaluation. 

The clinical assessment score may prove to be a 
useful tool for the office diagnosis of pediatric OSA. 
Additional study to validate the score against PSG 
and other external measures such as quality-of-life 
instruments is needed. Its responsiveness to longitudinal 
change must also be evaluated further. Our 
study demonstrated a significant difference in 
change scores between the PSG. 
T&A and PSG. 
nonsurgery groups using a score of 40 as the requirement 
for entry, but there also may be a role for 
treatment of children with scores 20 but 40. 

Although we demonstrated significant improvement 
in clinical scores, are these changes clinically 
relevant? Snoring was only 1 of 20 nighttime and 
daytime symptoms that brought these children to 
medical attention. Entry into the study required a 
clinical assessment that revealed more than just snoring. 
Symptoms of upper airway obstruction have 
been shown to have a significant impact on children’s 
quality of life. De Serres et al19 administered 
the Obstructive Sleep Disorders-6 Survey, a validated

sleep studies. Domains of the survey most affected at 
initial evaluation were physical suffering, sleep disturbance, 
and caregiver concern. Postoperatively, 
90% of children had improvement in quality of life, 
which was considered large in 75% and moderate in 
6%. 

Goldstein et al20 administered another validated 
quality-of-life survey, the OSA-18, along with a standardized 
measure of children’s behavior, the Child 
Behavior Checklist, to the caregivers of 64 children 
before T&A and 3 months postoperatively. Surgery 
was performed for the treatment of upper airway 
obstruction in 84% of children, 92% of whom received 
a diagnosis on a clinical basis as only 8% had 
preoperative PSG. Postoperatively, a large change in 
quality of life was found for the OSA-18 domains of 
sleep disturbance, caregiver concerns, and physical 
symptoms, and a moderate change was found for 
emotional symptoms and daytime function. As in the 
study by de Serres et al,19 the change in the impact of 
sleep-disordered breathing on quality of life was 
highly significant after T&A. The study also found 
significant improvement in behavioral and emotional 
difficulties after T&A as measured by the 
Child Behavior Checklist Total Problem Score and 
the individual scales of Withdrawn, Somatic Complaints, 
Anxious/Depressed, Thought Problems, Attention 
Problems, Delinquent Behavior, Aggressive 
Behavior, Sleep Problems, and Destructive Behavior. 

As in the other studies of the accuracy of clinical 
diagnosis in predicting a positive PSG, esophageal 
pressure monitoring for detecting UARS was not 
performed. Children with UARS demonstrate abnormally 
increased upper airway resistance, resulting in 
increased respiratory effort and sleep fragmentation 
without apneic or hypopneic episodes or desaturation. 
The clinical effects of UARS are identical to OSA 
and treatment is the same.30 The children with negative 
PSG in our study may have been experiencing 
UARS, with the resulting resolution of signs and 
symptoms in those who underwent T&A. Because 
the measurement of UARS is not routine in most 
centers, children with sleep-disordered breathing are 
often missed by standard PSG.13 Clinical assessment 
remains a valuable tool in assessing upper airway 
obstruction and sleep-disordered breathing and determining 
the need for T&A. 

Our accuracy of predicting a positive PSG in children 
with a clinical assessment suggestive of OSA 
(48%) when UARS is not evaluated agrees with the 
findings of previous studies of pediatric OSA.5–11 
Our definition of a positive PSG was an RDI 5. 
Many sleep laboratories consider an AI 1tobe 
abnormal, based on studies of normal children.31 If 
we considered children with an AI 1 to have abnormal 
PSG, then 6 of the 15 PSG. 
T&A children 
and 5 of the14 PSG. 
nonsurgery children would 
have had initial positive sleep studies, increasing our 
clinical accuracy to 68%. However, 13 (41%) of the 32 
children who underwent T&A would have had positive 
PSG at final evaluation, which is much higher 
than the published reports. Because most of the children 
were asymptomatic at final evaluation, an AI 

1 seems too strict a definition for a positive PSG. 
Using the RDI 5 as the definition of a positive PSG, 
10% of the children with initial PSG positive for OSA 
had final PSG still positive for apnea. This finding 
agrees with previous studies that report that T&A is 
curative in 85% to 95% of otherwise healthy children.
4,5 

Using a logistic regression model, only sleep tape 
was a moderately useful predictor of a positive PSG. 
The addition of 6 items from the clinical assessment 
did not increase the predictive utility of the model. 
Previous studies have also demonstrated that scores 
that were based on a subset of items from the clinical 
assessment were not sufficiently predictive to determine 
which children would have a positive 

PSG.6,7,11,32 

The sleep tape had a sensitivity of 88%, a specificity 
of 52%, and a positive predictive value of 62% in 
predicting a positive PSG. These results are similar to 
those of Lamm et al,33 who found that an audiotape 
had a median sensitivity of 71% and median specificity 
of 80% in predicting a positive PSG in 29 children 
who were referred to a sleep laboratory for 
evaluation of sleep-disordered breathing. Although 
not specific enough to distinguish children with positive 
and negative studies, the sleep tape is an inexpensive, 
convenient method to confirm the parents’ 
description of the child’s nighttime breathing difficulties. 
Home videotape recording of the child’s 
nighttime breathing has also been shown to be a 
reliable screening method for OSA with a sensitivity 
of 94% and a specificity of 68% in predicting a positive 
study.34 

In early studies of pediatric OSA, 27% to 69% of 
children presented with failure to thrive.3 Now that 
affected children are identified earlier, failure to 
thrive is less common. Five percent of the children in 
our study presented with failure to thrive, which 
agrees with more recent reports of a 4% to 13% 
incidence.6,7 Thirty-four percent of the children in 
our study presented with obesity (BMI 95th percentile), 
which is similar to recent reports of an incidence 
of 26% to 40%.6,7 As demonstrated in previous 
studies, substantial weight gain is often found after 
T&A even in children who are obese preoperatively.
35 

In adults, hypertension is a common complication 
of OSA. Early reports found systemic hypertension 
in 10% to 25% of children with OSA, although these 
children were severely affected.36,37 In a more recent 
report, Kunzman et al38 found no increased incidence 
of systemic hypertension in 22 children with 
OSA as compared with control subjects. Goldstein et 
al7 found that 18% of children who presented for 
evaluation of OSA were hypertensive. Marcus et al39 
found that 41 children with OSA had a significantly 
higher diastolic blood pressure than 26 children with 
primary snoring, although there was no significant 
difference in systolic blood pressure between the 2 
groups. BMI was a significant predictor of elevated 
blood pressure. In our study, 20% of the children 
presented with systemic hypertension, 38% of whom 
were obese. It resolved in all children by final evaluation, 
although 3 new children were hypertensive, 2 
of whom were obese. As indicated in previous re-

ports, systemic hypertension is a complication of 
sleep-disordered breathing, especially in obese children. 
Early studies reported that between 10% and 
56% of children with OSA had pulmonary hypertension 
or cor pulmonale.8,14,36 Now that children receive 
a diagnosis at a much earlier stage, the incidence 
is much lower. In our study of otherwise 
healthy children, only 1 (2%) child presented with 
mild pulmonary hypertension diagnosed by echo-
cardiography. 

PSG has been recommended before T&A to identify 
children who are at risk for postoperative respiratory 
complications. Although the risk of postoperative 
respiratory complications in the general 
pediatric population ranges from 0% to 1.3%, rates of 
16% to 27% have been reported in children with 
OSA.40–43 Risk factors are age under 3, pulmonary 
hypertension or other cardiac abnormalities, craniofacial 
syndromes, failure to thrive, hypotonia, acute 
airway obstruction, morbid obesity, and severe sleep 
study indices. Anesthetic technique including the 
use of opioids has not been shown to influence the 
rate of postoperative respiratory complications.43 
The majority of children described in these studies 
would have been identified by preoperative clinical 
assessment without the need for sleep studies. In 
addition, most postoperative respiratory complications 
occur within 2 hours after surgery.44,45 As long 
as appropriate facilities and staff are available for 
treatment of these children, including the option for 
overnight observation, a preoperative sleep study is 
not necessarily needed. PSG has been most useful to 
confirm the diagnosis of OSA and document its severity 
in the following situations: children who are 
younger than 2 years; high-risk patients for which 
surgery is contraindicated; children with craniofacial 
anomalies, morbid obesity, or cerebral palsy; when 
there is a discrepancy between the history and physical 
examination; and children who remain symptomatic 
after T&A. PSG is also a prerequisite to treatment 
with nasal continuous or bilevel positive 
airway pressure in high-risk children or surgical fail


ures.13,46 

CONCLUSIONS 

Otherwise healthy children with clinical assessments 
suggestive of OSA benefit from T&A even 
when PSG is normal. A significant reduction in a 
clinical assessment score based on the symptoms and 
signs of upper airway obstruction occurs in children 
who undergo T&A as compared with children who 
do not undergo surgery. Our results agree with reports 
of improvement in health-related quality of life 
after T&A performed for treatment of sleep-disordered 
breathing. The current standards for the 
proper definition of a positive PSG in a child as well 
as the appropriate parameters to monitor are currently 
in evolution. If we had evaluated our study 
children for UARS, then our clinical accuracy for 
predicting a positive PSG would have improved. 
Until a noninvasive, reliable, routinely available test 
to diagnosis the full spectrum of sleep-disordered 

breathing is available, clinical assessment remains a 
valuable tool in diagnosing upper airway obstruction 
in children and determining the need for T&A.
