CONCLUSIONS. 
An 
increase 
in 
percentage 
overweight 
after 
T&A 
in 
children 
with 
obstructive 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
is 
correlated 
to 
decreased 
child 
hyperactivity 
scores 
and 
to 
decreased 
measured 
motor 
activity 
in 
the 
subset 
studied. 
These 
associations 
suggest 
that 
the 
increase 
in 
overweight 
may 
be 
attributable 
to 
reductions 
in 
physical 
activity 
and 
fidgeting 
energy 
expenditure.

BSTRUCTIVE 
SLEEP-DISORDERED 
BREATHING 
(OSDB) 
occurs 
in 
3% 
of 
children.1–3 
Adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy 
is 
the 
most 
common 
cause 
of 
OSDB 
in 
young 
children, 
and 
adenotonsillectomy 
(T&A) 
is 
the 
primary 
treatment 
of 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
in 
children.4–6 
OSDB 
in 
children 
has 
been 
associated 
with 
a 
variety 
of 
comorbidities, 
including 
hypertension, 
enuresis, 
poor 
scholastic 
performance, 
hyperactivity, 
and 
attentiondeficit/
hyperactivity 
disorder, 
and 
these 
conditions 
are 
also 
ameliorated 
with 
successful 
treatment 
of 
OSDB 
via 
T&A.7,8 


OSDB 
has 
also 
been 
reported 
to 
influence 
somatic 
growth. 
Several 
studies 
have 
shown 
that 
OSDB 
is 
associated 
with 
reduced 
growth 
in 
height 
and 
weight5,6,9–12 
and 
failure 
to 
thrive 
in 
infants.13 
These 
growth 
alterations 
have 
been 
related 
to 
a 
number 
of 
factors, 
including 
reduced 
secretion 
of 
growth 
hormone 
and 
insulin-
like 
growth 
factor-I,11,14,15 
low 
energy 
intake 
as 
a 
result 
of 
difficulty 
swallowing,16 
and 
increased 
energy 
expenditure 
during 
sleep.5,16 
All 
of 
these 
factors 
are 
reported 
to 
improve 
after 
T&A.6,11,14–16 
Other 
studies, 
however, 
have 
reported 
that 
growth 
in 
children 
with 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy 
and 
OSDB 
is 
normal 
or 
that 
these 
children 
are 
actually 
overweight 
before 
treatment.4,17,18 


After 
T&A, 
normal-weight 
and 
overweight 
children 
with 
or 
without 
OSDB 
rapidly 
gain 
weight.17,18 
Thus, 
although 
T&A 
has 
a 
beneficial 
effect 
on 
OSDB 
symptoms4 
and 
improves 
the 
other 
comorbidities 
listed 
above, 
the 
procedure 
may 
also 
lead 
to 
weight 
gain, 
even 
in 
youths 
who 
are 
already 
overweight. 
Weight 
gain 
in 
already 
overweight 
children 
can 
cause 
recurrent 
or 
persistent 
OSDB,19,20 
as 
well 
as 
contribute 
to 
insulin 
resistance,21,22 
hypertension,23 
and 
other 
chronic 
diseas


es.19,20,24,25 


The 
reasons 
for 
the 
excessive 
weight 
gain 
after 
T&A 
are 
unclear. 
Body 
weight 
changes 
are 
a 
function 
of 
dietary 
energy 
intake 
and 
energy 
expenditure 
through 
basal 
metabolism, 
dietary-induced 
thermogenesis, 
and 
motor 
(physical) 
activity. 
The 
most 
modifiable 
of 
these 
components 
are 
dietary 
energy 
intake 
and 
motor 
activity 
energy 
expenditure. 
A 
single 
study 
investigated 
the 
role 
of 
both 
diet 
and 
energy 
expenditure 
on 
gains 
in 
body 
weight 
after 
T&A 
and 
found 
that 
T&A 
reduced 
sleeping 
energy 
expenditure 
by 
5 
kcal/kg 
body 
weight 
per 
night5; 
however, 
there 
was 
little 
effect 
on 
dietary 
intake. 
OSDB 
has 
also 
been 
linked 
to 
hyperactivity 
disorders 
in 
children,26–28 
and 
T&A 
reduces 
hyperactive 
behavior.29 
If 
T&A 
reduces 
motor 
activity 
or 
hyperactivity, 
then 
the 
corresponding 
reduction 
in 
energy 
expenditure 
may 
lead 
to 
excessive 
positive 
energy 
balance 
and 
weight 
gain 
despite 
minimal 
changes 
in 
energy 
intake. 
The 
purpose 
of 
this 
study 
was 
to 
examine 
the 
effects 
of 
T&A 
in 
children 
with 
OSDB 
on 
weight 
gain, 
motor 
activity, 
and 
hyperactivity. 


METHODS 


Participants 


All 
participants 
were 
volunteers 
who 
signed 
informed 
assent 
and 
whose 
parents 
signed 
written 
informed 
consent 
for 
the 
study. 
The 
University 
of 
Virginia 
Human 
Investigation 
Committee 
approved 
these 
studies. 
We 
studied 
54 
children 
who 
were 
6 
to 
12 
years 
of 
age 
(mean 
. 
SD: 
7.8 
. 
1.7 
years) 
and 
had 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy 
and 
1 
episode 
of 
apnea 
or 
hypopnea 
per 
hour 
of 
sleep 
(obstructive 
apnea-hypopnea 
index 
[OAHI]). 
These 
children 
were 
consecutive 
participants 
in 
a 
study 
on 
the 
effect 
of 
OSDB 
as 
a 
result 
of 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy 
on 
behavior, 
cognitive 
performance, 
and 
anthropometric 
measures 
of 
growth. 
Children 
were 
excluded 
from 
the 
study 
when 
they 
had 
underlying 
cardiac, 
pulmonary, 
neurologic, 
or 
auditory 
disease 
or 
were 
taking 
medication 
that 
alters 
sleep, 
breathing, 
or 
behavior. 
A 
subset 
of 
these 
children 
that 
consisted 
of 
8 
boys 
and 
13 
girls 
(mean 
. 
SD: 
7.8 
. 
1.7 
years) 
were 
also 
investigated 
for 
sleeping 
and 
waking 
motor 
activity. 
This 
subset 
included 
the 
final 
21 
children 
who 
entered 
the 
study 
and 
had 
T&A, 
when 
actigraphy 
data 
collection 
was 
initiated. 


Protocol 


Children 
were 
admitted 
to 
the 
University 
of 
Virginia 
General 
Clinical 
Research 
Center, 
where 
they 
had 
anthropometric 
studies 
and 
overnight 
polysomnography. 
A 
parent 
filled 
out 
questionnaires 
about 
his 
or 
her 
child’s 
clinical 
symptoms 
and 
behavior. 
All 
children 
studied 
received 
T&A 
surgery; 
the 
decision 
to 
perform 
the 
surgery 
was 
made 
by 
the 
children’s 
physician. 
Assessments 
were 
repeated 
on 
all 
children 
on 
average 
of 
12.6 
months 
after 
surgery 
(range: 
6.2–27.4 
months). 
The 
subset 
of 
children 
who 
were 
studied 
for 
motor 
activity 
was 
monitored 
at 
home 
with 
actigraphy 
for 
7 
consecutive 
days 
and 
nights 
before 
admission 
to 
the 
General 
Clinical 
Research 
Center. 


Anthropometrics 


Height 
was 
measured 
to 
the 
nearest 
millimeter 
using 
a 
Harpenden 
stadiometer 
(Cambridge, 
MD), 
and 
weight 
was 
measured 
to 
the 
nearest 
0.1 
kg 
using 
a 
medical 
balance 
beam 
scale 
(Healthometer, 
Bridgeview,

calibrated 
daily. 
Percentiles 
for 
height, 
weight, 
and 
BMI 
(weight 
in 
kg/height 
in 
[cm]2) 
were 
obtained 
using 
Epi 
Info 
public

which 
uses 
data 
obtained

Polysomnography 


Children 
had 
overnight 
polysomnography 
from 
9:00 
PM 
until 
awakening 
using 
conventional 
techniques, 
including 
electroencephalograms 
(C3A2, 
C4A1), 
bilateral 
electro-
oculograms, 
submental 
electromyograms, 
nasal 
airflow 
measured 
with 
a 
nasal 
cannula 
attached 
to 
a 
pressure 
transducer 
(DP 
45, 
Validyne 
Engineering 
Inc, 
Northridge, 
CA), 
oral 
airflow 
measured 
with 
a 
thermistor, 
pulse 
oximetry, 
and 
chest 
and 
abdominal 
movement 
detected 
by 
respiratory 
inductance 
plethysmography 
(NonInvasive 
Monitoring 
Systems, 
Inc, 
North 
Bay 
Village, 
FL). 
Data 
were 
recorded 
on 
a 
Sandman 
sleep 
system 
(Sandman 
Sleep 
Diagnostics, 
Kanata, 
Ontario, 
Canada). 
Polysomnographic 
data 
were 
obtained 
in 
a 
dark 
room 
at 
a 
constant 
temperature. 
Children 
refrained 
from 
caffeine 
on 
the 
day 
of 
the 
study. 
A 
sleep 
technician 
who 
was 
blinded 
to 
the 
results 
of 
the 
questionnaire 
and 
all 
other 
studies 
analyzed 
the 
study 
by 
scoring 
sleep 
with 
conventional 
methods 
for 
children 
and 
scoring 
apneas 
and 
hypopneas. 
Sleep 
staging 
was 
performed 
using 
Rechtschaffen 
and 
Kales 
criteria.31 
Apneas 
were 
characterized 
by 
reductions 
in 
air 
flow 
to 
20% 
of 
normal 
for 
6 
or 
more 
seconds 
or 
2 
respiratory 
cycles, 
and 
hypopneas 
were 
characterized 
by 
reductions 
in 
air 
flow 
to 
60% 
of 
normal 
for 
6 
or 
more 
seconds 
or 
2 
respiratory 
cycles. 
Apneas 
and 
hypopneas 
were 
reported 
to 
be 
obstructive 
when 
the 
chest 
and 
abdomen 
moved 
and 
central 
when 
chest 
and 
abdominal 
movements 
were 
absent. 
Polysomnography 
data 
reported 
in 
this 
study 
include 
sleep 
time, 
percentage 
of 
time 
in 
stages 
1 
through 
4 
of 
sleep, 
percentage 
of 
time 
in 
rapid 
eye 
movement 
sleep, 
and 
OAHI. 


Snoring 
Questionnaire 


A 
sleep 
questionnaire 
was 
administered 
to 
all 
parents 
to 
solicit 
a 
score 
that 
ranged 
from 
1 
to 
5 
regarding 
their 
child’s 
snoring 
frequency.32 
Parents 
were 
asked 
to 
score 
their 
child’s 
snoring 
frequency 
as 
occurring 
(1) 
never, 


(2) 
rarely 
(less 
than 
once 
month), 
(3) 
occasionally 
(1– 
4 
times 
a 
month), 
(4) 
frequently 
(more 
than 
once 
a 
week), 
or 
(5) 
most 
nights.32 
The 
change 
in 
snoring 
frequency 
score 
was 
calculated 
as 
postsurgery 
snoring 
frequency 
score 
minus 
presurgery 
snoring 
frequency 
score. 
Motor 
Activity 


Activity 
was 
measured 
with 
a 
Mini 
Motion 
Logger 
Actigraph 
(Ambulatory 
Monitoring 
Inc, 
Ardsley, 
NY) 
that 
was 
worn 
on 
the 
nondominant 
wrist 
for 
7 
consecutive 
days 
and 
nights, 
including 
the 
night 
of 
polysomnography. 
The 
Actigraph 
measures 
motor 
activity 
by 
acceleration 
changes 
of 
the 
limb. 
The 
Actigraph 
was 
set 
to 
operate 
in 
“zero 
crossing 
mode” 
to 
record 
the 
number 
of 
movements 
within 
a 
1-minute 
interval. 
Calculations 
were 
performed 
with 
Action-W 
software 
version 
2.0. 
Activity 
values 
during 
sleep 
and 
wakefulness 
were 
determined 
by 
multiplying 
the 
counts 
per 
minute 
by 
the 
number 
of 
minutes 
the 
patient 
was 
asleep 
or 
awake, 


respectively. 
Sleep 
and 
awake 
counts 
were 
distinguished 
using 
the 
Sadeh33 
algorithms 
in 
the 
analysis 
software 
package. 
We 
calculated 
counts 
during 
sleep 
periods, 
awake 
periods, 
and 
per 
24-hour 
period 
(daily 
counts). 
The 
change 
in 
daily 
motor 
activity 
was 
calculated 
as 
postsurgery 
counts 
per 
24-hour 
period 
minus 
presurgery 
counts 
per 
24-hour 
period.

Hyperactivity 
was 
accessed 
with 
the 
Conners’ 
Parent 
Rating 
Scale.37 
Each 
child’s 
age 
adjusted 
T-score 
was 
used 
for 
analyses 
of 
the 
hyperactivity 
data. 
The 
Conners’ 
Parent 
Rating 
Scale 
consists 
of 
9 
questions 
answered 
on 
a 
scale 
of 
0 
to 
3: 
0, 
“not 
true 
at 
all 
(never, 
seldom)”; 
1, 
“just 
a 
little 
true 
(occasionally)”; 
2, 
“pretty 
much 
true 
(often, 
quite 
a 
bit)”; 
and 
3, 
“very 
much 
true 
(very 
often, 
very 
frequent).” 
The 
9 
specific 
questions 
are 
as 
follows: 


(1)

in 
malls 
or 
while 
grocery 
shopping, 
(3) 
runs 
about 
or 
climbs 
excessively 
in 
situations 
in 
which 
it 
is 
inappropriate, 
(4) 
excitable 
and 
impulsive, 
(5) 
restless 
in 
the 
squirmy 
sense, 
(6) 
has 
difficulty 
waiting 
in 
lines 
or 
awaiting 
turn 
in 
games 
or 
group 
situations, 
(7) 
will 
run 
around 
between 
mouthfuls 
at 
meals, 
(8) 
has 
difficulty 
playing 
or 
engaging 
in 
leisure 
activities 
quietly, 
and 
(9) 
blurts 
out 
answers 
to 
questions 
before 
the 
questions 
have 
been 
completed.

RESULTS 


Polysomnography 
data 
before 
and 
after 
T&A 
are 
shown 
in 
Table 
1. 
There 
were 
no 
gender 
differences 
or 
gender 
by 
time 
interactions 
for 
any 
polysomnography 
variable 
(P 
. 
.25), 
so 
the 
data 
are 
displayed 
for 
the 
whole 
group. 
Sleep 
time 
did 
not 
differ 
before 
or 
after 
surgery 
(P 
. 
.73). 
The 
percentage 
time 
in 
stage 
1 
sleep 
was 
reduced 
from 
3.0% 
before 
T&A 
to 
2.3% 
after 
T&A, 
a 
23% 
reduction 
(P 
. 
.001). 
OAHI 
decreased 
from 
7.6 
(range: 
1.2– 
37.8) 
to 
0.6 
(range: 
0.0–3.1) 
episodes 
per 
hour 
(P 
. 
.001), 
and 
snoring 
frequency 
score 
also 
decreased 
(P 
. 
.001) 
before 
to 
after 
T&A. 
There 
were 
no 
significant 
differences 
between 
the 
entire 
group 
and 
the 
subset 
of 
21 
children 
who 
were 
investigated 
for 
sleeping 
and 
waking 
motor 
activity 
for 
their 
pre-T&A 
polysomnography 
data 
(Table 
1) 


Anthropometric 
data 
are 
shown 
in 
Table 
2. 
No 
statistically 
significant 
main 
effects 
of 
gender 
emerged 
for 
any 
anthropometric 
variable 
(P 
. 
.23), 
so 
the 
data 
are 
presented 
for 
the 
whole 
group. 
With 
regard 
to 
time 
(before 
vs 
after 
T&A), 
there 
was 
a 
main 
effect 
for 
height 
(P 
. 
.001), 
but 
height 
percentile 
was 
not 
changed 
(P 
.96). 
There 
were 
significant 
increases 
in 
both 
body 
weight 
(P 
. 
.001) 
and 
weight 
percentile 
(P 
. 
.01) 
after 
surgery. 
These 
differential 
rates 
of 
change 
in 
height 
and 
weight 
percentile 
resulted 
in 
increases 
in 
BMI 
(P 
. 
.001), 
BMI 
percentile 
(P 
. 
.04), 
and 
percentage 
overweight 
(P 
. 
.003) 
after 
T&A. 
Individual 
presurgery 
and 
postsurgery 
percentage 
overweight 
data 
are 
plotted 
in 
Fig 
1. 
There 
were 
no 
significant 
gender 
by 
time 
interaction 
effects 
for 
the 
anthropometric 
variables. 
There 
were 
no 
significant 
differences 
between 
the 
entire 
group 
and 
the 
subset 
of 
21 
children 
who 
were 
investigated 
for 
sleeping 
and 
waking 
motor 
activity 
for 
their 
pre-T&A 
anthropometric 
data 
(Table 
2). 


Parent 
ratings 
of 
child 
hyperactivity 
were 
lower 
after 
T&A 
(P 
. 
.01; 
Fig 
2). 
Children 
who 
had 
the 
greatest 
reductions 
in 
snoring 
frequency 
also 
had 
the 
greatest 


reductions 
in 
hyperactivity 
scores 
(. 
. 
0.28, 
P 
. 
.05). 
The 
change 
in 
OAHI 
score 
did 
not 
predict 
the 
change 
in 
hyperactivity 
score 
(. 
. 
0.02, 
P 
. 
.89). 
The 
change 
in 
child 
hyperactivity 
score 
significantly 
predicted 
the 
change 
in 
percentage 
overweight 
when 
controlling 
for 
initial 
hyperactivity 
(Table 
3). 


The 
motor 
activity 
data 
for 
the 
subset 
of 
children 
are 
shown 
in 
Table 
4. 
The 
motor 
activity 
counts 
during 
sleep 
did 
not 
differ 
between 
boys 
and 
girls 
(P 
. 
.17), 
but 
the 
awake 
and 
total 
daily 
counts 
were 
greater 
in 
boys 
than 
in 
girls 
(P 
. 
.05). 
The 
total 
daily, 
awake, 
and 
sleep 
counts 
all 
decreased 
after 
T&A 
(P 
. 
.05). 
There 
was 
an 
inverse 
correlation 
for 
change 
scores 
of 
total 
daily 
motor 
activity 
counts 
and 
percentage 
overweight 
(. 
0.54, 
P 


. 
.01; 
Fig 
3). 
The 
change 
in 
total 
daily 
motor 
activity 
from 
actigraphy 
did 
not 
predict 
the 
change 
in 
hyperactivity 
score 
(.

P

DISCUSSION 


This 
study 
demonstrates 
that 
children 
who 
have 
OSDB 
and 
are 
treated 
with 
T&A 
have 
an 
increase 
in 
weight, 
BMI 
percentile, 
and 
percentage 
overweight. 
They 
also 
had 
a 
decrease 
in 
hyperactivity 
and 
in 
sleep, 
waking, 
and 
total 
daily 
motor 
activity. 
The 
increase 
in 
percentage 
overweight 
correlated 
inversely 
with 
the 
changes 
in 
hyperactivity 
and 
total 
daily 
motor 
activity. 


The 
OAHI 
range 
of 
our 
patients 
seems 
to 
be 
typical 
of 
OSDB. 
For 
example, 
Kaeminigk 
et 
al38 
reported 
that 
in 
6-to 
12-year-old 
children, 
the 
AHI 
was 
5 
in 
72 
subjects 
and 
5 
in 
77. 
O’Brien 
et 
al39 
reported 
35 
children 
with 
sleep 
disordered 
breathing 
and 
a 
mean 
age 
of 
6.7 
had 
a 
mean 
AHI 
of 
9.8. 
These 
findings 
are 
similar 
to 
the 
mean 
AHI 
of 
6.7 
in 
our 
male 
subjects 
and 
8.0 
in 
our 
female 
subjects. 


Although 
the 
OAHI 
range 
was 
similar 
to 
previous 
studies, 
the 
weight 
status 
of 
the 
youths 
in 
the 
present 
study 
was 
greater 
than 
that 
in 
previous 
studies 
of 
children 
with 
OSDB 
of 
similar 
age. 
Before 
T&A, 
the 
participants’ 
weight 
was 
at 
the 
73rd 
percentile, 
which 
corresponds 
to 
an 
average 
overweight 
of 
32%. 
Barr 
et 
al17 
reported 
the 
median 
weight 
of 
8.5-year-old 
children

Vertical

of 
the

each 
of 
the 
54 
children 
studied. 


with 
OSDB 
was 
at 
the 
55th 
percentile, 
whereas 
Conlon 
et 
al40 
reported 
that 
7-year-old 
children 
with 
OSDB 
were 
10% 
overweight. 
Studies 
have 
indicated 
that 
children 
with 
OSDB 
are 
overweight.41,42 
However, 
it 
is 
unclear 
why 
the 
children 
in 
the 
present 
study 
had 
greater 
overweight. 
They 
were 
not 
recruited 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
weight 
status 
and 
were 
screened 
for 
predisposing 
medical 
conditions 
related 
to 
overweight 
before 
entering 
the 
study. 
Perhaps 
the 
greater 
overweight 
of 
the 
present 
sample 
compared 
with 
studies 
that 
were 
completed 
10 
to 
20 
years 
previously 
is 
a 
function 
of 
the 
greater 
prevalence 
of 
pediatric 
overweight 
and 
the 
rightward 
shift 
in 
the 
magnitude 
of 
overweight 
in 
the 
general 
population.43–45 


After 
surgery, 
the 
weight 
of 
the 
children 
in 
the 
present 
study 
increased 
further 
as 
indicated 
by 
a 
significant 
increase 
in 
weight 
percentile 
and 
a 
significant 
12.5% 
increase 
in 
percentage 
overweight, 
whereas 
the 
rate 
of 
statural 
growth 
was 
maintained. 
Such 
excessive 
weight 
gain 
is 
a 
concern 
because 
obesity 
may 
be 
a 
primary 
cause 
of 
OSDB19,20 
and 
additional 
weight 
gain 
may 



lead 
to 
a 
future 
reoccurrence 
of 
OSDB 
in 
youths 
who 
are 
already 
overweight 
and 
particularly 
susceptible 
to 
developing 
OSDB. 
Weight 
gain 
after 
T&A 
has 
been 
noted 
previously 
in 
both 
normal 
or 
underweight5,11,12 
and 
overweight4,18 
children 
with 
OSDB. 


The 
postsurgical 
increase 
in 
overweight 
has 
been 
attributed 
to 
fewer 
episodes 
of 
sore 
throat, 
which 
reduces 
dietary 
intake 
as 
a 
result 
of 
throat 
pain.16,17 
This 
explanation 
is 
unlikely 
in 
the 
present 
study 
because 
many 
of 
the 
children 
were 
overweight 
preoperatively. 
Moreover, 
the 
only 
investigation 
to 
study 
energy 
intake 
after 
T&A 
reported 
an 
excessive 
increase 
in 
weight 
with 
no 
change 
in 
energy 
intake.5 
If 
the 
increase 
in 
adiposity 
after 
T&A 
is 
not 
a 
result 
of 
increased 
energy 
intake,

in 
sleep 
energy 
expenditure 
was 
attributable 
to 
a 
decreased 
work 
of 
breathing.5 
In 
another 
study,46 
7 
children 
with 
OSDB 
were 
studied 
for 
polysomnography 
before 
and 
after 
T&A, 
and 
3 
had 
improvements 
in 
OAHI. 
Two 
of 
these 
children 
had 
small 
increases 
in 
energy 
expenditure, 
whereas 
the 
other 
had 
a 
small 
reduction 
in 
energy 
expenditure. 
However, 
the 
total 
energy 
expenditure 
of 
a 
group 
of 
11 
children 
did 
not 
differ 
from 
control 
subjects, 
suggesting 
that 
OSDB 
did 
not 
alter 
total 
energy 
expenditure. 
To 
our 
knowledge, 
the 
current 
study 
is 
the 
first 
to 
demonstrate 
a 
significant 
reduction 
in 
sleep, 
waking, 
and 
total 
daily 
motor 
activity 
of 
children 
with 
OSDB 
after 
T&A 
and 
the 
association 
of 
greater 
reductions 
in 
total 
daily 
motor 
activity 
with 
greater 
increases 
in 
the 
percentage 
of 
overweight 
in 
children. 


The 
reduction 
in 
motor 
activity 
would 
lead 
to 
weight 
gain 
if 
energy 
intake 
is 
maintained 
at 
pre-T&A 
levels 
or 
indeed 
is 
increased 
as 
a 
result 
of 
fewer 
sore 
throats. 


Fidgeting 
and 
other 
forms 
of 
nonexercise 
activity 
that 
occur 
during 
sleep 
and 
throughout 
the 
day 
can 
protect 
against 
weight 
gain. 
For 
example, 
among 
adults 
who 
were 
overfed 
by 
1000 
kcal/day 
for 
8 
weeks, 
those 
who 
had 
the 
greatest 
increases 
in 
nonexercise 
activity 
thermogenesis 
gained 
the 
least 
body 
fat.47 
Thus, 
we 
hypothesize 
that 
postsurgery 
reductions 
in 
motor 
activity 
and 
energy 
expenditure 
lead 
to 
increased 
weight 
gain. 
T&A 
may 
also 
reduce 
the 
number 
and 
the 
severity 
of 
sore 
throats, 
resulting 
in 
increased 
energy 
intake, 
although 
there 
currently 
are 
no 
data 
to 
support 
this 
theory. 


Similar 
to 
changes 
in 
motor 
activity, 
changes 
in 
hyperactivity 
scores 
were 
inversely 
correlated 
with 
the 
change 
in 
percentage 
overweight. 
Studies 
have 
shown 
that 
hyperactive 
children 
exhibit 
excessive 
movement 
while 
awake 
and 
during 
sleep,6,48,49 
suggesting 
that 
hyperactivity 
may 
be 
a 
portion 
of 
the 
motor 
activity 
measured 
by 
actigraphy. 
However, 
there 
was 
a 
very 
low 
correlation 
between 
the 
change 
in 
hyperactivity 
score 
and 
total 
daily 
motor 
activity 
in 
the 
present 
study, 
suggesting 
that 
actigraphy 
and 
the 
hyperactivity 
score 
are 
measuring 
different 
constructs 
that 
both 
are 
inversely 
related 
to 
changes 
in 
percentage 
overweight. 


We 
observed 
that 
reductions 
in 
parent 
report 
of 
child 
hyperactivity 
were 
also 
correlated 
to 
reductions 
in 
snoring 
frequency. 
Previous 
studies 
have 
reported 
reductions 
in 
hyperactivity 
and 
snoring 
after 
T&A6,28,29,50 
and 
reported 
cross-sectional 
relationships 
between 
snoring 
frequency 
and 
hyperactivity 
in 
children,26 
but 
ours 
is 
the 
first 
study 
to 
report 
a 
direct 
correlation 
between 
changes 
in 
snoring 
and 
hyperactivity 
scores. 
The 
reduction 
in 
hyperactivity 
and 
snoring 
after 
T&A 
and 
the 
direct 
relationship 
between 
changes 
in 
snoring 
and 
hyperactivity 
scores 
after 
surgery 
suggest 
that 
high-resistance 
breathing 
may 
promote 
hyperactivity 
in 
children. 
However, 
these 
results 
are 
limited 
by 
their 
correlational 
nature,

There

which 
cannot 
prove 
cause– 
effect, 
and 
the 
use 
of 
subjective 
parental 
report 
of 
snoring 
frequency. 
Nonetheless, 
parental 
history 
of 
frequent 
snoring 
is 
a 
robust 
predictor 
of 
poor 
school 
performance51 
and 
cognitive 
impairment 
in 
children 
with 
sleep-disordered 
breathing.39,51,52 
This 
may 
be 
because 
children 
with 
OSDB 
have 
primarily 
high-resistance 
breathing 
without 
frequent 
apneas 
or 
hypopneas. 
The 
polysomnogram 
is 
not 
very 
sensitive 
to 
high-resistance 
breathing 
without 
apneas 
unless 
children 
swallow 
an 
esophageal 
catheter. 
High-resistance 
breathing 
is 
probably 
identified 
by 
parents 
as 
snoring. 


As 
others 
have 
shown,53–56 
T&A 
reduced 
the 
number 
of 
apnea 
and 
hypopnea 
episodes 
during 
sleep 
(OAHI) 
in 
children 
with 
hypertrophied 
tonsils 
and 
adenoids. 
The 
reduction 
in 
OAHI 
was 
accompanied 
by 
improvements 
in 
sleep 
architecture, 
including 
a 
significant 
reduction 
in 
the 
percentage 
of 
time 
in 
stage 
1 
sleep 
from 
3.0% 
to 
2.3% 
(a 
23% 
decrease). 
Although 
the 
clinical 
importance 
of 
this 
degree 
of 
change 
is 
not 
clear, 
improvements 
in 
sleep 
quality 
and 
reduced 
hyperactive 
behavior 
may 
improve 
children’s 
ability 
to 
focus 
and 
be 
attentive 
during 
school 
and 
result 
in 
improved 
learning. 


Another 
limitation 
of 
this 
study 
was 
that 
it 
did 
not 
include 
a 
control 
group 
of 
youths 
who 
had 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy 
and 
did 
not 
have 
T&A. 
It 
would 
be 
ethically 
difficult 
to 
randomly 
assign 
children 
who 
have 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy 
and 
have 
frequent 
snoring 
or 
are 
found 
to 
have 
OSDB 
by 
polysomnography 
to 
a 
control 
group 
that 
did 
not 
have 
T&A 
because 
these 
children 
have 
a 
higher-than-normal 
risk 
for 
impaired 
cognitive 
function 
or 
behavioral 
problems.7,8 
A 
nonrandomized 
control 
group 
of 
children 
who 
had 
OSDB 
as 
a 
result 
of 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy 
and 
whose 
parents 
chose 
for 
the 
child 
not 
to 
have 
T&A 
would 
not 
have 
been 
a 
proper 
control 
group 
because 
the 
decision 
to 
have 
T&A 



may 
be 
influenced 
by 
OSDB 
severity, 
parent 
concern 
regarding 
OSDB, 
and 
parental 
ability 
to 
pay 
for 
surgery. 


CONCLUSIONS 


Children 
who 
had 
OSDB 
and 
underwent 
T&A 
exhibited 
significant 
improvements 
in 
OSDB 
symptoms 
and 
increases 
in 
BMI 
percentile 
and 
percentage 
overweight. 
Furthermore, 
significant 
reductions 
in 
total 
daily 
motor 
activity 
and 
parent 
report 
of 
hyperactivity 
were 
correlated 
to 
significant 
increases 
in 
percentage 
overweight. 
Future 
studies 
that 
examine 
concomitant 
changes 
in 
OSDB, 
hyperactivity, 
physical 
activity, 
dietary 
intake, 
and 
growth 
in 
height 
and 
weight 
before 
and 
after 
T&A 
may 
provide 
a 
basis 
for 
developing 
exercise 
and 
dietary 
prescriptions 
for 
children 
who 
undergo 
T&A 
for 
the 
treatment 
of 
OSDB 
that 
may 
help 
to 
prevent 
excessive 
weight 
gain.
