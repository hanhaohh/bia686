Obstructive sleep-disordered breathing is associated with cardiovascular 
disease in adults, and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) 
has been proposed as a link between the two disorders. We hypothesized 
that children with sleep-disordered breathing have higher 
CRP values than do control subjects. CRP was measured in 39 children 
(mean age . 
SD: 6.9 . 
3.2 years) without snoring (controls) 
and in 102 children (6.2 . 
2.2 years) with habitual snoring who 
underwent polysomnography. No significant differences were 
found in mean CRP values between control subjects (0.12 . 
0.16 
mg/dl; n . 
39) and snorers with an apnea-hypopnea index of less 
than 1 episode/hour (0.15 . 
0.26; n . 
18), snorers with an index 
of 1 or more and less than 5 (0.15 . 
0.26; n . 
54), and snorers 
with an index of 5 or more (0.22 . 
0.43; n . 
30; p . 
0.05). There 
was no correlation between CRP or log-transformed CRP values 
and apnea–hypopnea index, respiratory movement/arousal index, 
SaO2 nadir, oxygen desaturation (. 
4%) of hemoglobin index, or 
percentage of sleep time with saturation less than 95% (p . 
0.05). 
Thus, findings of higher CRP values in adults with sleep-disordered 
breathing and correlations of these values with polysomnography 
indices were not confirmed in children.

Recent studies have identified significant correlations between 
obstructive sleep-disordered breathing and cardiovascular disease 
in adults. Obstructive sleep apnea–hypopnea (OSAH) correlates 
at least modestly with systemic hypertension, coronary artery 
disease, congestive heart failure, and stroke (1–3). Cardiovascular 
morbidity is increased even in subjects with mild elevations 
(1–10 episodes/hour) of the apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) (1). 

Chronic inflammatory processes participate in the pathogenesis 
of cardiovascular events (4, 5). In addition, OSAH in adults 
has been related to increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), 
a marker of inflammation and cardiovascular risk (6, 7). A CRP 
value of more than 0.2 mg/dl is a predictor of cardiovascular 
events in apparently healthy men and women (4, 5). Therefore, 
CRP may be one of the links between OSAH and cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) (6, 7). Several other risk factors for cardiovascular 
disease, such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia, 
are also correlated with CRP levels (4, 5, 8). 

Similarly to adults, OSAH can affect the cardiovascular system 
of children (9–13). In a recent pediatric report (14), significant 
associations have been described between CRP levels and

indices of severity of sleep-disordered breathing. The aim of the 
present investigation was to compare morning levels of CRP in 
children, with and without habitual snoring, and to confirm the 
recently described associations between these levels and polysomnography 
indices (14). Our hypothesis was that children with 
snoring have higher CRP values than control subjects. Some of 
the results of this study have been previously reported in the 
form of an abstract (15). 

METHODS 

Study Design 

The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the Larissa 
University Hospital. Consecutive children who were referred to the 
Sleep Disorders Laboratory because of habitual snoring (. 
3 nights/ 
week) that had been present for at least 6 months were considered for 
participation in the study. Healthy children without a history of snoring 
who presented to the General Pediatrics clinic for well child visits and 
who had blood drawn for routine measurement of hematocrit were 
also recruited as control subjects. Exclusion criteria for children with 
snoring and for control subjects were as follows: (1 ) symptoms or signs 
of acute or chronic inflammation, (2 ) use of corticosteroids or antibiotics 
for the 4 weeks preceding recruitment in the study, (3 ) cardiovascular 
disease or diabetes mellitus, and (4 ) neuromuscular or genetic disorders. 

Informed consent was obtained from parents of all participants and 
child assent from subjects older than 8 years. Parents were interviewed 
and a questionnaire (online supplement) based on previous studies 
was answered (16–18). Questions inquired about symptoms of sleep-
disordered breathing, past medical history, and family history. All subjects 
underwent a physical examination, and tonsillar size was graded 
from0to4. 
(19). A tonsillar size of 2. 
or greater was defined as 
tonsillar hypertrophy (20). Polysomnograms were performed overnight 
in the Sleep Disorders Laboratory for all children with snoring but not 
for control subjects. Polysomnography methods and analysis of data 
are described in the online supplement. 

Venous blood was collected between 8:00 and 10:00 a.m. from all 
subjects. For children with snoring, venipuncture was completed after 
polysomnography. Serum was obtained immediately from the blood 
sample and was stored at 70 C until assay. CRP levels were quantified 
by a high-sensitivity immunonephelometric method with a lowest detection 
limit of 0.0175 mg/dl (N High Sensitivity CRP; Dade Behring, 
Marburg, Germany). All measurements were completed in 1 day using 
stored serum to avoid interassay variability. Serum triglycerides and 
cholesterol levels were also measured. 

Data Analysis and Statistics 

Four groups of subjects were formed: (1 ) healthy control subjects without 
snoring, (2 ) snorers with an AHI of less than 1 episode/hour, (3 ) 
snorers with an AHI of 1 episode/hour or more and fewer than 5 
episodes/hour, and (4 ) snorers with an AHI of 5 or more episodes/ 
hour. For continuous characteristics, the study groups were compared 
by one-way analysis of variance. For categorical characteristics, the 2 
test (Yate’s correction) was applied.

Pearson’s correlation was used to assess the association of CRP 
values with polysomnography indices. To identify independent predictors 
of CRP levels, we performed stepwise multiple linear regression 
analysis (SPSS version 10.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL). CRP was the dependent 
variable and AHI, age, sex, relative body mass index (BMI), triglycer

using standard growth curves (21). The previous analysis was 
also repeated with log-transformed CRP values for consistency to the 
analysis by Tauman and colleagues (14). 

Sample Size Calculation 

The required sample size to detect a difference of 0.25 mg/dl in CRP 
levels between control subjects and snorers with an AHI of 5 or more 
episodes/hour (which is the comparison of interest), assuming a pooled 
SD of 0.35 with 90% power at the 5% level, was 45 subjects in each 
group (22). The expected difference in CRP levels between the two 
groups, which might be considered clinically important, and the pooled 
SD were specified on the basis of the only previous published pediatric 
study (14). 

RESULTS 

Patient Characteristics and Results of Polysomnography 

Thirty-nine healthy control subjects without snoring (mean 
age SD: 6.9 3.2 years; age range 2–13 years) were recruited 
together with 102 children with habitual snoring (6.2 2.2 years; 
range 1.9–12 years). Eighteen subjects with sleep-disordered 
breathing had an AHI of less than 1 episode/hour; 54 subjects 
had an AHI of 1 or more and fewer than 5 episodes/hour; and 
30 subjects had an AHI of 5 or more episodes/hour. The frequency 
of sleep-disordered breathing symptoms and tonsillar 
size in subjects with habitual snoring and in control subjects and 

polysomnography indices only in subjects with habitual snoring 
are presented in Table 1. Of the control subjects, 3 of 39 (7.6%) 
had tonsillar hypertrophy and 93 of 102 (91%) children with 
habitual snoring had this condition. 

By recruiting 39 control subjects and 30 snorers with an AHI of 
5 or more episodes/hour (i.e., an effective total size of 68), the 
probability of detecting the expected difference, which was specified 
in the sample size calculation, was 79% at the 5% level (22). 

C-Reactive Protein Measurements 

There were no significant differences between control subjects 
and the other three study groups regarding CRP and log-transformed 
CRP values (p 0.05; Table 2). No differences were 
found among the study groups regarding characteristics that may 
affect CRP values (Table 2). 

No significant relationships were identified between CRP levels 
and the following factors: AHI (r 0.04, p 0.05; Figure 1), 
respiratory movement/arousal index (r 0.08, p 0.05; 
Figure 2), SaO2 nadir (r 0.05, p 0.05; Figure 3), oxygen 
desaturation of hemoglobin index (r 0.04, p 0.05), or percentage 
of sleep time with SaO2 less than 95% (r 0.06, p . 
0.05). When multiple linear regression was performed, AHI, age, 
sex, relative BMI, serum triglycerides, and cholesterol were not 
significant predictors of CRP values. 

Similarly, no significant relationships were found between 
log-transformed CRP levels and the following: AHI (r 0.04, 
p 0.05), respiratory movement/arousal index (r 0.002, p .

regression analysis identified relative BMI as the only significant 
predictor of log-transformed CRP values (p .

Two of the children with habitual snoring had a low AHI 
and a high CRP values (index of 4.2 episodes/hour and CRP 
value of 1.80 mg/dl; index of 6.2 episodes/hour and CRP value of 

2.21 mg/dl). These extreme values were excluded and statistical 
analysis was repeated. There were still no significant differences 
between control subjects and the other three study groups regarding 
CRP and log-transformed CRP values (p . 
0.05). No 
significant relationships were identified between CRP or log-
transformed CRP values and polysomnography indices. Multiple 
linear regression analysis, including AHI, age, sex, relative BMI, 
serum triglycerides, and cholesterol as independent variables was 
also repeated. Relative BMI was the only significant predictor of 
both CRP and log-transformed CRP levels (p . 
0.05). 
DISCUSSION 

Studies in adults with OSAH have detected elevated values 
of CRP that are correlated with severity of sleep-disordered 
breathing (6, 7). Because CRP is a marker of inflammation and 
cardiovascular risk (4, 5), its association with obstructive sleep-
disordered breathing could be one of the pathophysiologic links 
between obstructive sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease (3). 
CRP values in adults are also affected by other cardiovascular 
risk factors that are less frequently present in children, such as 
obesity, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus (4, 5, 8). 

In this investigation of healthy children without apparent 
risk factors for cardiovascular disease, no statistically significant

differences in CRP or log-transformed CRP values were identified 
between groups of habitual snorers with sleep-disordered 
breathing of variable severity and control subjects without snoring. 
All four groups were similar regarding factors that may have 
affected CRP values (age, sex, relative BMI, serum triglycerides, 
or cholesterol) (23, 24). Our findings differ from those of previous 
reports in adults (6, 7) and children (14). 

CRP or log-transformed CRP values did not show any association 
with several different indices of severity of sleep-disordered 
breathing, whereas relative BMI was the only significant predictor 
of log-transformed CRP values, but not of raw CRP values. 
This discrepancy occurred because when the data are log-
transformed, the linear fit is improved (25). The improvement 
was mainly related to the two subjects with high CRP levels. 
After excluding the two subjects, relative BMI was a significant 
predictor of both raw CRP values and log-transformed CRP 
values. 

Higher serum CRP levels have been reported in adults with 
OSAH than in control subjects (6, 7). CRP levels ranged from 

0.09 to 2.73 mg/dl (median 0.33 mg/dl) in 22 adult subjects with 
an AHI of 20 or more episodes/hour and from 0.02 to 0.9 mg/dl 
(median 0.09 mg/dl) in 20 control subjects with an AHI of 5 or 
fewer episodes/hour (6). CRP was positively associated with AHI. 
In a second report, which included 30 adult patients with 
obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and 14 obese control subjects, 
mean CRP values (. 
SD) were as follows: 0.27 . 
0.03 mg/dl in 
patients with an AHI of 20 or more episodes/hour, 0.13 . 
0.03 
mg/dl in those with an AHI of 5 or more and fewer than 20 
episodes/hour, and 0.07 . 
0.0001 mg/dl in obese control subjects 
(7). Levels of CRP were positively correlated with AHI, percentage 
of sleep time with SaO2 less than 90%, BMI, and serum 
triglycerides levels, and negatively correlated with SaO2 nadir 
during sleep. 

In the pediatric report by Tauman and colleagues (14), mean 
log-transformed plasma CRP levels (. 
SD) were higher in children 
with an AHI of 5 or more episodes/hour (mean log-transformed 
CRP: 0.51 . 
0.4; mean CRP: 0.46 . 
0.39 mg/dl) than 
in subjects with an AHI of 1 or more episodes/hour and fewer 
than 5 episodes/hour (mean log-transformed CRP: 0.91 . 
0.28; 
mean CRP: 0.15 . 
0.12 mg/dl) and in those with an AHI of less 
than 1 episode/hour (control subjects; mean log-transformed 
CRP: 0.8 . 
0.33; mean CRP: 0.22 . 
0.27 mg/dl). Log-transformed 
CRP values were positively correlated with AHI and 
arousal index and negatively correlated with SaO2. 

Raw CRP values in the present report and in the report by 
Tauman and colleagues (14) were similar in subjects with an 
AHI of fewer than 5 episodes/hour. However, in the present 
study, children with an AHI of 5 or more episodes/hour had 
lower CRP values (mean CRP: 0.22 . 
0.43 mg/dl) compared 


Kaditis, Alexopoulos, Kalampouka, et al.: CRP and Snoring 

with children with the same AHI in the published pediatric 
report (mean CRP: 0.46 . 
0.39 mg/dl). In contrast to the report 
by Tauman and colleagues, CRP and log-transformed CRP values 
in our subjects were not associated with any polysomnography 
indices. 

When comparing the present investigation to the study by 
Tauman and colleagues (14) regarding subjects’ characteristics, 
female-to-male ratio, cholesterol levels, and severity of sleep-
disordered breathing were the same. For example, in this series, 
children with an AHI of 5 or more episodes/hour had a mean 
(. 
SD) AHI of 12.3 . 
8.9 episodes/hour and an SaO2 nadir of 

83.1 . 
4.4%; in the series by Tauman and colleagues, however, 
children with an AHI of 5 or more episodes/hour had a mean 
AHI of 14.6 . 
14 episodes/hour and a mean SaO2 nadir of 83.4 . 
7.8%. 
Major discrepancies in the results between the two studies 
may be because of differences in subjects’ age and in obesity. 
The children in the present investigation were younger, leaner, 
and had lower serum triglyceride levels than participants in the 
study by Tauman and colleagues (14). The duration of the disorder 
in respiration could affect CRP values. Because children in 
the study by Tauman and colleagues were older than subjects 
in this report, they conceivably had sleep-disordered breathing 
for more years. The lower relative BMI and serum triglycerides 
in our subjects may reflect differences in prevalence of childhood 
obesity between the two populations from which children for 
each study were recruited (Thessaly, Greece, and Kentucky). 

Differences in subjects’ relative BMI between the two reports 
(higher in the study by Tauman and colleagues) were more 
apparent in children with an AHI of 5 or more episodes/hour. 
Serum CRP in adults has been positively associated with BMI 
(23), and this association has been attributed to secretion of 
interleukin 6 (IL-6) by adipose tissue (26), which regulates CRP 
production in the liver (27). CRP values in the two studies were 
controlled statistically for BMI. Nevertheless, the difference in 
subjects’ mean relative BMI between the two reports may still 
be one of the reasons that children with snoring and an AHI of 
5 or more episodes/hour in the series by Tauman and colleagues 
had higher CRP values than participants with a similar AHI in 
this investigation. 

Furthermore, adipocytes produce adiponectin, a hydrophilic 
protein with protective metabolic and antiinflammatory properties 
(28). Adiponectin plasma levels and gene expression are 
significantly reduced in obese adults (29). An independent inverse 
correlation between plasma adiponectin levels and CRP 
has been documented in obese adults (29). This correlation may 
also be present in children and may contribute to the higher 
CRP values in subjects of the study by Tauman and colleagues 
compared with children in the present report, who had a lower 
relative BMI. 

Finally, a recent report demonstrated that severity of sleep-
disordered breathing relates to fasting insulin levels in obese 
children, a proxy measure of insulin resistance (30). Increasing 
levels of CRP are associated with elevated fasting insulin among 
nondiabetic women (31). Because children in the study by Tau-
man and colleagues (14) were more obese than our subjects, 
sleep-disordered breathing in those children may be correlated 
with higher insulin, IL-6, and CRP levels. 

In subjects with habitual snoring, IL-6 could also be released 
by the intensely working respiratory muscles that try to overcome 
the increased upper airway resistance during sleep. Strenuous 
resistive breathing in both animals and humans increases 
IL-6 levels if a certain inspiratory threshold is exceeded (32, 33). 
If IL-6 is released from the respiratory muscles in children with 
sleep-disordered breathing, this could also explain why mean 
CRP values are not consistently higher in subjects with an AHI 

of 5 or more episodes/hour compared with children with an AHI 
of fewer than 5 episodes/hour or with control subjects. 

Although the AHI describes the frequency of apneas and 
hypopneas, it does not accurately reflect the work of breathing 
in children whose disordered respiration during sleep is characterized 
by hypopneas of variable duration. Therefore, the absence 
of correlation between AHI and levels of CRP is not 
surprising. Two children with the same AHI value could differ 
in the degree of upper airway obstruction, work of breathing, 
IL-6, and CRP levels during sleep. Confirmation of this speculation 
requires the concomitant determination of IL-6 and CRP 
values together with measurement of work of breathing using 
an esophageal balloon. 

The role of CRP in adults with sleep-disordered breathing is 
still uncertain. CRP could simply be a marker of chronic vascular 
inflammation and/or an active participant in processes leading 
to atherosclerosis (4, 5, 34, 35). Published reports from adult 
subjects have associated obstructive sleep-disordered breathing 
with the following: (1 ) increased expression of adhesion molecules 
on monocytes; (2) increased serum levels of intercellular 
adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and 
L-selectin; and (3 ) increased adherence of monocytes to endothelial 
cells in cultures (36–38). These findings together with the 
increased production of reactive oxygen species by monocytes 
and granulocytes exposed to recurrent hypoxia (39) indicate that 
sleep-disordered breathing promotes vascular inflammation and 
atherosclerosis (40, 41). 

CRP is elevated in the presence of acute or chronic inflammation 
and therefore children with any symptoms or signs of an 
inflammatory process were excluded from participation in the 
study (42). A possible limitation of the present study would be 
that polysomnography was not performed in control subjects 
because this was not acceptable by their parents. In addition, 
thermistors were used to detect decreases in airflow instead 
of measuring end-tidal CO2 as an index of hypoventilation. In 
previous studies (6, 7), subjects with snoring and a low AHI 
(. 
5 episodes/hour) have been recruited as controls instead of 
including healthy subjects without snoring. In this report, children 
without snoring were an additional control group supplementary 
to the group of snorers with a low AHI (. 
1 episode/ 
hour). 

In conclusion, findings of higher CRP values in adults with 
obstructive sleep-disordered breathing and correlations of these 
values with polysomnography indices are not consistently present 
in children. The reported results may indicate that not all 
children with sleep-disordered breathing have associated vascular 
inflammation.
