Objective: To determine the relationship between child 
behavior and quality of life before and after tonsillectomy 
and adenoidectomy by means of a standardized assessment 
of child behavior, the Child Behavior Checklist 
(CBCL), and a validated quality-of-life survey of 
pediatric obstructive sleep apnea, the OSA-18. 

Design: Before-after study. 

Setting: Hospital-based pediatric otolaryngology practice 
in a metropolitan area. 

Participants: Sixty-four children (mean [SD] age, 5.8 

[3.1] years; 36 boys, 28 girls) who underwent tonsillectomy 
and adenoidectomy for treatment of sleep-
disordered breathing or recurrent tonsillitis. 
Intervention: Parents or caretakers completed the 
OSA-18 and the CBCL for ages 2 to 3 years or 4 to 18 
years before surgery and 3 months postoperatively. 

Main Outcome Measures: The OSA-18 mean survey 
scores and change scores, and the CBCL total problem 
T scores and change in total problem T scores. 

Results: The mean (SD) preoperative OSA-18 score was 

3.9 (1.5) and change score was 2.3 (95% confidence interval, 
1.9-2.7). The mean total problem score was 7.3 
points lower after surgery (95% confidence interval, 4.99.7), 
indicating a significant decrease (P.001, matched 
t test). The preoperative CBCL total problem score was 
consistent with abnormal behavior for 16 children (25%), 
but only 5 children (8%) scored in the abnormal range 
postoperatively (P=.03, log-likelihood ratio test). The 
OSA-18 preoperative mean survey score had fair to good 
correlation with the preoperative CBCL total problem T 
score (r=0.50, P.001, Pearson correlation), and the 
OSA-18 change score had fair to good correlation with 
the change in CBCL total problem T score (r = 0.54, 
P.001, Pearson correlation). 
Conclusions: Behavioral and emotional difficulties are 
found in children with sleep-disordered breathing before 
treatment and improve after intervention. Scores on 
a standardized measure of assessment of behavior demonstrate 
significant correlation with scores on a validated 
quality-of-life instrument.

LEEP-DISORDERED BREATHING in 
children is viewed as a continuum 
of severity from partial 
obstruction of the upper 
airway producing snoring to 
increased upper airway resistance to continuous 
episodes of complete upper airway 
obstruction or obstructive apnea. The 
prevalence of pediatric obstructive sleep apnea 
syndrome (OSAS) has been estimated 
to be between 1% and 3% in preschool and 
school-aged children.1 Children with OSAS 
are usually brought to medical attention 
because of nighttime breathing difficulties. 
While behavioral, emotional, and neurocognitive 
difficulties have long been 
anecdotally associated with pediatric 
OSAS, recent reports using standardized 
behavioral assessments are supporting 
these observations.1-7 

The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) 
is a standardized measure of children’s behavior.
8,9 In a pilot study by our group of 
36 children undergoing tonsillectomy and 
adenoidectomy (T & A) for chronic upper 
airway obstruction,3 10 (28%) scored 
in the abnormal range on the preoperative 
CBCL. The CBCL scores significantly 
improved after T & A (n=15), although 
changes in classification (normal, 
borderline, or abnormal) were not statistically 
significant. Limitations of that study 
included a small sample size and lack of a 
control group. 

The OSA-18 is an 18-item health-
related quality-of-life (QOL) survey of pediatric 
OSAS that has been correlated with 
the respiratory disturbance index on nap 
polysomnography.10 Because of its ease of 
administration, reliability, validity, and re

RESULTS 
Parents of 133 children were offered participation in the 
protocol, and 71 agreed to participate. Complete preoperative 
and postoperative surveys were available for 64 children 
who composed the study population. Patient demographics 
and indication for surgery are presented in 
Table 1. The male-female ratio was 1.3:1, and the mean 
patient age was 5.8 years (range, 2.0-18.1 years). Fifty parents 
(83%) who completed the surveys had graduated from 
high school and 12 (20%) had graduated from college. Most 
families were middle or upper middle class (annual family 
income between $21000 and $100000).13 Surgery was 
performed for the treatment of OSAS–upper airway obstruction 
in 39 children (61%), recurrent tonsillitis in 10 
(16%), and both obstruction and tonsillitis in 15 (23%). 
The majority of children with upper airway obstruction were 
diagnosed by clinical assessment, as only 5 (8%) had preoperative 
polysomnograms (mean respiratory disturbance 
index, 25.2; range, 3.9-74.5).

toms, and caregiver concerns were the highest-rated domains, 
followed by emotional symptoms and daytime 
function. Change scores (preoperative mean scores minus 
postoperative mean scores) for sleep disturbance, caregiver 
concerns, and physical symptoms indicate a large 
change in QOL (change score of 1.5), while change 
scores for emotional symptoms and daytime function indicate 
a moderate change in QOL (change score of 
1.0-1.4). Preoperatively, the health-related QOL impact 
of the children’s sleep-disordered breathing was small for 
22 children (34%), moderate for 16 children (25%), and 
large for 26 children (41%) (Table 3). A highly significant 
change (P.001) was found in QOL postoperatively, 
where a small impact was found in 63 children 
(98%) and a moderate impact was found in 1 child (2%). 

Mean preoperative CBCL T scores and change in T

of the syndrome scales are applicable to only the CBCL/ 
2-3 or the CBCL/4-18, the total competence items are 
scored only for children aged 6 years and older, and 3 
CBCLs had incomplete responses for the total competence 
items and were excluded from the analysis. The 
mean total problem score was 7.3 points lower after surgery, 
resulting in a statistically significant decrease 
(P.001). Scores were significantly lower after surgery 
for the internalizing and externalizing subgroups and all 
but 2 of the individual syndrome scales (total competence 
and social problems). Preoperative and postopera

tive T score classifications are presented in Table 5. Although 
there were trends toward improvement, changes 
in classification were only significant for the total problem 
score and the individual problem scales of anxious 
or depressed, thought problems, and sleep problems. 

Since a number of socioeconomic variables have been 
shown to have a significant influence on children’s development,
14 we used analysis of variance to compare parent’s 
education level, family income, and patient sex with 
CBCL and OSA-18 results. There was no significant relationship 
between the 3 sociodemographic variables and 
the preoperative OSA-18 mean survey scores and change 
scores. There was also no significant relationship between 
family income and sex and the preoperative CBCL 
total problem, internalizing, and externalizing T scores, 
although the relationship between parent education level 
and the total problem and externalizing T scores approached 
significance (Table 6).

The correlation between the preoperative OSA-18 
health-related QOL impact scores and the preoperative 
CBCL total problem score classifications is presented in the 
Figure. All 22 children with an OSA-18 survey score indicating 
a small impact on QOL also had a CBCL total problem 
score in the normal range. Of the 16 children with a 
survey score indicating a moderate impact on QOL, 4 (25%) 
had a total problem score in the abnormal range. Of the 
26 children with a survey score indicating a large impact 
on QOL, 12 (46%) had a total problem score in the abnormal 
range. These results are highly significant (P.001). 

The OSA-18 preoperative mean survey scores had 
fair to good correlation with the preoperative CBCL total 
problem scores (r=0.50, P.001) and the internalizing 
(r=0.43, P.001) and externalizing (r=0.43, P.001) 
subgroups. The OSA-18 change scores had fair to good 
correlation with the change in CBCL total problem scores 
(r=0.54, P.001) and the internalizing (r=0.50, P.001) 
and externalizing (r=0.49, P.001) subgroups. About 
25% of the variations in one score could be explained by 
variations in the other. 

Because the influence of parent education level on 
CBCL scores approached significance by univariate analysis, 
a linear regression model was constructed to compare 
the preoperative OSA-18 mean survey score and parent’s 
education level as predictors of the total problem T 
score (Table 7). Although parents who were both high 
school and college graduates reported significantly lower 
total problem CBCL T scores than parents who did not 
finish high school, the mean OSA-18 score was a more 
significant predictor of CBCL results (P=.01 vs P.001).

line, or abnormal) were also statistically significant for 
the total problem score and some of the individual domains. 
Only 8% of the children scored in the abnormal 
range for the total problem score postoperatively. The 
health-related QOL impact of sleep-disordered breathing 
was large (41%) or moderate (25%) for our study 
population, and significantly improved postoperatively 
(66% vs 2%). The relationship between behavior and QOL 
was both static and dynamic, since both the baseline and 
the change scores demonstrated significant correlation. 

The CBCL results are similar to the results obtained 
in the pilot study by our group of 36 children undergoingT&
Afor treatment of chronic upper airway 
obstruction.3 Preoperatively, the total problem score was 
abnormal for 28% of the patients as compared with 25% 
in the present study. Individual syndrome scales most 
affected in both studies were total competence, sleep problems, 
and somatic complaints. The mean total problem 
score was 7.5 points lower 3 months postoperatively in 
the previous study (n=15) as compared with 7.3 points 
in the present study. Although changes in classification 
were not significant in the previous study after surgery, 
we were able to demonstrate significant postoperative 
changes in the total problem score, anxious or depressed, 
thought problems, and sleep problems in the 
present study, which may be attributed to our larger 
sample size (N=64). 

Sociodemographic variables including parental 
education, family income, and race or ethnicity have 
been shown to influence children’s developmental performance.
14 Boys also tend to score higher on the CBCL 
than girls.8,9 Only parental education level influenced 
the CBCL results, as parents who had not graduated 
from high school reported higher CBCL scores for their 
children than did parents who had graduated from high 
school or from college. The relationship between OSA-18 
QOL scores and CBCL scores, however, remained highly 
significant when adjusted for the confounding effect of 
parent education (Table 7). Together, the OSA-18 scores 
and parent education predicted 34% of the variance in 
CBCL scores. 

Although widely cited as a common complication 
of pediatric OSAS, behavioral disturbances have mostly 
been inferred from parental reports of children’s behavior 
before and after treatment. A few recent studies using 
standardized assessments have identified the presence 
of inattention, hyperactivity, memory problems, 
learning difficulties, and poor school performance in children 
with sleep-disordered breathing.1-4,7 Our study also 
identifies thought problems and attention problems in 
children with sleep-disordered breathing, but hyperactivity 
is not a problem scale on the CBCL. Although the 
physiological mechanism by which OSAS produces its 
neurocognitive and behavioral effects is unknown, disrupted 
sleep patterns and hypoxia are considered integral 
to their development.15,16 

The OSA-18 is the only QOL survey that has been 
validated as a discriminative measure of severity of pediatric 
sleep-disordered breathing and an evaluative measure 
of longitudinal change. The preoperative mean survey 
score and change score for our 64 patients were even 
greater than the scores obtained in the study performed 
to validate the responsiveness of the survey.11 In this previous 
study of 69 children undergoing tonsillectomy or 
adenoidectomy for the treatment of sleep-disordered 
breathing (78%) or recurrent tonsillitis (22%), the mean 
survey score was 3.1. The mean change score for the children 
with clinical evaluations suggestive of sleep-
disordered breathing was 1.14. Although not an objective 
measure of the severity of sleep-disordered breathing, 
such as polysomnography, the OSA-18, like other health-
related QOL surveys, focuses on the physical problems,

functional limitations, and emotional consequences of 
OSAS. The OSA-18 is more comprehensive in its scope 
than polysomnography. 

No child with an OSA-18 survey score demonstrating 
a small impact on QOL scored in the abnormal range 
on the CBCL total problem score. In contrast, 25% of children 
with an OSA-18 survey score demonstrating a moderate 
impact on QOL and 46% of children with a score 
demonstrating a large impact scored in the abnormal 
range. Fair to good correlation was found between the 
OSA-18 QOL and CBCL preoperative and change scores. 
Four items (22%) on the OSA-18 that evaluate the frequency 
of mood swings, aggression or hyperactivity, discipline, 
and inattention overlap with domains of the CBCL. 
Despite this overlap, the 2 survey instruments evaluate 
separate but related consequences of sleep-disordered 
breathing. 

This is, to our knowledge, the first prospective study 
of pediatric obstructive sleep apnea correlating children’s 
behavioral disturbances with QOL and documenting improvements 
in both after treatment using validated assessments. 
The major weakness is that “effectiveness” or “efficacy” 
cannot be inferred, since the study did not have a 
control group. Although improvements in both behavior 
and QOL occurred, we cannot be certain that they were 
the result of T & A. 

Our study provides further evidence that behavioral 
and emotional difficulties are present in children 
with sleep-disordered breathing and improve after treatment. 
Scores on our standardized assessment of behavior 
demonstrated significant correlation with scores on 
a validated QOL instrument. Additional work is needed 
to define the precise spectrum of behavioral abnormalities, 
elucidate their pathophysiologic mechanism, and provide 
diagnostic clues to allow their early recognition.
