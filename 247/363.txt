Impact of CPAP on asthmatic patients with 
obstructive sleep apnoea 

C. Lafond*, F. Se´rie`s# and C. Lemie`re* 
ABSTRACT: The impact of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment on the airway 
responsiveness of asthmatic subjects with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) has scarcely been 
studied. 

A prospective study was performed comparing the changes in airway responsiveness and 
quality of life in stable asthmatic OSA patients, before and 6 weeks after their nocturnal CPAP 
treatment. 

A total of 20 subjects (11 males and nine females) participated in the study. With the nocturnal 
CPAP treatment, the apnoea/hypopnoea index dropped from 48.1¡23.6?h-1 to 2.6¡2.5?h-1. There 
were no significant changes in airway responsiveness after CPAP treatment (provocative 
concentration causing a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1;PC20 

2.5 mg?mL-1 (1.4–4.5)) compared with baseline (PC20 2.2 mg?mL-1 (1.3–3.5)). There was no 
significant change in FEV1 either. However, the asthma quality of life of the subjects improved 
from 5.0¡1.2 at baseline to 5.8¡0.9 at the end of the study. 
In conclusion, nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure treatment did not alter airway 
responsiveness or forced expiratory volume in one second in subjects with stable mild-tomoderate 
asthma and newly diagnosed obstructive sleep apnoea. However, nocturnal continuous 
positive airway pressure treatment did improve asthma quality of life.

CPAP IN ASTHMATIC PATIENTS WITH OSA C. LAFOND ET AL. 

QOLAp questionnaires were completed. An atopic status was 
assessed using skin-prick tests to common inhalants. Gastrooesophageal 
symptoms and/or antireflux medication usage 
were assessed by way of open questionnaires. 

CPAP titration was completed during a full-night polysomnography 
(PSG). Afterwards, CPAP treatment was started at 
home. After the second and fourth week of nocturnal treatment 
with CPAP, patients were contacted by the research nurse to 
verify the control of their asthma and their adaptation to the 
CPAP treatment. 

After 6 weeks of nocturnal treatment with CPAP, objective 
CPAP utilisation was determined by downloading information 
from the CPAP unit. An in-laboratory PSG was repeated with 
CPAP therapy as prescribed at home. The airway responsiveness 
and QOLAs and QOLAp questionnaires were reassessed 
as performed at baseline. 

Subjects 

Individuals aged o18 yrs with stable asthma and a new 
diagnosis of OSA syndrome were considered for enrolment in 
two centres (Sacre-Coeur Hospital, Montreal and Laval 
Hospital, Quebec, QC, Canada) between October 2001 and 
March 2005. The study was approved by the research ethics 
committee of each participating centre. All subjects gave their 
written consent. 

Inclusion criteria 

Asthma was defined according to the American Thoracic 
Society (ATS) criteria [20]. Acceptable asthma control was 
defined by occasional respiratory symptoms and absence of 
asthma exacerbation without changes in the maintenance 
therapy in the month preceding the study. All subjects showed 
airway responsiveness defined by a provocative concentration 
of methacholine causing a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume 
in one second (FEV1) f8mg?mL-1 (PC20). 

All patients complained of symptoms suggestive of OSA 
syndrome and their apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI) was 
determined during one in-laboratory PSG, the recording of 
which was o15?h-1. 

Exclusion criteria 

Initially, subjects were not eligible to continue the study when 
the variation between the lowest and the highest measure of 
PC20 was more than two dilutions. This assumed that their 
asthma was not optimally controlled or that the methacholine 
challenge could not be reproduced in these patients. 

Withdrawal criteria 

No changes in the patients’ maintenance therapy for asthma 
were allowed during the study (which included changes in 
inhaled or systemic steroids, long-acting inhaled b2-agonists, 
theophylline or leukotriene receptor antagonists) nor were the 
addition of steroids in nasal vaporisation and/or medication 
against gastro-oesophageal reflux. 

Patients were withdrawn during the course of the study when 
compliance to their CPAP treatment was considered inadequate 
(average daily use ,4h?night-1) or when asthma 
exacerbations unrelated to CPAP use occurred (e.g. respiratory 
tract infection, allergenic exposure and recurrence of smoking). 

Methacholine challenges 

Spirometry was performed according to the ATS standards 
[21]. Methacholine challenges were performed according to 
previously described standardised techniques [22]. 

Sleep studies 

Initial PSG recordings consisted of in-laboratory continuous 
acquisition of electroencephalogram, electro-occulogram, sub-
mental electromyogram, arterial oxyhaemoglobin saturation 
by transcutaneous pulsed oxymetry, naso-oral airflow with 
thermistors, nasal pressure with nasal cannula, chest and 
abdominal movements by impedance plethysmography 
(RespitraceTM; Ambulatory Monitoring Inc., Ardsley, NY, 
USA), ECG and breathing sounds. Sleep position was 
continuously assessed by the attending technician using an 
infrared camera. All variables were digitally recorded 
(Sandman EliteTM System; Mallinckrodt, Kenilworth, NJ, 
USA). Sleep and respiratory variables were manually scored 
according to standard criteria [23]. 

During the CPAP titration sleep study, airflow was recorded 
via a pneumotachograph connected to a tightly fitting nasal 
CPAP mask. The titration procedure was manually completed 
by the attending technician, who adjusted the pressure level in 
order to abolish apnoeic and hypopnoeic obstructive events, 
snoring and inspiratory flow-limited events (effective pressure 
level). 

CPAP apparatus 

The units used at home (Fisher-Paykel, Auckland, New 
Zealand) were set at the effective pressure level. All the 
CPAP devices included a heated humidifier (ambient tracking), 
a ramp function and a micro-processor allowing for time 
of usage measurement. A nasal or a facial mask could be used. 

Quality-of-life questionnaires 

Validated QOLAs and QOLAp questionnaires were used [24, 
25]. Scores were reported on a scale of 1–7, with higher scores 
equating to better quality of life. The QOLAs questionnaire 
was divided into four sections: emotional function, environmental 
stimuli, symptoms and activity limitation. 

Data analysis 

All values were expressed as mean¡SD.PC20 values were log-
transformed and the mean of the three serial methacholine 
challenges before and after CPAP was calculated on this 
transformation to get one representative value before and after 
CPAP. Statistical results from PC20 before and after treatment 
were expressed with the log-transformed values as the 
geometric means (average of three individual geometric means 
before and after CPAP) and 95% confidence interval (CI). 
Different correlations were examined by a Spearman rank-
order test. Significance was accepted at the level of 95%. 

RESULTS 

In total, 33 patients were invited to participate in the study. Six 
were excluded due to the high variability of their PC20 results 
during the screening visits. Seven were withdrawn during the 
study due to CPAP use ,4h?night-1 (n53), an upper 
respiratory tract infection (n52), resumed smoking (n51) or 
elective orthopaedic surgery (n51). A total of 20 patients 
completed the study. The baseline characteristics of these

used CPAP with a nasal interface. The clinical and functional 
characteristics related to OSA and asthma before and 6 weeks 
after the CPAP treatment are summarised in table 2. 

No significant change in airway responsiveness before (PC20

(PC20 2.5 mg?mL-1 (1.4–4.5); p50.3; fig. 1a) was found. In three 
patients, a reduction of airway responsiveness was noticed 
after 6 weeks of CPAP, as reflected by a two-fold increase in 
PC20. Compared with the other patients, no differences were 
found in their age, effective CPAP pressure, CPAP compliance, 
BMI, AHI, gastric reflux, atopy or quality-of-life scores. 
However, their baseline PC20 was higher (7.3 mg?mL-1) than 
the subjects who did not have any change in airway 
responsiveness (1.7 mg?mL-1;p50.02). There were no significant 
changes in the mean FEV1 before (82.2¡13.6% predicted) 
and after 6 weeks of CPAP (80.4¡13.6% pred). The QOLAp 
statistically and clinically improved from 4.1¡1.4 at baseline to

improved statistically and clinically from 5.0¡1.2 at baseline to 
5.8¡0.9 at the end of the study (p50.001; fig. 1b). Clinical 
improvement for each QOL questionnaire is established by a 
score increase o0.5. The QOLAs at baseline were inversely 
correlated with the patient’s BMI (rho5-0.5, p50.02).

was positively correlated with the BMI (rho50.5, p50.03) and 
the AHI at baseline (rho50.5, p50.03).

between the changes in QOLAs and PC20. Following CPAP 
use, the BMI was correlated with the improvement of the 
emotional (rho50.5, p50.02) and the environmental (rho50.5, 
p50.01) domains of QOLAs. The AHI at baseline was 
correlated with the improvement of the symptomatic 
(rho50.6, p50.01), the emotional (rho50.6, p50.01) and the 
environmental (rho50.5, p50.05) domains of QOLAs. 

DISCUSSION 

It was found that nocturnal CPAP treatment used with a 
heated humidifier in patients with stable asthma and newly 
diagnosed OSA did not modify the respiratory functional 
parameters, such as PC20 or FEV1. Nevertheless, the CPAP 
treatment improved the QOLAs. This improvement was 
greater in obese patients and in patients with a high AHI at 
baseline. 

The present authors decided to enrol only stable asthmatic 
subjects in order to avoid potential variations in airway 
responsiveness related to poorly controlled asthma. Indeed, it 
must be remembered that the primary aim of the present study 

C. LAFOND ET AL. 
was to assess the effect of CPAP on airway responsiveness and 
not the control of asthma. 

A total of 20 subjects may appear to be quite a small sample 
size, but the present authors feel that it was enough to allow 
detection of a clinically significant change in PC20 with greater 
than two-fold dilutions after CPAP use to a 99% power, with 
an a-error of 5%. Therefore, it is believed that should a major 
effect of CPAP on airway responsiveness occur, the present 
study would have been able to detect it. 

The number of patients excluded due to insufficient use of 
nocturnal CPAP (three out of 23) is less than the CPAP dropout 
rate reported among OSA patients, since the acceptance 
rate of CPAP treatment among OSA patients, at large, is 
considered to be ,70–80% [26]. It is important to notice that 
patients had a heated humidifier integrated into their CPAP 
unit, thus preventing the effects of nasopharyngeal congestion 
in all but one subject. 

An important variability in PC20 (more than two methacholine 
dilutions) was found in six patients at baseline in spite of a 
clinically adequate control of asthma. These patients were 
excluded from the study. This exclusion criterion may explain 
the discrepancy between the present results and those from 
other studies, which found an improvement in PC20 after 
CPAP treatment [17, 18]. In those studies, PC20 was measured 
on one occasion before and one after CPAP treatment. 
Therefore, a spontaneous PC20 variability may have occurred, 
which could be unrelated to CPAP treatment. 

The lack of a control group comprising stable asthmatic 
patients without OSA prevents the present authors from 
concluding with certainty that the improvement of QOLAs 
following CPAP utilisation is specifically related to CPAP 
treatment. Indeed, this improvement may be due to other 
factors, such as a placebo effect of CPAP or improvement of 
adherence to asthma treatment during the study. The lack of 
correlation between the changes in QOLAs and QOLAp 
suggests that the improvement in QOLAs cannot be explained 
by an overall feeling of well-being consecutive to sleep 
normalisation following OSA treatment with CPAP. The 
interdependence of the questionnaires should not be completely 
excluded and should be addressed by experts in a future 
study. In a future larger study, additional analysis could 
possibly and more accurately determine whether BMI and AHI 
are independent contributors to QOLAs and its improvement 
with CPAP treatment. 

Further randomised controlled studies including moderate-tosevere 
asthmatic patients with and without obstructive sleep 
apnoea need to be conducted in order to assess the impact of 
continuous positive airway pressure on asthma quality of life 
and its control.
