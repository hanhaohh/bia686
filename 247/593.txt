Summary 
Sleep-disordered 
breathing; 
Child; 
Objective: 
Although first line therapy of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in children 
is adeno-tonsillectomy, the indications for this operation have not yet been clearly 
Adenoid-tonsillectomy; established. We investigated whether pulse-oximetry is useful for determining the 
Pulse-oximetry optional treatment modality for pediatric SDB. 
Method: 
Two hundred and thirty-two children presenting with snoring and gasping 
had their oxygen saturation levels examined during sleep. Among them, 86 underwent 
on adeno-tonsillectomy and were evaluated pre-and post-surgery. We also examined 
25 healthy children as controls. 
Results: 
Little desaturation was observed in healthy children. The difference in 
oxygen saturation levels of the patients between pre-and post-surgery was closely 
correlated with the pre-surgery levels. We examined the reaction operation characteristics 
and concluded that children with an oxygen desaturation index of 4% or 
more (ODI4) of more than 1.5 and/or ODI3 of more than 3.5 should undergo surgery. 
Conclusion: 
Pulse-oximetry is useful in determining the indications for adeno-tonsillectomy.

1. 
Introduction 
Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), such as obstructive 
sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), in children due to 
adenoid and tonsillar hypertrophy is a well-defined 
clinical entity and it is well-known to induce such 
sequelae as failure to thrive [1,2], neurocognitive 
abnormalities [3,4], systemic hypertension [5] and 
right heart failure including cor pulmonale [6,7]. Its 
symptoms are non-specific and widely variable and 
therefore performing physical examination and 
evaluating the patient history is of limited value 
[8,9]. Adeno-tonsillectomy (T&A) is known to 
relieve such conditions in most otherwise healthy 
cases [10—12], however, a number of studies have 
shown no relationship to exist between the presence 
of SDB and the size of the tonsils and adenoids [13— 
15]. Currently, polysomnography (PSG) is widely 
considered to be the gold standard in diagnosing 
SDBinchildhood [8,16].However,PSGisvery expensive, 
time consuming and not easy to carry out on 
children. As a result, we think that more simplified 
method is needed for such cases. 

Measuring hemoglobin oxygen saturation level 
witha pulse-oximeterisa verysimple,widely used 
method for the screening of sleep apnea syndrome 
[8,17—19].Brouilletteetal. comparedtheresultsof 
nocturnal pulse-oximetry with those of PSG and 
reported oximetry to be useful when the results 
were positive [8], but there have been only a few 
studiescomparing the results of pulse-oximetry with 
those of normal candidates, and no definite indication 
for T&A based on the severity of desaturation 
have not yet been established.We therefore examined 
the percutaneously measured hemoglobin oxygen 
saturation (SpO2) of children who were 
suspected to have SDB and then compared the 
results with those for healthy children, while also 
comparing the pre-and post-operative SpO2 of 
patients who underwent T&A. 

2. 
Subjects 
and 
methods 
2.1. 
Subjects 
We conducted a prospective study of all children 
between 1-year-old and 10-year-old that consulted 
the oto-rhino-laryngological clinic of Saiseikai Utsunomiya 
Hospital with such complaints as snoring, 
choking or gasping during sleep, oral breathing and 
other complaints that are usually associated with 
OSAS. Of these, 232 were evaluated by pulse-oximetry 
between April 1998 and July 2004. Because 
some children were evaluated several times, the 
total number of the tests was 535. When we exam


ined a child several times, we chose the data that 
had the longest study duration. Any children who 
were under 1-year of age, had lung disease, neuromuscular 
disorders, cranio-facial deformity, bilateral 
fixation of vocal cords and/or acute upper air 
way infection at the time of examination were 
excluded. 

Among them, 91 children underwent T&A. We 
examined the nocturnal pulse-oximetry findings of 
86 patients between2and5days after the surgery, 
and then compared the pre-and post-surgery 
values. Some children underwent the examinations 
several times and we also chose the result of longest 
examination after surgery for analysis. 

For the control group, healthy children who did 
not demonstrate snoring, nasal obstruction or oral 
breathing were recruited.Written informedconsent 
was obtained from parents of each child. 

2.2. 
Methods 
Each patient was admitted to our hospital and 
performed the examination twice because we were 
afraid of ‘first night effect’, but no children and 
their parents complained sleep disturbance during 
the examinations. 

Inthebeginningof the study,a nurse setNPB290 
on oneoffingersof a patient beforesheorhefell 
asleep and then the nurse confirmed that the 
patient had no complaints and the expressed value 
was equal to or more than 97%. If SpO2 was under 
97%, then thedatawereexcludedfromthisanalysis. 
Thereafter the patient fell asleep and the 
measurements were performed on all night long. 
The nurse recorded sleeping position and arousal 
events. 

T&A was performed by one of the authors. In the 
control group, we taught the parents how to use the 
device and then measurements were carried out at 
home in the same manner as described above. 

After the examination, the recorded data were 
downloaded and then were analyzed using the specific 
software (Score Software1, Nellcor Puritan 
Bennett, USA). 

2.3. 
Pulse-oximeter 
SpO2 was recorded using a NPB290 (Nellcor Puritan 
Bennett, USA) pulse-oximeter set at 5-s averaging. 
After the examinations the trend data were downloaded 
to a personal computer and then were evaluated 
using the Score software1. Motion artifacts 
were automatically eliminated by a default setting 
and one of the authors (H.S.) revised the trend 
graphs and excluded from analysis any unnatural 
steep changes that did not last for 10 s and drops in 


Pulse-oximetry in pediatric disordered breathing 

the SpO2 that did not accompany any changes in the 
heart rate which usually drops into brady during 
apnea and thereafter shows rapid increase [19]. 
The download and default evaluation completed 
withina minute, andit took30minto2h for revision. 
We chose the lowest saturation level (Low), 
the number of desaturation events per hour (ODI) 
and the total duration of desaturation per hour 
(TDD) as parameters. 

ForODI,weevaluated desaturationof >3% (ODI3) 
and >4% (ODI4), because the formeris the standard 
in adult OSAS evaluation [20] while the latter has 
been used in some pediatric OSAS studies [4]. 

For TDD, we evaluated the duration of desaturation 
below 95% (TDD95) and below 89%, but the TDD 
below 89% was not very useful in analyzing the 
sensitivity, and as a result, we herein only describe 
TDD95 results. 

2.4. 
Statistic 
analysis 
A comparison between the pre-and post-operative 
values of the parameters was done using the Mann— 
Whitney test and correlation studies were performed 
using the Spearman’s rank test. All statistical 
analyses were calculated using the ‘Statview 
SE1’ software package. 

3. 
Results 
We performed 535 examinations on 232 children. 
Five children were excluded from the analysis 
because of their physiological condition and 30 
examinations were excluded because of either an 
inadequate operation of the pulse-oximeter and/or 
malfunction(Table1). Consequently,we analyzed 
495 examinations of 225 children consisting of 144 
(64.3%) boys and 81 girls. The age of the patients 
ranged from 1-year and 5 months to 10-year old. 

As written previously, 86 children, 55 boys 
(64.0%) and 31 girls, were examined before and 
after T&A. The indications for the operation depend 
not only on the severity of desaturations but also on 
a relapse of inflammation, recurrent acute otitis

3.1. 
Pulse-oximetry 
result 
There were few cases showing desaturation in the 
control group (Table 2). We assumed that each 
parameter follows a normal distribution anddefined 
the cut-off line temporarily based on the 
mean+ 2S.D. (ODI3, ODI4 and TDD95) or 
mean . 
2S.D. (Low). 

The results of the patients are shown as histograms 
in Fig. 1. The values of Low, ODI3, ODI4 and 
TDD95 ranged from60to99,0 to 31.77,0 to 28.08 
and 0 to 3412, respectively. As a result, there was 
wide variety in desaturation, from normal to severe, 
inthepatientgroup.Thegreycolumnsin Fig.1 show 
the number of patients who were thought to be 
normal considering the cut-off line. Many patients, 
80 in Low, 76 in ODI3, 91 in ODI4 and 96 in TDD95, 
respectively, showed normal values.We noted that 
mode of each parameter existed near the cut-off 
value. 

After T&A, all patients showed significantly 
improved parameters (p 
< 
0.01), and the value 
of each parameterbeforethe surgery showstrong 
correlations, especially in ODI3, ODI4 and TDD95, 
with thedifferencebetween pre-andpost-surgery 
value(Fig.2). Consequently, theresultof surgery 
maybepredictable from thepulse-oximetric

Pulse-oximetry in pediatric disordered breathing 

metry [4,10,21]. In general, the role of pulse-oximetry 
in the diagnosis of pediatric sleep apnea is 
thought to be limited. Brouillette et al. [8] compared 
results of pulse-oximetrywiththose ofsimultaneous 
PSG and came to the conclusion that the 
oximetry was useful when the results were positive 
and he also noted that the children identified by 
pulse-oximetry testing are likely to have clinically 
significant disease severity. They also said that for 
children that tended to show positive finding on the 
oximetrytrend graph, no additional testing is necessary 
before performing T&A, and negative or inconclusive 
results require a subsequent PSG to rule out 
OSAS. 

Moreover, the interpretation of child PSG is controversial 
because the etiology of OSAS is complicated 
and there is little information about what 
types of event should be count and reliable for 
diagnosis. Even pulse-oximetry that is included in 
PSG, we do not have much information about normative 
range of parameters that are gotten with 
pulse-oximetry or what distribution of the value the 
SDB patients show. Therefore, to establish the normal 
range of pulse-oximeter, what distribution of 
value the patients shows and what kind of parameter 
should be suitable for evaluating SDB, is 
important and to establish the cut-off values based 
on the pulse-oximetric results between those that 
should be treated and those that do not needtreatment 
at once is desirable. We measured SpO2 in 
healthy children and they showed little desaturation. 
However, the mode of each parameter in 
children who were suspicious as OSAS was near 
the mean+ (or ) 2S.D. that was calculated from 
the results of healthy children. There might be many 
false positives and false negatives if we used it as 
cut-off line because even a small degree of error 
would affecta large numberof subjects.We therefore 
need some other criteria. 

In each parameter, the value before surgery 
showed a strong correlation with the differences 
in values between pre-and post-surgery, therefore 
whether the surgery results in success or not is 
considered to be predictable.We could obtain high 
success rate of 95% with high sensitivity more than 
90%. We thus propose that children with ODI3 of 
more than 3.5 and/or ODI4 of more than 1.5 should 
be treatedbyT&A.IftheirODI3islowerthan1.5and 
ODI4is lower than 3.5, they shouldbe examinedby 
some other procedure including PSG. 

When we use the pulse-oximetry, careful history 
taking and physical examinations are necessary to 
rule out neuromuscular disease that may cause 
central apnea and hypopnea and cardiopulmonary 
disease that may cause hypoxemia. The inadequate 
installation of the probe should also be avoided and 

it is important to confirmthe value after attachment 
to be higher than or equal to 97%. 

The oximetry results may be influenced by the 
algorithm to distinguish true desaturation from 
motion artifact. We think that physicians should 
investigate the trend graph and exclude any drops 
of SpO2 that are not associated changes in the heart 
rate. We set the averaging time at 5 s, but the 
assessment of oxygen desaturation is highly influenced 
by the setting of the averaging time. Farre 
et al. [22] examined how different setting of averaging 
time: 3, 6, 12 and 21 s, affected the oxygen 
desaturation results and reportedthat oxygen desaturationobtainedwhen 
averagingtimewassetat6 s 
was lower,though not significantly, than when it was 
setat3 s.Five secondsisthewidely usedsettingof 
averaging time, but further study may be necessary 
because the SpO2 in children and infants who have 
more rapid ventilation is thought to change faster 
than in adult. 

The cost-benefit analysis is beyond the scope of 
this study. But we can detect98 cases that fulfilled 
the indication of ODI3 for the T&A among 225. 
Therefore, along our criteria, we can omit 98 PSG 
examinations. Our study was not suitable for the 
cost-benefit analysis because the sample was not 
extracted randomly but from those with symptoms. 
But we guess that pulse-oximetrymight be economical 
because it is not so expensive as PSG and less 
time consuming. 

As far as we know, this is the first report to show 
the indications of treatment for pediatric OSAS 
using the pulse-oximetric parameters. Nocturnal 
pulse-oximetry is thus considered to be a useful 
diagnostic modality for pediatric OSAS.
