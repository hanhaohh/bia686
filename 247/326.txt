Objective: 
To 
determine 
the 
current 
practices 
of 
preoperative 
evaluation, 
surgical 
techniques, 
and 
postoperative 
treatment 
of 
pediatric 
adenotonsillectomy. 
Study 
Design: 
Forty-one-item 
survey 
measuring 
the 
frequency 
of 
different 
evaluations, 
procedures, 
and 
treatments 
performed, 
including 
selected 
case 
scenarios, 
with 
all 
items 
scored 
on 
a 
five-point 
ordinal 
scale 
ranking 
frequency. 
Methods: 
The 
entire 
membership 
of 
the 
American 
Society 
of 
Pediatric 
Otolaryngology 
(ASPO) 
and 
active 
fellows 
and 
members 
of 
the 
American 
Academy 
of 
Otolaryngology—Head 
and 
Neck 
Surgery 
(AAO–HNS) 
residing 
in 
New 
York 
state 
were 
anonymously 
surveyed 
through 
mail-in 
questionnaires. 
Results: 
History 
alone 
was 
the 
most 
frequent 
modality 
for 
diagnosing 
both 
adenoid 
enlargement 
and 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea. 
The 
most 
common 
preoperative 
laboratory 
test 
ordered 
before 
an 
adenotonsillectomy 
is 
a 
complete 
blood 
cell 
count; 
ASPO 
members 
ordered 
fewer 
preoperative 
laboratory 
tests 
than 
AAO– 
HNS 
members. 
Unipolar 
cautery 
is 
the 
most 
frequently 
used 
tonsillectomy 
technique, 
and 
curettage 
followed 
by 
cautery 
is 
the 
most 
popular 
adenoidectomy 
technique. 
Steroids 
are 
the 
most 
common 
intraoperative 
medication 
administered 
during 
an 
adenotonsillectomy, 
and 
office 
visits 
remain 
the 
most 
frequently 
used 
methods 
of 
assessing 
adenotonsillectomy 
patients 
postoperatively. 
Conclusions: 
Although 
there 
are 
statistically 
significant 
trends 
uncovered 
by 
the 
survey, 
the 
results 
reflect 
a 
lack 
of 
consensus 
regarding 
adenotonsillectomy 
management. 
Further 
randomized 
controlled 
trials 
or 
large-scale 
outcomes 
projects 
are 
much 
needed 
to 
evaluate 
critically 
the 
current 
practices 
of 
pediatric 
adenotonsillectomies. 
Additional 
efforts 
may 
also 
be 
required 
to 
use 
the 
information 
from 
these 
studies 
in 
effecting 
changes 
in 
actual 
practice 
patterns,

INTRODUCTION 


There 
exists 
a 
multitude 
of 
reports 
in 
the 
literature 
lauding 
the 
benefits 
of 
one 
adenotonsillectomy 
(T&A) 
management 
scheme 
compared 
with 
another. 
How 
those 
studies 
translate 
into 
what 
otolaryngologists 
actually 
do 
in 
practice, 
however, 
remains 
to 
be 
established. 
We 
designed 
the 
present 
study 
to 
determine 
the 
current 
practices 
of 
preoperative 
evaluation, 
surgical 
techniques, 
and 
postoperative 
treatment 
of 
pediatric 
adenotonsillectomies. 


MATERIALS 
AND 
METHODS 


A 
41-item 
survey 
was 
constructed 
after 
an 
extensive 
literature 
review 
as 
well 
as 
consultations 
with 
experts 
in 
the 
field. 
Each 
item 
was 
scored 
on 
a 
five-point 
ordinal 
scale 
ranking 
frequency 
from 
1 
(never) 
to 
5 
(always). 
Practitioners 
were 
asked 
to 
assess 
the 
frequency 
with 
which 
they 
practiced 
each 
survey 
item 
in 
their 
routine 
clinical 
activity. 
The 
survey 
was 
intentionally 
kept 
brief 
to 
allow 
for 
rapid 
completion, 
thereby 
potentially 
maximizing 
the 
response 
rates. 


The 
survey 
was 
mailed 
to 
two 
separate 
cohorts 
of 
practitioners: 
the 
mailing 
addresses 
of 
the 
219 
members 
of 
the 
American 
Society 
of 
Pediatric 
Otolaryngology 
(ASPO) 
and 
the 
mailing 
addresses 
of 
the 
485 
active 
fellows 
and 
members 
(practicing 
otolaryngologists) 
of 
the 
American 
Academy 
of 
Otolaryngology—Head 
and 
Neck 
Surgery 
(AAO–HNS) 
residing 
in 
New 
York 
state. 
The 
mailing 
list 
for 
the 
latter 
group 
was 
manually 
cross-checked 
to 
avoid 
sending 
repeat 
surveys 
to 
those 
already 
included 
in 
the 
ASPO 
group. 


The 
completed 
surveys, 
which 
were 
coded 
for 
cohort 
type 
(ASPO 
vs. 
AAO–HNS), 
were 
anonymously 
mailed 
back 
in 
self-
addressed 
stamped 
envelopes. 
The 
response 
data 
were 
entered 
in 
a 
computer 
database 
and 
verified 
for 
accuracy. 
Statistical 
analysis 
was 
performed 
using 
Excel 
2000 
and 
SPSS 
10.0 
software. 


RESULTS 


Of 
the 
AAO-HNS 
members, 
202 
of 
485 
returned 
surveys, 
for 
a 
41.6% 
response 
rate; 
142 
of 
219 
APSO 
members 
returned 
them, 
for 
a 
64.8% 
response 
rate. 
Thus, 
the 
overall 
survey 
response 
rate 
was 
344 
of 
704 
(48.9%). 


In 
response 
to 
the 
questions 
regarding 
the 
preoperative 
diagnosis 
of 
adenoid 
enlargement 
(Table 
I), 
AAOHNS 
members 
used 
history 
significantly 
more 
often

significantly 
more

than

In 
contrast, 
ASPO 
members 
used 
the 
three 
modalities 
with 
equal 
frequency. 


In 
the 
preoperative 
diagnosis 
of 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
(OSA), 
history 
alone 
was 
the 
most 
common 
method 
in 
both 
groups 
(Table 
II). 
Both 
groups 
also 
used 
sleep 
studies 
and 
sleep 
tapes 
to 
a 
lesser 
extent. 
Members 
of 
AAO–HNS 
used 
more 
sleep 
studies 
than 
sleep 
tapes; 
ASPO 
members 
used 
them 
both 
with 
equal 
frequency. 
Members 
of 
AAO– 
HNS 
used 
sleep 
studies 
more 
frequently 
than 
APSO 
members 
did, 
whereas 
ASPO 
members 
used 
sleep 
tapes 
more 
frequently 
than 
AAO–HNS 
members 
did. 


Table 
III 
shows 
the 
results 
from 
questions 
regarding 
the 
preoperative 
laboratory 
testing 
for 
children 
without 
suspected 
bleeding 
diathesis 
who 
will 
undergo 
T&A. 
Although 
a 
complete 
blood 
cell 
count 
(CBC) 
was 
the 
most 
common 
laboratory 
test 
ordered 
in 
both 
groups, 
it 
was 
far 
more 
common 
among 
the 
AAO–HNS 
members 
(more 
than 
half 
the 
respondents 
always 
require 
it) 
than 
among 
ASPO 
members. 
Also, 
there 
were 
significantly 
more 
AAO–HNS 


members 
ordering 
coagulation 
studies 
(prothrombin 
times 
and/or 
activated 
partial 
thromboplastin 
times) 
than 
there 
were 
ASPO 
members 
ordering 
them; 
in 
the 
latter 
group, 
more 
than 
half 
the 
respondents 
never 
ordered 
them. 
Neither 
group 
ordered 
bleeding 
times 
or 
blood 
bank 
screens 
substantially. 


Unipolar 
cautery 
was 
the 
most 
popular 
technique 
employed 
for 
tonsillectomies 
(Table 
IV). 
The 
“cold 
knife” 
technique 
was 
used 
more 
frequently 
among 
AAO–HNS 
members 
than 
among 
ASPO 
members. 
Neither 
groups 
used 
other 
techniques 
(eg, 
bipolar 
cautery, 
harmonic 
scalpel, 
laser) 
frequently. 
Many 
respondents 
reported 
methods 
other 
than 
those 
listed, 
more 
commonly 
among 
the 
ASPO 
members. 
These 
additional 
techniques 
included 
(in 
descending 
order 
of 
frequency): 
debrider, 
coblation, 
snare, 
guillotine, 
shaver, 
bipolar 
scissors, 
tonsillotome, 
suction 
cautery, 
and 
the 
electric 
snare. 


Curettage 
followed 
by 
cautery 
was 
the 
most 
popular 
adenoidectomy 
technique 
employed 
(Table 
V). 
In 
descending 
order 
of 
frequency, 
ASPO 
members 
also 
used

Antibiotics 
were 
used 
sometimes 
by 
both

again 
more 
commonly 
by 
ASPO 
members. 
Neither 
group 
reported 
frequent

Other 
responses 
from 
both

topical 
antihistamines, 
intramuscular 
antibiotics, 
and 
topical 
oxymetazolam.

regarding 
the 
observation 
period 
before 
discharge

contained 
three 
items: 
2 
hours 
of 
observation, 
6 
hours 
of 
observation, 
and 
overnight 
observation 
(Table

For 
these 
items, 
more 
of 
the

and

who 
reported

of

Many 
responses 
included 
patient 
age, 
institutional 
policies, 
and 
distance 
from 
the 
hospital 
as 
determining 
the 
length 
of 
the 
observation 
period. 


For 
children 
with 
OSA, 
significantly 
more 
patients 
were 
sent 
to 
the 
floor 
overnight 
than 
were 
sent 
home 
the 
day 
of 
surgery 
(Table 
VIII). 
Overnight 
intensive 
care 
unit 
(ICU) 
stays 
were 
less 
frequent 
in 
both 
groups, 
but 
not 
significantly 
so. 


Table 
IX 
shows 
the 
frequency 
of 
dietary 
instructions 
for 
the 
first 
week 
following 
a 
T&A. 
Members 
of 
AAO–HNS 
recommended 
soft 
diet 
significantly 
more 
often 
than 
liquids, 
with 
more 
than 
half 
the 
respondents 
never 
recommending 
“no 
change.” 
ASPO 
members, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
recommended 
soft 
diet 
and 
no 
dietary 
changes 
with 
overlapping 
frequency; 
more 
than 
half 
the 
ASPO 
respondents 
never 
recommended 
a 
liquid 
diet. 


In 
assessing 
T&A 
patients 
postoperatively, 
office 
visits 
were 
the 
modality 
used 
most 
commonly 
(Table 
X). 


Significantly 
more 
ASPO 
members 
used 
telephone 
follow-up 
compared 
with 
AAO–HNS 
members. 


Two 
brief 
case 
presentations 
were 
included 
in 
the 
survey. 
In 
managing 
a 
child 
with 
OSA 
and 
enlarged 
adenoids, 
but 
with 
small 
tonsils, 
most 
respondents 
would 
perform 
adenoidectomy 
rather 
than 
a 
T&A 
(Table 
XI). 
Nonetheless, 
more 
than 
half 
of 
each 
group 
would 
sometimes 
perform 
a 
T&A. 
In 
managing 
a 
child 
with 
symptomatically 
large 
adenoids 
and 
incidentally 
large 
tonsils, 
most 
respondents 
would 
also 
perform 
an 
adenoidectomy 
more 
often 
than 
a 
T&A 
(Table 
XII). 
However, 
when 
the 
two 
survey 
groups 
were 
compared, 
significantly 
more 
ASPO 
members 
would 
perform 
just 
an 
adenoidectomy, 
and 
significantly 
more 
AAO–HNS 
members 
would 
perform 
a 
T&A. 


DISCUSSION 


The 
present 
study 
reflects 
the 
variability 
among 
practitioners 
regarding 
the 
diagnosis 
and 
management 
of 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
(UAO) 
and

apnea 
(OSA). 
A 
literature 
search 
did 
not 
find 
a 
comparable 
survey 
to 
date. 


The 
most 
common 
modality 
for 
the 
preoperative 
diagnosis 
of 
adenoid 
enlargement 
among 
our 
respondents 
was 
the 
patient’s 
history 
(Table 
I). 
The 
literature 
supports 
the 
diagnosis 
of 
adenoid 
enlargement 
by 
history 
alone 
to 
be 
effective 
when 
the 
history 
is 
extremely 
weak 
or 
extremely 
strong.1 
Other 
diagnostic 
modalities 
include 
fiber-
optic 
examination 
and 
lateral 
neck 
x-ray 
films. 
Wang 
et 
al.2 
noted 
that 
the 
flexible 
fiberoptic 
examination 
provided 
more 
information 
that 
a 
lateral 
skull 
radiograph 
and 
avoided 
unnecessary 
irradiation. 


The 
majority 
of 
our 
respondents 
diagnosed 
OSA 
by 
history 
alone 
(Table 
II). 
History 
alone 
has 
been 
validated 
as 
a 
sensitive 
diagnostic 
tool 
for 
the 
diagnosis 
of 
OSA.3 
Although 
the 
sleep 
study 
has 
been 
considered 
the 
gold 
standard 
for 
the 
diagnosis 
of 
OSA, 
cost-effectiveness 
has 
limited 
many 
practitioners 
in 
its 
use. 
Polysomnography 
is 
most 
useful 
for 
diagnosing 
high-risk 
patients,4 
young 
children 
less 
than 
2 
years 
of 
age, 
morbidly 
obese 
patients, 
patients 
with 
unconvincing 
history, 
and 
those 
with 
con


traindications 
for 
T&A 
who 
may 
be 
candidates 
for 
continuous 
positive 
airway 
pressure 
treatment.5 


The 
most 
common 
laboratory 
test 
ordered 
before 
performing 
a 
T&A 
was 
a 
CBC 
(Table 
III). 
Many 
practitioners, 
including 
less 
that 
than 
half 
of 
the 
ASPO 
members, 
never 
order 
testing 
for 
prothrombin 
time/partial 
thromboplastin 
time. 
The 
preoperative 
coagulation 
profile 
has 
been 
well 
studied, 
and 
numerous 
studies 
have 
shown 
that 
no 
additional 
information 
other 
than 
a 
bleeding 
history 
is 
necessary 
for 
the 
general 
pediatric 
population 
and 
that 
a 
PT/PTT 
should 
be 
preformed 
only 
in 
selected 
cases.6,7 
The 
preoperative 
test 
for 
PT/PTT 
has 
a 
low 
positive 
predictive 
value 
in 
detecting 
occult 
bleeding 
disorders 
and 
does 
not 
appear 
to 
be 
cost-effective.8 


The 
most 
common 
technique 
used 
by 
our 
respondents 
for 
tonsillectomy 
was 
unipolar 
cautery 
(Table 
IV). 
Prospective 
studies 
have 
shown 
that 
this 
technique 
is 
fast 
and 
results 
in 
little 
intraoperative 
bleeding; 
however, 
patients 
still 
have 
postoperative 
hemorrhages 
and 
may 
have 
prolonged 
postoperative 
pain 
compared 
with 
cold 
dissection 
techniques.9 


Adenoid 
curette 
followed 
by 
cautery 
was 
the 
most 
common 
technique 
performed 
by 
our 
respondents 
for 
adenoidectomy 
(Table 
V). 
Clemens 
et 
al.10 
compared 
electrocautery 
versus 
curette 
adenoidectomy, 
determining 
that 
the 
estimated 
blood 
loss 
was 
lower 
with 
electrocautery 
without 
any 
difference 
in 
postoperative 
results 
or 
complications. 
The 
microdebrider 
in 
a 
prospective 
randomized 
trial 
was 
shown 
to 
result 
in 
a 
faster, 
dryer, 
and 
more 
complete 
resection 
of 
the 
adenoids 
compared 
with 
adenoid 
curette 
adenoidectomy.11 


The 
most 
common 
and 
statistically 
significant 
intraoperative 
medication 
used 
by 
our 
respondents 
was 
steroids 
(Table 
VI).

have 
shown 
that 
a 
dose 
of 
intraoperative 
steroids 
decreases 
morbidity 
by 
decreasing 
vomiting 
in 
the 
first 
24 
hours 
and 
advancing 
the 
patient 
more 
quickly 
to 
soft 
or 
solid 
diet 
by 
the 
first 
postoperative 
day.12,13 
Its 
routine 
use 
in 
T&A 
is 
safe 
and 
cost-effective.13 
The 
use 
of 
intraoperative 
nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory 
drugs 
remains 
controversial. 
The 
studies 
have 
all 
been 
retrospective, 
some 
finding 
no 
increase 
in 
post-tonsillectomy 
hemorrhage 
and 
decrease 
in 
length 
of 
hospital 
stay,14 
with 
others 
finding 
increased 
incidence 
of 
postoperative 
bleeding 
complications.15,16 
Intraoperative 
antibiotics 
have 
been 
shown 
to 
reduce 
pain, 
halitosis, 
and 
fever, 
as 
well 
as 
promote 
an 
earlier 
return 
to 
diet.17 
A 
randomized, 
double-blind, 
placebo-controlled 
study 
of 
adults 
demonstrated 
reduced 
halitosis, 
earlier 
return 
to 
activities, 
and 
no 
difference 
in 
pain 
with 
intraoperative 
intravenous 
antibiotics 
followed 
by 
postoperative 
oral 
antibiotics.18 
Similar 
studies 
using 
children 
are 
still 
needed 
to 
determine 
the 
efficacy 
of 
intraoperative 
intravenous 
antibiotics 
in 
that 
age 
group. 


The 
majority 
of 
our 
respondents 
are 
performing 
adenotonsillectomies 
as 
ambulatory 
procedures. 
Many 
studies 
have 
compared 
the 
time 
and 
rate 
of 
occurrence 
of 
complications 
in 
the 
postoperative 
T&A 
patient 
to 
determine 
a 
consensus 
on 
when 
to 
discharge 
the 
patient 
to 
home. 
There 
is 
no 
higher 
rate 
of 
complications 
if 
a 
patient 
is 
discharged 
after 
3 
hours19,20 
or 
4 
hours21 
following 
a 
T&A 
compared 
with 
6 
hours. 
Patient 
age 
is 
also 
an 
issue; 
surgery 
in 
carefully 
selected 
children 
less 
than 
3 
years 
of 
age 
can 
be 
performed 
in 
the 
ambulatory 
setting.22 


Most 
of 
our 
respondents 
(AAO-HNS 
members 
more 
so 
than 
ASPO 
members) 
placed 
postoperative 
T&A 
patients 
on 
dietary 
restrictions 
following 
surgery 
(Table 
IX). 
Studies 
have 
shown 
no 
significant 
differences 
in 
any 
aspect 
of 
recovery 
between 
restricted 
and 
nonrestricted 
diets 
postoperatively.23,24 


The 
majority 
of 
our 
respondents 
conducted 
a 
postoperative 
office 
visit 
following 
T&A, 
with 
APSO 
respondents 
being 
significantly 
more 
likely 
to 
conduct 
a 
postoperative 
follow-up 
by 
telephone 
(Table 
X). 
Roshe 
et 
al.25 
performed 
a 
prospective 
study 
and 
determined 
that 
a 
follow-up 
telephone 
call 
is 
a 
safe 
and 
cost-effective 
method 
of 
postoperative 
evaluation, 
without 
compromising 
patient 
care. 


CONCLUSION 


Although 
there 
are 
statistically 
significant 
trends 
uncovered 
by 
the 
present 
survey, 
the 
results 
reflect 
a 
lack 
of 
consensus 
regarding 
managing 
adenotonsillectomies. 
Further 
randomized 
controlled 
trials 
or 
large-scale 
outcomes 
projects 
are 
much 
needed 
to 
evaluate 
critically 
the 
current 
practices 
of 
pediatric 
adenotonsillectomies. 
Additional 
efforts 
may 
also 
be 
required 
to 
use 
the 
information 
from 
these 
studies 
in 
effecting 
changes 
is 
actual 
practice 
patterns, 
moving 
us 
toward 
a 
more 
evidence-based 
paradigm 
of 
treating 
pediatric 
adenotonsillar
