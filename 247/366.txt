Objective: To determine the safety of a relatively brief 
(,3-hour) period of postoperative observation prior 
to discharge in children undergoing outpatient tonsillectomy. 


Design: Retrospective chart review. 

Setting: Tertiary care children’s hospital and public 
teaching hospital. 

Patients: The records of all patients (12 years of age who 
underwent tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy from November 
1995 through July 1997 were reviewed. A total 
of 143 patients scheduled for ambulatory treatment were 
identified; 9 were excluded owing to insufficient follow-
up. The remaining 134 patients made up the study group. 

Main Outcome Measures: (1) Duration of observation 
prior to discharge; (2) complication rates. 

Results: The mean age of the study population was 

6.1 ± 2.6 (mean ± SD) years. Obstructive sleep apnea was 
an indication for surgery in 86.5%. Eleven (8.2%) of 134 
planned outpatients were electively admitted from the recovery 
room for inpatient observation, most often because 
of respiratory compromise. Patients admitted from 
the recovery room were significantly younger (mean age, 

4.0 years) than those who were discharged as planned (6.3 
years, P,.001). One hundred twenty-three patients were 
discharged from the recovery room as anticipated, following 
a mean ± SD duration of postoperative observation of 
144 ± 48 minutes. Overall, 5 (4.1%) of these 123 outpatients 
suffered complications after discharge. Two patients 
(1.6%) experienced primary bleeding, both at 8 hours 
after surgery. Four patients (3.2%) were readmitted. The 
complication rate did not vary significantly with the duration 
of postoperative observation (P = .71). 
Conclusion: A short postoperative observation period 
is safe, with a low rate of complications, in appropriately 
selected children scheduled for ambulatory tonsillectomy.

N THE LAST DECADE, children 
undergoing tonsillectomy and 
adenotonsillectomy have increasingly 
been treated on an ambulatory 
basis. While outpatient 
treatment has been documented to be safe 
for appropriately selected patients,1-4 the 
optimum length of postoperative observation 
before discharge has not clearly been 
established. Ideally, patients should be observed 
for a sufficient period to minimize 
complications, while maximizing the cost-
effective use of healthcare resources. 

As we have gained experience with 
ambulatory tonsillectomy at our institutions, 
we have been encouraged to gradually 
decrease the length of postoperative 
observation before discharge. At present, 
it is our practice to perform tonsillectomy 
in children for both obstructive and 
inflammatory indications without a fixed 
mandatory minimum observation pe


riod. Because we commonly discharge patients 
far earlier than 6 hours after surgery, 
the goal of the present study was to 
determine the safety and efficacy of our 
relatively brief (,3-hour) observation period 
compared with the standard observation 
periods (#6 hours) reported in the 
literature. 

RESULTS 
Of the 134 patients in the study group, 50 
(37.3%) were female and 84 (62.7%) were 
male, with a mean ± SD age of 6.1 ± 2.6 
years (median age, 5.7 years; age range, 
0.9-12.6 years) (Figure 1). Twenty-
nine patients (21.6%) were 3 years of age 
or younger. Evidence of obstructed breathing, 
including OSAS, was the primary indication 
for surgery in 96 patients (71.6%), 
with an additional 20 patients (14.9%) un-

PATIENTS AND METHODS 

All patients 12 years of age or younger who underwent 
tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy at Lucile 
Salter Packard Children’s Hospital at Stanford, Stanford, 
Calif (a tertiary care children’s hospital), and 
Santa Clara Valley Medical Center, San Jose, Calif (a 
public teaching hospital), from November 1995 
through July 1997 were identified through a search 
of operating room databases. The records of 189 patients 
thus identified were retrospectively reviewed. 
All patients scheduled for ambulatory treatment were 
eligible for inclusion. Fifty-four patients were excluded; 
46 owing to planned inpatient admission (24% 
of the total population), and 9 owing to insufficient 
follow-up. Inpatient admission was elected according 
to individual physician judgment, most commonly 
for significant coexisting illnesses (such as severe 
asthma, developmental delay, cerebral palsy or 
hypotonia, morbid obesity, seizure disorder, or a history 
of organ transplantation), evidence of severe sleep 
apnea, social issues, or occasionally for age 3 years 
or younger. Neither age 3 years or younger nor obstructive 
sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) was considered 
an absolute indication for inpatient treatment. 
The remaining 134 patients scheduled for ambulatory 
treatment made up the study group. 

The following data were extracted from the records 
of study patients: age, sex, presence of associated 
medical conditions, indication for surgery, surgical 
technique, and duration of postoperative 
observation (time from admission to the recovery room 
[RR] until discharge from the hospital). In one hospital, 
patients were discharged directly from the RR, 
while in the other, the total duration of observation 
included a period of observation in the ambulatory surgical 
unit (ASU) prior to discharge. The incidence of 
unplanned admission from the RR, as well as the 
incidence of postoperative complications after discharge, 
was noted. Charts were reviewed for evidence 
of bleeding, respiratory events, emesis, or insufficient 
oral intake requiring an emergency 
department visit or readmission to the hospital. Data 
were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The significance 
of differences between groups was evaluated 
using the Student t test. 

dergoing surgery for the combined indications of obstructed 
breathing and tonsillitis. Tonsillitis without evidence 
of obstruction was the indication for surgery in 11 
patients (8.2%). 

One hundred twenty-two children (91.0%) underwent 
adenotonsillectomy, and 12 (9.0%) underwent tonsillectomy 
alone. Electrodissection tonsillectomy was performed 
in 88 cases (65.7%), while 46 patients (34.3%) 
underwent sharp dissection tonsillectomy according to 
individual surgeon preference. Adenoidectomies were performed 
with a curette. Hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery 
and nasopharyngeal packs. With occasional 
exception, procedures were performed by resident surgeons 
with attending supervision. Forty-six patients

(34.3%) received an intravenous antibiotic, and 61 
(45.5%) received intravenous dexamethasone before surgery, 
most commonly at a dose of approximately 0.5 mg/ 
kg. All patients were discharged on a regimen of oral antibiotics, 
most commonly amoxicillin. 

Eleven (8.2%) of 134 planned outpatients required 
an unscheduled inpatient admission based on clinical assessment 
in the RR, including 7 (24%) of 29 patients 3 
years of age or younger.

Conversion to inpatient status was most frequently 
prompted by respiratory events, including apnea, de-
saturation, and/or stridor (7 patients [5%]). Respiratory 
compromise occurred in 4 (14%) of 29 patients 3 years 
of age or younger, but in only 3 (3%) of 105 children older 
than 3 years. All patients experiencing airway complications 
had a preoperative diagnosis of OSAS. Once discharged 
from the hospital, none of these patients experienced 
further complications. 

Patients admitted from the RR were significantly 
younger (mean age, 4.0 ± 1.6 years) than those who were 
discharged as planned (6.3 ± 2.6 years, P,.001). While 
1 patient had an additional underlying diagnosis of mild 
asthma, there were no complicating medical illnesses in 
the remainder of these patients. There were no differences 
in operative technique, steroid use, or indication 
for surgery in patients requiring unscheduled admission 
as compared with the outpatient group as a whole. 

One hundred twenty-three patients (91.8%) were 
discharged as anticipated, including 22 (76%) of 29 patients 
3 years of age or younger. Patients were discharged 
when fully awake, with stable vital signs and without 
evidence of bleeding, ongoing emesis, or airway signs 
or symptoms. There was no requirement for a specific 
length of observation or for demonstration of oral in-

take before discharge. The duration of postoperative observation 
for the patients in the RR/ASU ranged from 55 
to 310 minutes (mean ± SD, 144 ± 48 minutes [2.4 ± 0.8 
hours]) (Figure 2). Observation time in the RR/ASU was 
occasionally prolonged by nonclinical factors, such as 
transportation and medication delays. 

Patients in the outpatient group were followed up 
after surgery for 30 ± 44 (mean ± SD) days. Five (4.1%) 
of these 123 outpatients suffered complications (Table). 
Four patients (3.2%) were readmitted to the hospital after 
discharge from the RR/ASU. Two patients experienced 
primary bleeding, for a rate of 1.6%. No patients 
experienced secondary bleeding. Among patients initially 
discharged as planned, the incidence of emesis and/or 
inadequate oral intake requiring readmission or an emergency 
department visit was 2.4%. No respiratory complications 
were noted after discharge. 

The duration of postoperative observation in the RR/ 
ASU did not vary significantly between patients with and 
without complications (157 ± 76 minutes vs 143 ± 46 minutes, 
respectively, P = .71). While patients who suffered 
a complication tended to be somewhat older than patients 
whose course was uncomplicated (8.2 ± 2.4 years 
vs 6.2 ± 2.5 years), this difference was not statistically significant 
(P = .14). There were no complications in patients 
3 years of age or younger after discharge from the 
RR/ASU. 

COMMENT 
Ambulatory management has become the standard of care 
for many children undergoing tonsillectomy and adenotonsillectomy. 
Since Chiang et al5 reported in 1968 on 
40 000 cases of outpatient tonsillectomy with little morbidity 
and no mortality, numerous other authors have 
documented the safety and cost-effectiveness of this approach.
1-4 However, there has been ongoing and justifiable 
concern regarding what constitutes an adequate period 
of postoperative observation before discharge. Based 
on a retrospective study of 2600 inpatient tonsil and adenoid 
procedures, Carithers et al6 in 1987 recommended 
that patients should be observed for 8 to 10 hours 
after surgery. Subsequent studies suggest that many authors 
consider a minimum postoperative observation period 
of 6 to 8 hours to be standard.2,3,7-9

There are few studies in the literature suggesting that 
shorter periods of observation may be equally safe. Mitchell 
et al10 and Gabalski et al11 have suggested that posttonsillectomy 
observation may be safely reduced to 4 hours. In 
a retrospective study, Colclasure and Graham4 reported a 
complication rate of 1.4% among 3340 children and adults 
observed for an average of 2.25 hours after tonsil and adenoid 
procedures. Finally, Nicklaus et al12 reported a retrospective 
series involving 233 children who underwent 
ambulatory tonsillectomy, with a mean postoperative observation 
period of 136 ± 48 minutes, and an overall complication 
rate of 9%, including primary and secondary bleeding 
(1.7% and 3.0%, respectively), nausea and vomiting 
(2.5%), and dehydration (1.3%). The incidence of complications 
after discharge from the hospital was 4.3%. While 
Nicklaus and colleagues concluded that short periods of 
observation are safe and cost-effective, letters of response 
to their article were highly critical of this approach.13,14 

The current article provides additional support for 
the safety and efficacy of a short period of postoperative 
observation in ambulatory pediatric adenotonsillectomy. 
The average length of observation in our study of 144 ± 48 
minutes is nearly identical to that reported by Colclasure 
and Graham4 and Nicklaus et al.12 Although retrospective 
and modest in size, our overall outpatient complication 
rate of 4.1% confirms our clinical impression of 
excellent clinical outcomes. Specific complications will 
be discussed in turn. 

Postoperative hemorrhage is clearly the most dangerous 
potential complication after adenotonsillectomy. 
In the present series, 2 patients had primary hemorrhages, 
for a rate of 1.6%, with spontaneous resolution 
in 1 case. Our experience compares favorably with the 
primary hemorrhage rates of 0.006% to 4.2% reported 
in the literature for large series of patients observed for 
a minimum of 6 hours after surgery.4-6,8,9 Without question, 
careful patient selection, with attention to the availability 
of transportation and proximity to the hospital, 
is critical to the safety of ambulatory adenotonsillectomy, 
regardless of the length of observation. 

Refractory or problematic emesis has been reported 
in 1.1% to 10.0% of patients after adenotonsillectomy.
3,4,6,8,9,12,15 Poor oral intake and/or dehydration occurs 
in 0.05% to 1.9% of patients in all age groups,2,4,7,8,12 
but may be as high as 4.0% to 9.7% in children 3 years of 
age or younger.10,16 For purposes of the present study, emesis 
and poor oral intake were recorded as complications

when they were sufficient to prompt an emergency department 
visit or readmission to the hospital. The 2.4% incidence 
of emesis and poor oral intake recorded for patients 
discharged as anticipated, prompting readmission in 1.6%, 
is well within the range outlined in the literature. Including 
2 additional patients admitted from the RR for vomiting, 
overall 5 (3.7%) of 134 patients scheduled for ambulatory 
management experienced problematic emesis and/or 
poor oral intake after surgery. 

The incidence of respiratory compromise reported after 
adenotonsillectomy varies greatly. While some authors 
have noted respiratory complications in as few as 0% 
to 0.4% of their patients,6,8,12 Gerber et al17 reported a rate 
of 15.1% in pediatric patients undergoing adenotonsillectomy 
for obstructive as well as inflammatory indications. 
Higher rates of respiratory complications have been noted 
in patients with OSAS documented by polysomnogram 
(23%-27%)18,19 and in children 3 years of age or younger 
(7%-52%),15-17,19,20 leading some authors to recommend admission 
for very young children and those with OSAS. 
Clearly, patients with postoperative respiratory compromise 
are best treated in the inpatient setting. It is less clear, 
however, whether all patients deemed to be at increased 
risk for airway complications should be scheduled for a 
planned postoperative admission. Reports of respiratory 
compromise in the literature do not note whether difficulties 
are evident in the early postoperative period, or whether 
problems were first noted many hours after surgery in a 
patient who was otherwise doing well. 

It has been our clinical impression that those children 
who experience respiratory difficulties are readily 
identified early, while asleep in the RR and still under 
the effects of various anesthetic and analgesic agents. It 
has therefore been our practice to schedule a majority 
of children, notwithstanding age or diagnosis of OSAS, 
for ambulatory surgery. Those who experience respiratory 
difficulties in the RR (5.2% in this series) are admitted 
for inpatient care as required. In agreement with 
the findings of others,15-17,19,20 children aged 3 years or 
younger in our study had a higher rate of respiratory compromise 
(13.8%) than did those older than 3 years (2.8%). 

With respect to unplanned admission to the hospital, 
a total of 8.2% of children initially scheduled as outpatients 
were admitted from the RR, and an additional 3.2% 
of patients were readmitted following RR discharge. Other 
authors have reported similar unplanned admission rates 
for pediatric adenotonsillectomy.7,10 The rate of admission 
from the RR is not related to the length of observation, 
but should be attributed to complications of the procedure 
itself. We believe that the low postdischarge 
complication rate of 4.1% for patients released from the RR/ 
ASU as planned reflects the safety and efficacy of our management 
practices. This postdischarge complication rate is 
virtually identical to that reported by Nicklaus et al12 (4.3%). 

Our approach to outpatient adenotonsillectomy is 
not only safe, but has resulted in significant cost savings 
as well. The current charge for routine RR care at our institutions 
is $38 to $39.90 per 15 minutes. An average 
uncomplicated RR stay of 2.5 hours, compared with 6 
hours, results in a savings of $504 to $559 per child. Thus, 
for the 123 outpatients cared for over the period of this 
study, RR charges were reduced by at least $61 990. 

CONCLUSIONS 
The mean duration of observation following ambulatory 
adenotonsillectomy in this study was 144 ± 48 minutes. 
Young age and sleep-disordered breathing were associated 
with some increased risk; nonetheless, respiratory 
complications were identified early, and the majority of 
children in these categories were successfully treated on 
an outpatient basis. Our posttonsillectomy management 
protocol is associated with a low rate of complications 
that compares favorably with the complication rates 
reported in the literature for standard observation periods 
of 6 hours or more. While the length of observation 
may vary for individual patients, our study confirms that 
a relatively short period of postoperative observation is 
both safe and cost-effective for selected children undergoing 
ambulatory adenotonsillectomy.
