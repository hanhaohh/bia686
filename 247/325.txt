Objective: 
To 
determine 
the 
role 
of 
adenoidectomy 
without 
concurrent 
tonsillectomy 
in 
the 
treatment 
of 
upper 
airway 
obstruction, 
by 
determining 
rates 
and 
risk 
factors 
for 
subsequent 
tonsillectomy. 


Design: 
Retrospective 
cohort 
study 
with 
nested 
case-
control 
study. 
Data 
were 
evaluated 
using 
Kaplan-Meyer 
curves 
with 
Cox 
proportional 
hazards 
regression 
analysis, 
as 
well 
as 
contingency 
table 
and 
logistic 
regression 
analysis. 


Setting: 
Tertiary 
care 
pediatric 
hospital 
with 
satellite 
clinics 
and 
surgical 
centers. 


Patients: 
A 
total 
of 
2462 
patients 
aged 
5 
months 
to 
18 
years 
undergoing 
adenoidectomy 
without 
concurrent 
tonsillectomy. 


Main 
Outcome 
Measures: 
A 
5-year 
database 
was 
searched 
for 
birth 
dates, 
dates 
of 
initial 
surgery, 
and 
dates 
of 
subsequent 
tonsillectomy 
(if 
performed) 
or 
latest 
follow-
up. 
Cases 
(tonsillectomies) 
were 
then 
matched 
1:1 
by 
age 
with 
controls 
(no 
subsequent 
tonsillectomy). 
Medi


cal 
charts 
were 
reviewed 
to 
identify 
potential 
predisposing 
factors, 
including 
sex, 
tonsil 
size, 
and 
adenoidectomy 
or 
tonsillectomy 
indication. 


Results: 
Within 
5.4 
years, 
108 
patients 
underwent 
subsequent 
tonsillectomy. 
The 
relative 
risk 
of 
subsequent 
tonsillectomy 
decreases 
by 
0.83 
(95% 
confidence 
interval, 
0.78-0.88) 
for 
each 
increasing 
year 
of 
age 
at 
adenoidectomy. 
The 
odds 
of 
undergoing 
a 
future 
tonsillectomy 
significantly 
increase 
with 
increasing 
tonsil 
size 
at 
the 
time 
of 
adenoidectomy. 
There 
was 
a 
trend 
toward 
doubling 
the 
risk 
of 
subsequent 
tonsillectomy 
when 
the 
adenoids 
were 
removed 
for 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
(including 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea) 
compared 
with 
other 
indications 
(P=.06). 


Conclusion: 
Knowledge 
of 
the 
rates 
and 
risk 
factors 
for 
subsequent 
tonsillectomy 
will 
allow 
more 
informed 
counseling 
of 
parents 
regarding 
whether 
tonsillectomy 
should 
be 
performed 
or 
deferred 
at 
the 
time 
of 
an 
indicated 
adenoidectomy.

ONSILLECTOMIES 
AND 
ADenoidectomies 
are 
2 
of 
the 
most 
common 
surgical 
procedures 
performed. 
In 
1996, 
there 
were 
274000 
adenotonsillectomies 
(T&As), 
144 
000 
tonsillectomies 
(without 
adenoidectomy), 
and 
136 
000 
adenoidectomies 
(without 
tonsillectomies) 
performed 
in 
the 
United 
States.1 
The 
surgical 
treatments 
to 
remove 
pharyngeal 
lymphoid 
tissue 
are 
often 
performed 
for 
symptoms 
of 
upper 
airway 
obstruction. 
However, 
it 
is 
not 
always 
clinically 
evident 
to 
the 
otolaryngologist 
whether 
a 
tonsillectomy 
should 
be 
performed 
or 
whether 
an 
adenoidectomy 
alone 
will 
suffice. 


This 
raises 
the 
question 
of 
what 
is 
the 
role 
of 
adenoidectomy 
without 
concurrent 
tonsillectomy 
in 
the 
treatment 
of 
upper 
airway 
obstruction. 
The 
goal 
of 
this 


study 
was 
to 
take 
some 
initial 
steps 
in 
answering 
that 
question, 
by 
determining 
rates 
of 
subsequent 
tonsillectomy 
when 
adenoidectomy 
is 
performed 
and 
by 
identifying 
underlying 
risk 
factors 
for 
needing 
a 
subsequent 
tonsillectomy. 


METHODS
The 
initial 
data 
set 
of 
patients 
was 
established 
as 
a 
retrospective 
cohort. 
The 
billing 
records 
of 
the 
Children’s 
Hospital 
of 
Pittsburgh 
were 
searched 
from 
December 
1997 
to 
May 
2003. 
The 
search 
was 
conducted 
using 
Current 
Procedural 
Terminology 
codes.2 
Patients 
were 
included 
if 
they 
had 
undergone 
code 
42830 
(primary 
adenoidectomy, 
younger 
than 
12 
years) 
or 
42831 
(primary 
adenoidectomy, 
12 
years 
or 
older). 
They 
were 
excluded 
if 
they 
had 
undergone 
the 
following 
procedure 
on 
the 
same 
date: 
42820

42825 
(primary 
or

younger 
than 
12 
years), 
or 
42826 
(primary 
or 
secondary 
tonsillectomy, 
12 
years 
or 
older). 
The 
records 
were 
further 
searched 
to 
determine 
which 
patients 
underwent 
tonsillectomy 
at 
a 
later 
date, 
by 
searching 
for 
codes 
42820, 
42821, 
42825, 
and 
42826 
performed 
after 
the 
adenoidectomy. 


A 
database 
was 
constructed 
that 
included 
each 
patient’s 
date 
of 
birth, 
date 
of 
adenoidectomy, 
and 
date 
of 
tonsillectomy, 
if 
performed. 
Analysis 
was 
performed 
using 
tonsillectomy 
as 
the 
failure 
event. 
Kaplan-Meier 
curves 
were 
constructed 
to 
summarize 
the 
time 
to 
tonsillectomy. 
Hazard 
ratios 
were 
calculated, 
and 
a 
Cox 
proportional 
hazards 
regression 
analysis 
was 
performed 
to 
identify 
risk 
factors. 


The 
second 
part 
of 
the 
inquiry 
involved 
a

During 
the 
5.4 
years 
examined 
in 
this 
study, 
2462 
pa


tients 
underwent 
adenoidectomy 
without 
concurrent 
ton


sillectomy. 
Their 
ages 
at 
the 
time 
of 
surgery 
were 
5 
months 
to 
18 
years, 
which 
were 
skewed 
toward 
the 
younger 
ages, 
with 
a 
median 
age 
of 
5.3 
years 
and 
a 
mean±SD 
age 
of 
5.9±3.2 
years. 
By 
age 
category, 
162 
patients 
were 
younger 
than 
2 
years, 
967 
were 
2 
to 
4 
years, 
812 
were 
5

7 
years, 
and 
521 
were 
older 
than 
7 
years. 
The 
duration 
of 
follow-
up 
was 
as 
long 
as 
5.4 
years, 
with 
a 
median 
of 
2.0 
years 
and 
a 
mean±SD 
of 
2.4±1.5 
years. 
The 
duration 
of 
follow-
up 
was 
similar 
for 
all 
age 
categories 
(P.05). 


Of 
the 
2462 
patients, 
108 
underwent 
subsequent 
tonsillectomy. 
These 
consisted 
of 
19 
children 
younger 
than 
2 
years 
at 
the 
time 
of 
adenoidectomy, 
61 
aged 
2 
to 
4 
years, 
23 
aged 
5 
to 
7 
years, 
and 
5 
older 
than 
7 
years 
(P.001, 
test 
for 
trend 
of 
odds). 


The 
overall 
incidence 
rate 
for 
tonsillectomy 
was 
2.0% 
(95% 
confidence 
interval 
[CI], 
1.6%-2.4%) 
per 
year. 
The 
rates 
for 
each 
age 
category 
can 
be 
seen 
in 
Table 
1, 
and 
the 
time 
to 
undergoing 
a 
tonsillectomy 
is 
summarized 
in 
Figure1. 
The 
time 
to 
tonsillectomy 
in 
the 
4 
age 
groups 
was 
significantly 
different 
(P.001, 
log-rank 
test 
for 
equality 
of 
survivor 
functions). 
When 
age 
was 
considered 
as 
a 
continuous 
covariate 
in 
the 
Cox 
proportional 
hazards 
regression 
model, 
it 
was 
highly 
significant, 
and 
the 
estimated 
decrease 
in 
relative 
risk 
was 
0.83 
(95% 
CI, 
0.780.88) 
for 
each 
increasing 
year 
of 
age 
(up 
to 
18 
years). 


Abbreviation: OSA, obstructive sleep apnea; UAO, upper airway 
obstruction.

Of 
the 
196 
patients 
in 
the 
nested 
case-control 
study, 
102 
underwent 
a 
subsequent 
tonsillectomy 
(cases), 
while 
94 
did 
not 
(controls). 
Their 
descriptive 
characteristics 
regarding 
sex 
and 
surgical 
indications 
are 
presented 
in 
Table 
2. 
Surgical 
indications 
for 
adenoidectomy 
were 
not 
mutually 
exclusive. 
Seventy-eight 
percent 
had

on 
the

grading 
assigned 
by 
the 
treating 
otolaryngologist 
at 
the 
time

The

had 
a

score 
at 
the 
time 
of 
adenoidectomy 
of 
2+, 
with 
a 
mean 
of 
1.7 
(95%

cases

median 
score 
of 
2.5, 
with 
a 
mean 
of 
2.3 
(95% 
CI, 
2.0-2.5). 


The 
odds 
of 
undergoing 
a 
future 
tonsillectomy 
significantly 
increase 
with 
increasing 
tonsil 
size 
at 
the 
time 
of 
adenoidectomy, 
as 
shown 
in 
Table 
3. 
A 
logistic 
regression 
analysis 
shows 
that 
each 
increase 
in 
tonsil 
size 
by 
1 
(eg, 
from 
2+ 
to 
3+) 
raises 
the 
risk 
of 
subsequent 
tonsillectomy 
by 
1.6 
times 
(95% 
CI, 
1.2-2.1 
times; 
P.001); 
no 
other 
variables 
changed 
the 
risk 
significantly. 


The 
measured 
tonsil 
sizes 
at 
the 
time 
of 
tonsillectomy 
had 
a 
median 
of 
3.5 
and 
a 
mean 
of 
3.5 
(95% 
CI, 
3.3-3.5). 
The 
magnitudes 
of 
the 
changes 
in 
tonsil 
size 
from 
the 
time 
of 
adenoidectomy 
to 
tonsillectomy 
appeared 
to 
be 
normally 
distributed, 
and 
this 
was 
supported 
by 
the 
failure 
of 
the 
Wilks-Shapiro 
test 
to 
find 
significant 
deviations 
from 
normality. 
Patients’ 
tonsils 
size 
increased 
on 
average 
by 
1 
size 
(eg, 
from 
2+ 
to 
3+), 
with 
a 
median 
increase 
of 
1 
(range, 
1-4) 
and 
a 
mean 
increase 
of 
1.2 
(95% 
CI, 
0.9-1.4). 
The 
magnitude 
of 
changes 
was 
unrelated 
to 
the 
indications 
for 
the 
tonsillectomies 
(upper 
airway 
obstruction 
[including

other). 
This

in

during 
a

of 
17 
months 
(range, 
2

COMMENT
This 
study 
demonstrates 
that 
younger 
children 
undergoing 
an 
adenoidectomy 
without 
concurrent 
tonsillectomy 
are 
more 
likely 
than 
older 
patients 
to 
undergo 
a 
subsequent 
tonsillectomy. 
The 
rate 
of 
future 
tonsillectomy 
significantly 
decreases 
with 
increasing 
age 
at 
adenoidectomy; 
28.7% 
of 
children 
younger 
than 
2 
years 
at 
the 
time 
of 
adenoidectomy 
will 
have 
a 
tonsillectomy 
within 
5 
years, 
while 
only 
2.0% 
of 
patients 
older 
than 
7 
years 
will. 
Although 
the 
rates 
of 
tonsillectomy 
are 
statistically 
unrelated 
to 
the 
adenoidectomy 
indication, 
there 
appears 
to 
be 
a 
trend 
toward 
doubling 
the 
risk 
for 
patients 


with 
upper 
airway 
obstruction, 
including 
OSA 
(P=.06). 
It 
is 
anticipated 
that 
this 
result 
would 
have 
reached 
statistical 
significance 
with 
a 
larger 
sample 
size 
for 
the 
nested 
case-control 
study. 
The 
risks 
of 
subsequent 
tonsillectomy 
significantly 
increase 
with 
increasing 
tonsil 
size 
at 
the 
time 
of 
adenoidectomy 
(P.001), 
with 
the 
risk 
growing 
by 
1.6 
times 
for 
each 
unit 
increase 
of 
tonsil 
size 
(eg, 
from 
2+ 
to 
3+). 
Also, 
the 
tonsil 
sizes 
for 
patients 
needing 
subsequent 
tonsillectomy 
increased 
over 
time, 
growing 
at 
a 
mean 
rate 
of 
0.8 
per 
year, 
with 
the 
growth 
rate 
being 
unrelated 
to 
the 
tonsillectomy 
indication. 


The 
role 
of 
adenoidectomy 
without 
concurrent 
tonsillectomy 
in 
the 
treatment 
of 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
remains 
an 
enigma. 
A 
recent 
survey 
of 
704 
pediatric 
and 
general 
otolaryngologists 
with 
344 
respondents 
(48.9%) 
addressed 
current 
trends 
in 
T&A.3 
In 
managing 
a 
child 
with 
OSA, 
enlarged 
adenoids, 
but 
small 
tonsils, 
most 
respondents 
would 
perform 
an 
adenoidectomy 
rather 
than 
a 
T&A. 
Nevertheless, 
more 
than 
half 
of 
the 
respondents 
in 
each 
group 
would 
still 
sometimes 
perform 
a 
T&A. 
In 
managing 
a 
child 
with 
symptomatically 
large 
adenoids 
and 
incidentally 
large 
tonsils, 
most 
respondents 
would 
also 
perform 
an 
adenoidectomy 
more 
often 
than 
a 
T&A. 
However, 
when 
the 
2 
survey 
groups 
were 
compared, 
significantly 
more 
American 
Society 
of 
Pediatric 
Otolaryngology 
members 
would 
perform 
an 
adenoidectomy 
alone, 
and 
significantly 
more 
American 
Academy 
of 
Otolaryngology–
Head 
and 
Neck 
Surgery 
members 
would 
perform 
a 
T&A. 
Further 
prospective 
trials 
are 
therefore 
warranted 
to 
shed 
light 
on 
these 
clinical 
challenges. 


There 
is 
only 
one 
similar 
study 
in 
the 
English 
literature, 
conducted 
in 
1962 
by 
Young.4 
That 
study 
involved 
a 
cohort 
of 
609 
patients 
who 
were 
evaluated 
6 
to 
9 
years 
after 
undergoing 
an 
adenoidectomy 
without 
concurrent 
tonsillectomy. 
Of 
those 
patients, 
68 
needed 
a 
subsequent 
tonsillectomy. 
Based 
on 
survey 
response 
data, 
5 
additional 
tonsillectomies 
were 
presumed 
to 
have 
been 
performed, 
for 
an 
estimated 
73 
total 
tonsillectomies, 
or 
a 
12.0% 
risk. 
This 
value 
is 
higher 
than 
the 
overall 
rate 
of 
4.4% 
in 
our 
study, 
which 
may 
reflect 
changing 
trends 
over 
time 
(as 
we 
are 
more 
conservative 
regarding 
performing 
tonsillectomies 
compared 
with 
1962 
practice), 
the 
increased 
age 
of 
this 
cohort 
compared 
with 
ours, 
or 
the 
longer 
overall 
follow-up 
in 
the 
study 
by 
Young. 


Twenty-nine 
patients 
in 
the 
study 
by 
Young 
underwent 
tonsillectomy 
within 
2 
years 
of 
their 
adenoidectomy.
4 
In 
examining 
this 
subset 
of 
patients, 
the 
author 
noted 
the 
following 
symptoms 
at 
the 
time 
the 
adenoidectomies 
were 
scheduled: 
5 
patients 
had 
sore 
throats; 
7 
had 
large, 
red, 
or 
exudative 
tonsils; 
and 
2 
had 
both 
symptoms. 
Of 
the 
609 
patients, 
203 
(33.3%) 
were 
younger 
than 
6 
years 
at 
the 
time 
of 
adenoidectomy, 
of 
whom 
48 
(23.6%) 
underwent 
subsequent 
tonsillectomy; 
among 
the 
406 
older 
children 
(66.7%), 
20 
(4.9%) 
underwent 
subsequent 
tonsillectomy. 
This 
is 
similar 
to 
our 
study, 
in 
which 
the 
younger 
patients 
had 
higher 
tonsillectomy 
rates. 
In 
our 
study, 
41.8% 
of 
the 
patients 
were 
younger 
than 
6 
years, 
of 
whom 
6.1% 
had 
a 
subsequent 
tonsillectomy, 
while 
58.2% 
were 
older, 
with 
a 
1.9% 
tonsillectomy 
rate. 


The 
interval 
between 
the 
adenoidectomy 
and 
subsequent 
tonsillectomy 
in 
the 
study 
by 
Young4 
was 
known 
for 
only 
65 
patients. 
The 
range 
was 
8 
months 
to 
7 
years

and

For 
children 
younger 
than 
6 
years, 
26.7% 
(12/ 
45) 
of 
Young’s 
patients 
underwent 
tonsillectomy 
within 
2 
years, 
compared 
with 
76.1% 
of 
our 
patients. 
For 
the 
older 
patients, 
40.0% 
(8/20) 
of 
Young’s 
patients 
underwent 
tonsillectomy 
within 
2 
years, 
compared 
with 
80.2% 
in 
our 
study. 
The 
earlier 
performance 
of 
tonsillectomy 
in 
the 
present 
study 
may 
reflect 
the 
shorter 
overall 
follow-
up 
of 
5.4 
years 
vs 
up 
to 
9 
years 
in 
the 
study 
by 
Young. 


Strengths 
of 
the 
present 
study 
include 
its 
large 
sample 
size 
and 
systematic 
methods, 
in 
addition 
to 
data 
evaluation 
using 
Kaplan-Meier 
analysis 
rather 
than 
incidence 
methods 
only 
(as 
we 
are 
dealing 
with 
censored 
data). 
Weaknesses 
of 
the 
study 
include 
that 
we 
have 
only 
5 
years 
of 
follow-up 
data; 
therefore, 
we 
cannot 
make 
conclusions 
regarding 
tonsillectomy 
rates 
beyond 
5 
years. 
Indications 
for 
the 
initial 
adenoidectomy 
are 
only 
known 
for 
the 
196 
patients 
whose 
medical 
charts 
were 
reviewed 
and 
not 
for 
the 
entire 
2462 
patients 
in 
the 
analysis. 
Tonsil 
sizes 
in 
our 
study 
are 
treated 
as 
continuous 
rather 
than 
ordinal 
data, 
although 
for 
large 
data 
sets 
ordinal 
data 
may 
be 
analyzed 
as 
if 
they 
were 
continuous.5 
Finally, 
although 
our 
institution 
and 
its 
satellites

undergoing 
adenoidectomy 
without 
concurrent 
tonsillectomy, 
with 
a 
0.21% 
hemorrhage 
rate 
and 
no 
transfusions, 
external 
carotid 
artery 
ligations, 
or 
deaths. 


If 
we 
knew 
when 
it 
would 
suffice 
to 
perform 
an 
adenoidectomy 
alone 
without 
a 
concurrent 
tonsillectomy, 
we 
would 
greatly 
reduce 
the 
risks 
of 
postoperative 
morbidity. 
Conversely, 
if 
we 
knew 
when 
a 
tonsillectomy 
should 
be 
performed 
at 
the 
initial 
surgery, 
we 
would 
reduce 
the 
morbidity 
of 
a 
second 
general 
anesthesia 
and 
of 
untreated 
tonsillar 
disease. 
This 
study 
suggests 
that 
tonsillectomy 
should 
be 
deferred 
in 
older 
patients 
with 
small 
tonsils, 
as 
the 
risks 
of 
requiring 
a 
secondary 
procedure 
are 
low.

Previous 
Presentation: 
This 
study 
was 
presented 
in 
part 
at 
the 
19th 
Annual 
Meeting 
of 
the 
American 
Society 
of 
Pediatric 
Otolaryngology; 
May 
2004; 
Phoenix, 
Ariz. 


only 
pediatric 
centers 
in 
the 
region, 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
patients 
underwent 
a 
subsequent 
tonsillectomy 
at 
another 
facility. 
The 
rates 
we 
report 
are 
therefore 
likely 
underestimates 
of 
the 
true 
rates 
in 
the 
general 
population. 


Adenoidectomy 
is 
a 
much 
safer 
procedure 
than 
tonsillectomy. 
In 
a 
cohort 
of 
200 
children, 
there 
was 
twice 
the 
risk 
of 
incident 
morbidity 
and 
complications 
in 
patients 
undergoing 
T&A 
compared 
with 
adenoidectomy 
without 
concurrent 
tonsillectomy.6 
Adenoidectomy 
has 
been 
shown 
to 
have 
a 
markedly 
lower 
hemorrhage 
rate 
than 
tonsillectomy.7 
In 
the 
latter 
study, 
among 
6794 
patients 
undergoing 
tonsillectomy 
(with 
or 
without 
adenoidectomy), 
2.94% 
experienced 
hemorrhage, 
with 
0.07% 
requiring 
transfusions, 
0.1% 
undergoing 
external 
carotid 
artery 
ligation, 
and 
0.007% 
resulting 
in 
death. 
This 
contrasts 
with 
the 
7785 
patients 
in 
the 
same 
study
