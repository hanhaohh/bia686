Objectives 
To compare neuropsychological and psychosocial function in children with a history of snoring, children with 
a history of behavioral sleep problems (BSP), children with both a history of snoring and BSP, and a group of control subjects. 

Study 
design 
Families awaiting consultation for ‘‘sick’’ visits in 5 general practice clinics completed the Sleep Disturbance 
Scale for Children. A subset of children were categorized into groups: Snorers (n = 11), BSP (n = 13), Snorers+BSP (n = 9), 
and controls (n = 31). Children underwent psychological (Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, Children’s Memory 
Scale; Test of Everyday Attention and Auditory Continuous Performance Test) and psychosocial assessment (Child Behavior 
Checklist). 

Results 
With analysis of variance, it was revealed that, compared with children in the BSP and control groups, those in the 
Snorers+BSP and Snorers groups showed reduced intelligence and attention scores. By contrast, compared with children in the 
Snorers and control groups, children in the Snorers+BSP and BSP groups reported reduced social competency, increased 
problematic behavior, and reduced memory scores. Children in the combination of Snorers+BSP group showed more deficits 
than children in all other groups. 

Conclusion 
In children, snoring and BSP, separately and together, are associated with impaired neuropsychological and 
psychosocial functioning. Furthermore, snoring and BSP are related to performance in disparate ways. Snoring was associated 
with intelligence and attention deficits, whereas BSP was associated with memory and behavioral deficits. (J

(BSP). 
Children 
with 
a 
disruption 
of 
sleep 
architecture3,15 
or 
whose 
sleep 
was 
experimentally

were 
reported

to 
better 
understand 
the 
impact 
of 
sleep 
disruption 
on 
neuropsychological 
and 
psychosocial

is 
to 
compare

and 
BSP 
(reported 
in 
15%-41% 
of

The 
aim 
of 
this 
study 
was 
to 
assess 
the 
neuropsychological 
and 
psychosocial 
function 
in 
children 
whose 
parents 
report 
varying 
levels 
of 
sleep 
disturbance: 
children 
who 
snore, 
children 
with 
BSP, 
children 
with 
both 
snoring 
1BSP, 
and 
control 
subjects. 


METHODS 


Subjects 


As 
part 
of 
a 
larger 
8 
month 
study, 
19 
parents 
of 
children 
aged 
0 
to 
16 
years 
who 
were 
awaiting 
consultation 
for 
‘‘sick’’ 
visits 
were 
asked 
by 
medical 
staff 
at 
5 
demographically 
similar 
general 
practices 
in 
South 
Australia 
to 
complete 
the 
Sleep 
Disorders 
Scale 
for 
Children 
(SDSC).23 
As 
estimated 
with 
clinic 
records 
of 
average 
weekly 
attendance, 
the 
percentage 
of 
all 
visiting 
parent/child 
pairs 
who 
actually 
completed 
the 
survey 
at 
the 
5 
general 
practices 
ranged 
from 
19% 
to 
34% 
(mean, 
26.4%). 
This 
figure 
was 
limited 
by 
the 
availability 
of 
busy 
reception 
staff 
to 
approach 
parent/child 
pairs. 
Although 
exact 
figures 
were 
not 
available, 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
approximations 
of 
reception 
staff 
and 
returned 
questionnaires, 
we 
estimate 
that 
90% 
of 
attendees 
participated. 
From 
the 
total 
sample 
(n 
= 
645), 
school-aged 
children 
aged 
6 
to 
16 
years 
(n 
= 
361) 
who 
matched 
our 
inclusion 
criteria 
(n 
= 
166) 
were 
invited 
to 
participate 
in 
neuropsychological 
and 
psychosocial 
assessment. 
Inclusion 
was 
based 
on 
the 
parent’s 
responses 
(with 
the 
child’s 
response 
when 
age 
appropriate) 
on 
the 
SDSC 
at 
the 
time 
of 
consultation 
to 
the 
snoring 
item 
(see 
question 
1) 
and 
items 
from 
the 
Disorders 
of 
Initiating 
and 
Maintaining 
Sleep 
factor 
(referred 
to 
as 
BSP; 
see 
questions 
2-8): 
1) 
Does 
your 
child 
snore?; 
2) 
How 
many 
hours 
does 
your 
child 
sleep 
on 
most 
nights?; 
3) 
How 
long 
after 
going 
to 
bed 
does 
your 
child 
get 
to 
sleep?; 
4) 
Does 
your 
child 
go 
to 
bed 
reluctantly?; 
5) 
Does 
your 
child 
have 
difficulty 
getting 
to 
sleep?; 
6) 
Does 
your 
child 
feel 
anxious 
or 
disturbed 
when 
falling 
asleep?; 
7) 
Does 
your 
child 
wake 
up 
more 
than 
twice 
per 
night?; 
and 
8) 
After 
waking 
up 
at 
night, 
does 
your 
child 
have 
difficulty 
in 
falling 
back 
to 
sleep? 
Response 
options 
for 
questions 
1 
and 
4 
through 
8 
were 
on 
a 
Likert 
scale 
(1 
= 
never, 
2 
= 
occasionally 
[#1-2 
times 
per 
month], 
3 
= 
sometimes 
[#1-2 
times 
per 
week], 
4 
= 
often 
[$3-5 
times 
per 
week], 
5 
= 
always). 
Items 
2 
through 
8 
were 
summed 
to 
formulate 
a 
BSP 
raw 
score, 
which 
was 
converted 
to 
a 
T-score 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
normative 
data.23 


Exclusion 
Criteria 


Children 
whose 
parents 
answered 
yes 
to 
the 
question, 
‘‘Does 
your 
child 
have 
any 
illness 
or 
disability 
(either 
physical 
or 
mental)?’’ 
(n 
= 
25), 
were 
excluded, 
because 
of 
potential 
confounders 
with 
cognitive 
functioning 
or 
behavior. 
Sixteen 
children 
could 
not 
be 
contacted, 
28 
withdrew 
before 
testing, 
and 
14 
did 
not 
attend 
the 
testing 
session. 
These 
58 
children 
were 
of 
the 
same 
age 
range 
and 
from 
the 
same 
demographic 
area 
as 
the 
participating 
sample. 
To 
ensure 
that 
the 
final 
subject 
sample 
would 
only 
include 
children 
who 
were 
displaying 
chronic 
sleep 
problems 
that 
were 
persistent 
during 
the 
study 
period, 
we 
excluded 
children 
whose 
parents 
reported 
different 
SDSC 
scores 
at 
initial 
completion 
from 
those 
completed 
at 
the 
time 
of 
testing 
from 
the 
data 
set 
(n 
= 
5; 
mean 
[SD] 
test 
– 
retest 
time 
= 
153 
[76.5] 
days; 
range, 
15-300 
days). 
To 
maximize 
comparison 
effects, 
23 
children 
with 
BSP 
and 
snoring 
scores 
in 
the 
borderline 
ranges 
(according 
to 
normative 
data) 
were 
excluded. 
Specifically, 
for 
BSP, 
T 
scores 
<60 
were 
classified 
as 
non-BSP, 
T-scores 
>67 
were 
classified 
as 
BSP, 
and 
children 
with 
T 
scores 
from 
60 
to 
67 
were 
excluded 
(n 
= 
6). 
Similarly 
for 
snoring, 
children 
who 
snored 
never 
or 
occasionally 
(#1-2 
times 
a 
month) 
were 
classified 
as 
non-snorers, 
children 
who 
snored 
often 
or 
always 
($3-5 
times 
per 
week) 
were 
considered 
snorers, 
whereas 
children 
who 
snored 
sometimes 
(1-2 
times 
per 
week) 
were 
excluded 
(n 
= 
8). 
The 
final 
sample 
(n 
= 
64) 
was 
divided 
in 
4 
groups 
(Table 
I) 
and 
had 
a 
mean 
age 
(± 
SD) 
of 
10.4 
± 
3.0 
years 
(range, 
6.2-16.8 
years). 


Apparatus 


An 
abbreviated 
test 
battery 
was 
selected 
to 
minimize 
task 
demands 
on 
children 
while 
still 
testing 
areas 
of 
functioning 
that 
have 
been 
reported 
to 
show 
deficits 
in 
children 
with 
sleep 
disorders.9-11,13,24 
The 
test 
battery 
was 
administered 
by 
a 
trained 
psychologist. 


The 
Wechsler 
Abbreviated 
Scale 
of 
Intelligence 
was 
used 
to 
test 
intelligence 
(IQ), 
with 
4 
subtests 
measuring 
verbal, 
performance, 
and 
global 
IQ. 
These 
measures 
have 
a 
mean 
of 
100 
(SD 
= 
15).25 


The 
Children’s 
Memory 
Scale 
word 
pairs 
and 
numbers 
subtests 
were 
used 
to 
test 
verbal 
and 
nonverbal 
short-and 
long-term 
memory. 
Children 
were 
required 
to 
remember 
lists 
of 
words 
or 
numbers 
and 
repeat 
them 
back 
during 
3 
trials. 
This 
gave 
a 
learning 
score. 
Word 
pairs 
was 
also 
re-tested 
after 
a 
20 
minutes, 
giving 
both 
a 
short-and 
longer-term 
memory 
score. 
Word 
pairs 
learning 
and 
short-term 
recall 
were 
summed 
to 
give 
a 
word 
pairs 
total 
score. 
The 
Children’s 
Memory 
Scale 
numbers 
subtest 
is 
thought 
to 
measure 
short-term 
working 
nonverbal 
memory. 
All 
memory 
subtests 
have 
a 
mean 
of 
10 
(SD 
=

(ACPT) 
and 
the 
Test

Attention 
in 
Children 
(TEA-Ch)

were 
used 
to 
test 
attention. 
The

attention 
and 
impulsivity 
by 
listening 
for 
a

word 
among 
many 
distracter 
words. 
A

Higher 
scores 
on 
all 
3 
ACPT 
subscales 
are 
indicative 
of 
increased 
errors. 
Because 
normative 
data 
in 
the 
ACPT 
is 
limited 
to 
children 
<12 
years 
old, 
raw 
scores 
were 
used 
in 
analyses.27 
Because 
the 
code 
transmission 
subtest 
from 
the 
TEA-Ch 
is 
standardized 
in 
children 
6 
to 
16 
years 
old, 
it 
was 
used 
as 
an 
additional 
measure 
of 
auditory 
sustained 
attention 
in 
which 
children 
were 
to 
identify 
a 
number 
before 
2 
target 
numbers. 
Lower 
TEA-Ch 
scores 
are 
indicative 
of 
reduced 
attention 
capacity. 
TEA-Ch 
subtests 
have 
a 
mean 
of 
10 
(SD 
= 
3).28 


The 
Child 
Behaviour 
Checklist 
(CBCL) 
was 
used 
to 
measure 
competent 
behavior 
and 
also 
internalized, 
externalized, 
and 
other 
behaviors, 
which 
combine 
into 
a 
total 
problem 
behavior 
score. 
Scores 
are 
based 
on 
responses 
to 
20 
competency 
items 
and 
118 
problematic 
items. 
Behavior 
scores 
were 
transformed 
into

During 
the 
testing 
session, 
parents 
completed 
the 
CBCL 
and 
a 
second 
SDSC 
and 
gave 
demographic 
information 
(address, 
schooling 
[private 
or 
state], 
occupation, 
and 
level 
of 
education). 
Although 
efforts 
were 
made 
to 
test 
children 
before 
school 
or 
on 
non-school 
days, 
parental 
availability 
limited 
this 
to 
32 
of 
the 
64 
children. 
All 
children 
except 
4 
were 
tested 
between 
9:00

2:00 
p.m.

The 
study 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
ethics 
committee 
of 
the 
University

parents 
signed

Statistical 
Analyses 


Chi-square 
analyses 
were 
used 
to 
test 
for 
group 
differences 
in 
demographic 
and 
test 
condition 
parameters. 
A 
series 
of 
one-way 
analysis 
of 
variance 
tests 
were 
used 
to 
explore 
the 
effect 
of 
group 
on 
neuropsychological 
and 
psychosocial 
parameters 
and 
Fisher 
Planned 
Least 
Significant 
Difference 
(PLSD) 
post-hoc 
tests 
to 
test 
for 
significance 
and 
main 
effects. 
The 
relationships 
between 
variables 
were 
explored 
with 
the 
Pearson 
r 
correlations 
with 
the 
Fisher 
r-z 
transformations 
to 
test 
for 
significance. 
A 
series 
of 
multiple 
regression 
analyses 
were 
undertaken 
to 
further 
explore 
the 
relative 
contribution 
of 
snoring 
and 
BSP 
to 
the 
variance 
in 
neuropsychological 
and 
psychosocial 
scores. 
Statistical 
significance 
was 
set 
at 
a 
P 
value 
of 
.05. 
Because 
of 
the 
exploratory 
nature 
of 
the 
data, 
no 
corrections 
were 
made 
for 
multiple 
comparisons. 
Data 
were 
analyzed 
with 
a 
commercially 
available 
statistical 
softward 
package 
(Statview 
1992-98, 
SAS 
Institute).

Subject 
Demographics 


Of 
the 
total 
sample 
(n 
= 
64), 
59% 
were

Chi-square 
analyses 
revealed 
no 
significant 
group 
differences 
in 
paternal 
or 
maternal 
education 
or

Between-group 
Differences 


The

(±SD) 
SDSC 
sleep

neuropsychological, 
and 
psychosocial 
scores 
are 
reported 
in 
Table 
II.In 
summary, 
questionnaire 
responses 
for 
sleep 
confirmed 
group 
classification, 
with 
parents 
of 
children 
in 
the 
Snorers 
and 
Snorers1BSP 
groups 
reporting 
higher 
snoring 
scores 
and 
parents 
of 
children 
in 
the 
BSP 
and 
Snorers1BSP 
groups 
reporting 
higher 
BSP 
scores. 
For 
neuropsychological 
function, 
with 
1 
exception, 
children 
in 
the 
Snorers1BSP 
group, 
followed 
by 
children 
in 
the 
Snorers 
group, 
performed 
the 
poorest 
on 
all 
IQ 
and 
attention 
tests, 
compared 
with 
children 
in 
the 
BSP 
and 
Controls 
groups. 
The 
1 
exception 
was 
for 
memory, 
in 
which 
children 
in 
the 
Snorers1BSP 
and 
BSP 
groups 
performed 
worse 
than 
children 
in 
the 
Snorers 
group, 
followed 
by 
the 
Controls 
group, 
although 
these 
differences 
did 
not 
reach 
significance. 
For 
behavior, 
parents 
of 
the 
children 
in 
the 
Snorers1BSP 
and 
BSP 
groups 
reported 
more 
problematic 
behavior 
and 
lower 
competency 
than 
parents 
of 
children 
in 
the 
Snorers 
and 
Controls 
groups, 
who 
reported 
generally 
comparable 
scores. 
Except 
for 
1 
case, 
post 
hoc 
analyses 
of 
specific 
CBCL 
subscales 
confirmed 
that 
for 
all 
subscales 
of 
the 
CBCL, 
parents 
of

Relationships 
between

were 
examined. 
To 
increase 
statistical

were 
examined 
on 
the 
combined 
subject 
groups 
(n

completion 
and 
completion 
of 
the 
SDSC 
at 
time 
of 
testing 
(n

were 
included. 
Overall, 
higher

were 
moderately 
related 
to 
lower 
IQ 
scores, 
poorer 
attentional 
capacity, 
less 
competent 
behavior, 
and 
increased 
problematic

(Table

Higher

were 
moderately 
correlated 
to 
impaired

and 
increased 
problematic 
behavior. 
Overall, 
snoring 
showed 
a 
stronger 
relationship 
with 
IQ 
and 
attention, 
whereas 
BSP 
showed 
a 
stronger 
relationship 
with 
memory 
and 
behavior. 


To 
test 
predictive 
contributions, 
a 
stepwise 
regression 
was 
conducted 
on 
the 
whole 
sample 
(n 
=

using 
parameters 
of

BSP 
as

DISCUSSION 


This 
study 
found 
that 
snoring 
was 
significantly 
associated 
with 
reduced 
IQ 
and 
attentional 
capacity, 
but 
not 
with 
reduced 
memory, 
and 
only 
moderately 
with 
problematic 
behavior. 
In 
contrast 
to 
snoring, 
BSP 
were 
associated 
with 
increased 
problematic 
behavior 
and 
impaired 
nonverbal 
memory, 
but 
less 
with 
reduced 
intelligence 
and 
attention. 
When 
snoring 
and 
BSP 
occur 
in 
combination, 
they 
have 
a 
significantly 
greater 
impact 
on 
daytime 
function 
than 
when 
they 
occur 
separately. 


Previous 
studies 
support 
the 
findings 
that 
snoring 
is 
associated 
with 
reduced 
IQ 
and 
attention 
in 
children 
who 
snore 
and 
who 
have 
SDB.10,11,30 
Although 
this 
evidence 
suggests 
that 
children 
with 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
associated 
with 
hypoxia 
during 
sleep 
are 
more 
likely 
to 
have 
reduced 
IQ 
and 
attentional 
capacity, 
similar 
findings 
have 
also 
been 
reported 
in 
children 
with 
non-hypoxic 
snoring, 
which 
was 
previously 
thought 
to 
be 
innocuous.

al12 
reported 
reduced 
mathematical 
skills 
in 
5 
children 
with 
nonhypoxic 
snoring, 
whereas 
Ali 
et 
al13 
reported 
an 
improvement 
in 
cognitive 
function 
in 
11 
non-hypoxic 
snorers 
after 
amelioration 
of 
snoring. 
Similar 
findings 
have 
been 
reported 
in 
a 
large 
sample 
of 
snorers, 
in 
which 
children 
who 
snored 
but 
did 
not 
have 
hypoxia 
had 
reduced 
academic 
performance 
compared 
with 
that 
of 
control 
subjects 
(n 
= 
851).14 
Although 
this 
study 
did 
not 
assess 
the 
presence 
of 
hypoxia 
and 
we 
cannot 
therefore 
discount 
that 
some 
of 
these 
snorers 
had 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
syndrome 
nor 
that 
respiratory 
arousals 
potentially 
affected 
the 
outcome, 
the 
findings 
nonetheless 
support 
the 
mounting 
evidence 
that 
snoring 
is 
implicated 
in 
specific 
neuropsychological 
deficits 
in 
children. 
In 
this 
study, 
snoring 
was 
not 
related 
to 
reduced 
memory 
capacity. 
This 
is 
contrary 
to 
the 
findings 
of 
2 
groups 
that 
have 
previously 
reported 
both 
reduced 
verbal 
and 
nonverbal 
memory 
(Wide 
Range 
Assessment 
of 
Memory 
and 
Learning) 
in 
children 
with 
objectively 
measured 
SDB.11,24 
However, 
we 
found 
that 
BSP 
were 
significantly 
associated 
with 
and 
predictive 
of 
reduced 
nonverbal 
memory 
performance 
(numbers 
subtest). 
These 
findings 
remain 
unexplained. 
In 
larger 
studies 
in 
adults2,31,33 
and 
children,5,32 
sleep 
disruption, 
sleep 
deprivation, 
or 
both 
have 
been 
linked 
to 
daytime 
dysfunction 
in 
general5,32,33 
and 
memory 
impairment 
in 
particular.2,31 
Further 
studies 
using 
a 
broader 
range 
of 
memory 
tasks 
and 
objective 
measurement 
of 
sleep 
disruption 
in 
a 
larger 
sample 
are 
needed 
to 
assess 
whether 
sleep 
disruption 
is 
a 
primary 
contributor 
to 
memory 
dysfunction 
in 
children, 
as 
is 
suggested 
in 
this 
self-report 
study. 


The 
second 
main 
finding 
from 
this 
study 
was 
that 
children 
with 
BSP 
had 
significantly 
more 
impaired 
psychosocial 
functioning 
than 
all 
other 
groups. 
Although 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
children 
with 
problematic 
behavior 
simply 
have 
poorer 
sleep, 
we 
believe 
it 
is 
likely 
that 
sleep 
disruption 
per 
se 
is 
important 
in 
behavioral 
regulation. 
Other 
potential 
hypotheses 
include 
the 
possibility 
that

strong 
relationship

between 
behavioral 
sleep 
problems 
and 
behavior 
may 
be 
caused 
by 
parental 
generalization 
of 
nighttime 
and 
daytime 
behavioral 
problems 
in 
their 
children, 
particularly 
in 
problematic 
children, 
or 
that 
a 
high 
percentage 
of 
these 
behavioral 
problems 
may 
be 
caused 
by 
parenting 
styles 
that 
reflect 
poor 
behavior 
management 
both 
at 
night 
and 
during 
the 
day. 
However, 
daytime 
behavioral 
problems 
have 
been 
observed 
in 
children 
with 
non-behavioral 
sleep 
disorders 
that 
disrupt 
sleep, 
such 
as 
periodic 
limb 
movement 
disorder34,35 
and 
parasomnias.36 
It 
therefore 
would 
seem 
improbable 
that 
the 
findings 
in 
this 
study 
would 
be 
entirely 
explained 
by 
parental 
generalization 
or 
parenting 
style. 
As 
such, 
this 
study 
suggests 
that 
poor 
sleep 
consolidation, 
disrupted 
sleep, 
or 
both 
are 
associated 
with 
problematic 
daytime 
behavior 
and 
further 
suggests 
that 
despite 
the 
subjective 
nature 
of 
parental 
reporting, 
behavior 
in 
children 
with 
these 
sleep 
problems 
may 
be 
more 
problematic 
than 
in 
children 
who 
snore. 


The 
third 
main 
finding 
in 
this 
study 
was 
that 
a 
combination 
of 
snoring 
and 
BSP 
showed 
a 
greater 
impact 
on 
neuropsychological 
functioning 
than 
BSP 
or 
snoring 
alone. 
In 
this 
study, 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
assess 
whether 
these 
increased 
decrements 
are 
caused 
by 
increased 
severity 
of 
either 
SDB 
or 
BSP 
in 
this 
group 
or 
even 
whether 
daytime 
sleepiness 
may 
have 
played 
a 
mediating 
role 
in 
daytime 
function. 
However, 
the 
findings 
suggest 
that 
cognitive 
and 
behavioral 
dysfunction 
may 
be 
related 
to 
the 
severity 
of 
co-existing 
and 
co-morbid 
sleep 
problems 
in 
a 
dose-dependent 
manner 
and 
points 
to 
the 
need 
for 
children 
who 
snore 
to 
be 
screened 
for 
additional 
sleep 
disorders 
in 
future 
studies. 
Failing 
to 
do 
so 
may 
obstruct 
a 
more 
complicated 
relationship 
between 
sleep 
and 
daytime 
function 
and, 
thereby, 
our 
understanding 
of 


behavior 
in 
children 
who 
snore 
or 
who 
have 
other 
chronic 
sleep 
problems. 
To 
date, 
only 
Owens 
et 
al15 
have 
evaluated 
the 
role 
of 
co-morbid 
behavioral 
sleep 
problems 
on 
behavior 
in 
children 
with 
SDB. 
They 
found 
significantly 
more 
problematic 
behaviors 
in 
children 
with 
SDB 
and 
behavioral 
sleep 
disorders 
similar 
to 
those 
found 
in 
this 
study 
(reluctance 
going 
to 
bed 
and 
difficulty 
with 
sleep 
onset; 
n 
= 
22) 
compared 
with 
children 
with 
SDB 
alone 
(n 
= 
78). 
This 
study 
supports 
these 
findings, 
and 
together 
they 
suggest 
that 
disruption 
of 
sleep 
architecture 
may 
overlap 
between 
SDB 
and 
BSP, 
thus 
becoming 
an 
important 
effect 
modifier 
of 
the 
association 
between 
SDB 
and 
daytime 
function. 


Limitations 
of 
this 
study 
include 
the 
voluntary 
nature 
of 
participation 
and 
a 
potential 
self-selection 
bias 
for 
parents 
wanting 
a 
free 
psychological 
assessment. 
However, 
it 
would 
be 
difficult 
to 
explain 
why 
this 
might 
apply 
more 
to 
children 
who 
snore 
or 
have 
BSP 
than 
to 
control 
subjects. 
Also, 
the 
data 
were 
collected 
through 
self-report, 
with 
no 
objective 
evaluation 
of 
sleep 
disturbance 
or 
hypoxia. 
Subjects 
were 
chosen 
from 
a 
clinical 
population, 
with 
group 
entry 
based 
on 
parental 
responses; 
the 
testing 
psychologist 
was 
aware 
of 
the 
child’s 
group 
status 
at 
testing, 
and 
efforts 
to 
control 
testing 
times 
to 
account 
for 
the 
effect 
of 
circadian 
variations 
on 
performance 
may 
not 
have 
been 
sufficient. 
Another 
issue 
is 
that 
the 
arbitrary 
separation 
of 
sleep 
problems 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
a 
questionnaire 
did 
not 
take 
into 
account 
the 
potential 
co-morbidity 
of 
other 
sleep 
problems. 
A 
final 
limitation 
of 
this 
study 
is 
the 
small 
sample 
size, 
despite 
an 
initial 
pool 
of 
166. 


This 
study 
assessed 
neuropsychological 
function 
in 
children 
with 
non-respiratory 
BSP. 
It 
therefore 
augments 
previous 
studies, 
in 
which 
sleep 
disruption 
from 
non-hypoxic 


Neuropsychological 
And 
Psychosocial 
Function 
In 
Children 
With 
A

Problems 



sleep 
disorders 
resulted 
in 
increased 
behavioral 
prob


lems14,35,36 


and 
allows 
a 
better 
evaluation 
of 
the 
relationship 
among 
snoring, 
sleep 
disruption, 
and 
daytime 
function. 
The 
findings 
suggest 
snoring 
and 
BSP 
are 
associated 
with 
neuropsychological 
and 
psychosocial 
function 
in 
different 
ways. 
It 
is 
unclear 
why 
snoring 
could 
be 
associated 
with 
some 
deficits 
and 
BSP 
with 
others. 
It 
is 
possible 
that 
mechanisms 
specific 
to 
snoring 
and 
not 
present 
in 
BSP, 
such 
as 
hypoxia, 
may 
account 
for 
the 
differences 
observed 
in 
neuropsychological 
deficits 
in 
this 
sample. 
Further 
studies 
with 
objective 
measurements 
are 
needed 
to 
clarify 
this 
issue. 
However, 
if 
disruption 
of 
sleep 
architecture 
is 
associated 
with 
the 
neuropsychological 
and 
psychosocial 
development 
of 
children, 
it 
would 
be 
of 
considerable 
clinical 
importance, 
because 
behaviorally 
based 
sleep 
problems, 
which 
disrupt 
sleep, 
are 
among 
the 
most 
common 
problems 
in 
pre-school 
and 
school-aged 
children37 
and 
have 
considerable 
secondary 
effects 
on 
families 
and 
the 
community.
38 
This 
is 
particularly 
significant 
because 
of 
the 
results 
of 
a 
recent 
study 
in 
which 
80% 
of 
significant 
sleep 
problems 
in 
children 
were 
left 
undetected 
and 
untreated 
by 
primary 
health 
care 
practitioners.39
