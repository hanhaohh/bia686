Abstract 

Objective: Based on a few reports that describe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients as having an increased risk of 
acute upper airway obstruction (UAO) after pharmacological sedation, this population is less likely to receive sedation 
prior to surgery. Our objective was to evaluate pediatric patients with sleep-disordered breathing who received 
preoperative sedation to determine if there was an increase in preoperative airway obstruction. Design: Retrospective 
chart review from 1995 to 2000. Setting: Two tertiary care academic medical centers. Patients: Sixty-five children 
(mean age4.79/2.3 years; 49 boys, 16 girls) diagnosed with sleep-disordered breathing by sleep study or clinical 
evaluation that received preoperative midazolam hydrochloride. Outcome measure: The occurrence of preoperative 
adverse events defined as UAO, hypoventilation, desaturation, bradycardia, or sustained lethargy that required active 
intervention after the administration of midazolam hydrochloride within 24 h of surgery. Results: None of the 65 
children evaluated in this study experienced respiratory compromise requiring intervention after the administration of 
preoperative sedation. Potential risk factors such as patients’ age, sex, weight, comorbidities, midazolam hydrochloride 
dose, and severity of sleep apnea did not appear to affect outcome. Conclusion: The preliminary data suggested that 
preoperative sedation might be safely administered to children with mild or moderate sleep-disordered breathing, and

1. Introduction 
Annually, thousands of children undergo various 
surgeries throughout the country. Part of this 
process may require these children to be separated 
from their parents during transport to the operating 
room, which may be quite traumatic for young 
children. To help alleviate the separation anxiety 
experienced by some children, many institutions 
allow parents to accompany their children to the 
operating room up until the point of induction. 
Despite these measures, anxious children still may 
benefit from preoperative sedation with pharmacological 
agents such as the benzodiazepines, 
midazolam hydrochloride syrup (Versed†). Based 
on a few reports that describe obstructive sleep 
apnea (OSA) patients as having an increased risk 
of acute upper airway obstruction (UAO) after 
pharmacological sedation, this population is less 
likely to receive sedation prior to surgery. Sleep-
disordered breathing in children is viewed as a 
continuum of severity from partial obstruction of 
the upper airway producing snoring to increased 
upper airway resistance to continuous episodes of 
complete UAO or obstructive apnea. In the 
pediatric age group, OSA is estimated to havea 
prevalence of 13% [1]. Our objective was to 
evaluate pediatric patients with sleep-disordered 
breathing who underwent tonsillectomy and/or 
adenoidectomy by the Departments of Otolaryngology 
at The State University of New York 
Health Science Center Brooklyn, New York 
(Downstate) and the New York University Medical 
Center, New York (NYU) who received 
preoperative sedation with midazolam hydrochlo


ride to determine if there was an increase in 
preoperative airway obstruction. 

2. Materials and methods 
A retrospective chart review of all children 
(age518) who underwent tonsillectomy and/or 
adenoidectomy for the treatment of OSA between 
1995 and 2001 and received preoperative sedation 
was conducted at the two tertiary care medical 
centers (Downstate and NYU) and their affiliate 
hospitals. Sixty-four children were identified: 41 
from Downstate and its affiliate hospitals (eight 
from Downstate, 32 from the Long Island College 
Hospital, and one from the Kings County Hospital 
Center) and 23 from the Bellevue Hospital 
Center, an affiliate of NYU. Children were 
diagnosed with sleep-disordered breathing based 
on reported symptoms of nighttime snoring, 
apneic pauses, loud gasping respirations, restlessness, 
paradoxical chest movements, retractions 
enuresis, profuse diaphoresis, and daytime somnolence 
and physical examination documenting adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy or by overnight or nap 
polysomnography. 

The anesthesia records and surgical progress 
notes were reviewed in order to identify adverse 
events requiring intervention after the administration 
of midazolam hydrochloride, either prior to 
the administration of general anesthesia, intraoperative, 
or postoperative until discharge. Adverse 
events were defined as UAO, hypoventilation, 
desaturation, bradycardia, or sustained lethargy. 
In the holding area and during transport to the 
operating room where pulse oximetry and electro

cardiographic monitoring were not performed, 
adverse events were only defined as witnessed 
UAO, hypoventilation, or sustained lethargy. 
Continuous pulse oximetry was maintained postoperatively 
until discharge, but electrocardiographic 
monitoring was only continued after 
discharge from the recovery room in children 
admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit for 
observation. Additional data examined as potential 
risk factors were patient’s age, sex, weight, 
comorbid conditions including craniofacial 
anomalies and syndromes, and severity of sleep 
apnea. Children whose weights were greater than 
the 95th percentile for age were considered obese, 
and children whose weights were less than the 5th 
percentile for age were considered underweight. 

3. Results 
A total of 65 children, 49 males and 16 females 
mean age 4.7 (9/2.3) years participated in this 
study. The ethnicities were as follows: 36 Caucasian, 
15 African American, 12 Hispanic, and two 
East Asian. Nineteen percent were obese and 4% 
were underweight. Twelve children had pre-existing 
comorbid conditions such as asthma (5), 
anemia (2), cerebral palsy (2), Apert Syndrome 
(1), icthyosis (1), and Bell’s palsy (1). Fifty-four 
(89%) children were diagnosed with sleep-disordered 
breathing by clinical evaluation, two (3%) 
had sleep tapes demonstrating pauses greater than 
5 s, and the remaining nine (14%) had polysomnography 
positive for OSA with respiratory disturbance 
indexes (RDIs) ranging from mild to severe, 
mean RDI of 14.49/11.7, range 2.840.7. Adenotonsillectomies 
were performed in 63 children with 
one tonsillectomy and one adenoidectomy performed 
in the remaining two children. 

None of the 65 children evaluated in this study 
experienced preoperative airway obstruction, hypoventilation, 
desaturation, bradycardia, or sustained 
lethargy after the administration of 
preoperative sedation. All the children were admitted 
for 23 h observation with pulse oximetry, 
which is the routine practice of our pediatric 
otolaryngologists for children diagnosed with 
OSA. The mean dose of midazolam hydrochloride 

given in this study was 8.0 mg (9/2.7), with the 
average dosing of 0.4 mg/kg (9/0.1), which was 
consistent with the manufacturer’s recommended 
dose of 0.251.0 mg/kg up to a maximum of 20 mg 
total. 

4. Discussion 
Because OSA patients have been reported to 
have airway obstruction and ventillatory arrest 
after minimal doses of sedation, many anesthesiologists 
will not prescribe sedation preoperatively. A 
review of the literature failed to demonstrate an 
established protocol regarding the administration 
of midazolam hydrochloride to pediatric OSA 
patients preoperatively. Studies have shown that 
the use of sedative medications such as benzodiazepines 
or opioids may precipitate apnea by 
reducing pharyngeal muscle tone or decreasing 
respiratory drive particularly when given concomitantly 
[2]. Other studies have shown benzodiazepines 
to cause a selective decrease in hypoglossal 
nerve and genioglossus activity, which may lead to 
a loss of upper airway patency resulting in 
obstruction [3,4]. According to the manufacturer, 
the occurrence of respiratory depression, oxygen 
desaturation, apnea, and airway obstruction occurs 
in less than 1% of pediatric patients following 
premedication with midazolam hydrochloride 
syrup. To date, there have been no conclusive 
studies demonstrating that midazolam hydrochloride 
alone increases the rate of apnea and UAO in 
pediatric OSA patients as compared with the rest 
of the population. 

Bailey et al. [5] conducted a study administering 
midazolam hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg intravenously) 
with and without opioids (fentanyl 2 mg/ 
kg IV) in healthy adult males. They concluded that 
midazolam alone did not produce any significant 
respiratory effects such as hypoxemia, apnea, or 
obstruction. However, fentanyl alone produced 
dose-dependent respiratory depression that was 
further exacerbated when given concomitantly 
with midazolam. This increase in respiratory 
depression seen when used in conjunction with 
opioids is consistent with the manufacturer’s 
warnings on the package insert.

Because this was a retrospective multi-institutional 
study, there was no set protocol for 
midazolam hydrochloride administration. The 
mean dose of midazolam hydrochloride used in 
this study was 0.4 mg/kg, which followed the 
guidelines recommended by the manufacturer, 
from 0.25 to 1.0 mg/kg with an absolute maximum 
dose of 20 mg. After the administration of sedation, 
the children were observed by the anesthesia 
and nursing staff in the holding area and during 
transport to the operating room for signs of 
airway obstruction, hypoventilation, and lethargy 
without the use of pulse oximetry. Postoperatively 
patients had additional monitoring with pulse 
oximetry in the recovery room and on the floor 
or the intensive care unit. None of the patients in 
this study experienced adverse respiratory events 
after premedication with midazolam. These results 
suggest that pediatric patients with sleep-disordered 
breathing do not have an increase in UAO 
as compared with the rest of the population when 
midazolam hydrochloride is given at the recommended 
dose. Other data examined as potential 
risk factors such as age, weight, race, sex, coexisting 
medical problems, severity of OSA, and dosing 
schedule appeared not to have any effect on the 
final outcome. 

Our study was limited because the majority of 
patients were diagnosed clinically without sleep 
studies making the severity of their sleep-disordered 
breathing difficult to categorize. Therefore, 
we were not able to accurately assess whether the 
degree of OSA would have any effect on the rate of 
UAO after premedication. In addition, only one of 

the children evaluated in this study had a craniofacial 
anomaly making it difficult to assess 
whether this subset of OSA patients has a higher 
incidence of airway obstruction after premedication. 


5. Conclusion 
The preliminary data suggested that preoperative 
sedation might be safely administered to 
children with mild or moderate sleep-disordered 
breathing, and possibly to children with severe 
sleep apnea, if children are closely observed for 
signs of airway obstruction, hypoventilation, and 
lethargy by the nursing and anesthesia staff prior 
to surgery. Further prospective studies are needed 
to confirm these results.
