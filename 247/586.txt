ABSTRACT. 
Objective. 
To 
assess 
whether 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
(SDB), 
ranging 
from 
primary 
snoring 
to 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
(OSA), 
is 
associated 
with 
increased 
behavioral 
morbidity. 


Methods. 
A 
cross-sectional 
study 
was 
conducted 
of 
school-aged 
children 
in 
an 
urban, 
community-based 
cohort, 
stratified 
for 
term 
or 
preterm 
(<37 
weeks’ 
gestation) 
birth 
status. 
A 
total 
of 
829 
children, 
8 
to 
11 
years 
old 
(50% 
female, 
46% 
black, 
46% 
former 
preterm 
birth) 
were 
recruited 
from 
a 
cohort 
study. 
All 
children 
had 
unattended 
in-home 
overnight 
cardiorespiratory 
recordings 
of 
airflow, 
respiratory 
effort, 
oximetry, 
and 
heart 
rate 
for 
measurement 
of 
the 
apnea 
hypopnea 
index 
(number 
of 
obstructive 
apneas 
and 
hypopneas 
per 
hour). 
SDB 
was 
defined 
by 
either 
parent-reported 
habitual 
snoring 
or 
objectively 
measured 
OSA. 
Functional 
outcomes 
were 
assessed 
with 
2 
well-validated 
parent 
ratings 
of 
behavior 
problems: 
the 
Child 
Behavioral 
Checklist 
and 
the 
Conners 
Parent 
Rating 
Scale–Revised:Long. 


Results. 
Forty 
(5%) 
children 
were 
classified 
as 
having 
OSA 
(median 
apnea 
hypopnea 
index: 
7.1 
per 
hour; 
interquartile 
range: 
3.1–10.5), 
122 
(15%) 
had 
primary 
snoring 
without 
OSA, 
and 
the 
remaining 
667 
(80%) 
had 
neither 
snoring 
nor 
OSA. 
Children 
with 
SDB 
had 
significantly 
higher 
odds 
of 
elevated 
problem 
scores 
in 
the 
following 
domains: 
externalizing, 
hyperactive, 
emotional 
lability, 
oppositional, 
aggressive, 
internalizing, 
somatic 
complaints, 
and 
social 
problems. 


Conclusions. 
Children 
with 
relatively 
mild 
SDB, 
ranging 
from 
primary 
snoring 
to 
OSA, 
have 
a 
higher 
prevalence 
of 
problem 
behaviors, 
with 
the 
strongest, 
most 
consistent 
associations 
for 
externalizing, 
hyperactive-
type 
behaviors.

here 
is 
increasing 
evidence 
that 
childhood 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
(SDB) 
is 
associated 
with 
behavioral 
problems, 
including 
hyperactivity, 
inattention, 
and 
aggression.1–15 
Improvements 
in 
behavior 
and 
learning 
after 
treatment 
for 
SDB 
suggest 
that 
these 
deficits 
may 
be 
partially 


reversible.2,4,6,9,16–18 


Unfortunately, 
many 
of 
the 
previous 
studies 
supporting 
this 
relationship 
are 
subject 
to 
methodologic 
criticisms, 
including 
(1) 
failure 
to 
account 
for 
the 
children’s 
background 
characteristics; 
(2) 
recruitment 
from 
clinical 
populations 
that 
may 
oversample 
children 
with 
behavioral 
problems1,2,4,8–10,13,16,18,19; 
(3) 
lack 
of 
objective 
measures 
of 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
(OSA) 
in 
all 
pa


tients3,5–7,10–12,14,16,20; 
and 
(4) 


use 
of 
nonvalidated 
measures 
of 
behavior 
outcomes.2,4,6,16,20 
In 
view 
of 
these 
limitations, 
past 
associations 
of 
SDB 
and 
behavior 
problems 
are 
of 
uncertain 
significance. 


In 
this 
analysis, 
a 
unique 
community-based 
cohort 
of 
school-aged 
children 
was 
studied 
to 
assess 
the 
behavioral 
outcomes 
of 
SDB 
using 
both 
objective 
measures 
of 
OSA 
and 
parent 
reports 
of 
snoring. 
Our 
primary 
interest 
was 
to 
assess 
the 
association 
of 
SDB 
and 
increased 
behavioral 
morbidities, 
controlling 
for 
confounding. 
We 
hypothesized 
that 
SDB 
in 
children 
would 
be 
associated 
with 
increased 
behavioral 
morbidities, 
specifically 
in 
the 
domains 
of 
inattention, 
hyperactivity, 
and 
other 
externalizing 
(“acting 
out”) 
type 
behaviors. 
Some 
of 
the 
behavioral 
data 
in 
this 
study 
have 
been 
previously 
published

METHODS 


Study 
Sample 


The 
Cleveland 
Children’s 
Sleep 
and 
Health 
Study 
is 
a 
nonclinical, 
unreferred, 
urban, 
community-based 
cohort 
of 
907 
children 
who 
were 
studied 
at 
8 
to 
11 
years 
of 
age. 
This 
cohort 
was 
originally 
assembled 
as 
a 
stratified 
random 
sample 
of 
term 
and 
pre-
term 
(37 
weeks’ 
gestational 
age) 
children 
who 
were 
born 
between 
1988 
and 
1993. 
This 
unique 
cohort 
was 
specifically 
assembled 
to 
overrepresent 
black 
and 
former 
preterm 
children 
to 
have 
internally 
valid 
and 
stable 
estimates 
of 
the 
relationship 
of 
these 
factors 
to 
SDB 
and 
other 
health 
outcomes. 
Methods 
for 
cohort 
assembly 
and 
recruitment 
have 
been 
previously 
reported.21 
A 
total 
of 
73 
children 
were 
excluded 
from 
analysis 
because 
of 
incomplete 
data: 
48 
with 
technical 
failures 
of 
their 
home 
overnight 
cardiorespiratory 
study 
(behavioral 
scales 
and 
snoring 
data 
complete), 
9 
with 
missing 
parent-reported 
behavior 
scales 
and 
snoring 
data 
(all 
non-OSA 
children 
based 
on 
respiratory 
data), 
8 
with 
missing 
parent-reported 
behavioral 
scales 
(complete 
respiratory 
and 
snoring 
data), 
3 
with 
missing 
snoring 
data 
(non-OSA 
based 
on 
respiratory 
data, 
behavioral 
data 
were 
complete), 
and 
5 
with 
missing 
data 
for 
all 
3 
assessments 
(behavior 
scales, 
snoring, 
and 
respiratory). 
An 
additional 
5 
children 
were 
excluded,

for 
an

difference 
of 
2 
months 
considered 
to 
be 
clinically 
insignificant. 
Institutional 
Review 
Boards 
at 
participating 
hospitals 
approved 
the 
protocol. 
The 
child’s 
legal 
guardian 
provided 
informed 
consent, 
and 
the 
child 
gave 
assent. 


Measures 


Demographic 
and 
medical 
data 
were 
assessed 
with 
the 
Child 
Sleep 
Questionnaire, 
a 
pediatric 
modification 
of 
a 
validated 
questionnaire.
22 
For 
analytic 
purposes, 
race/ethnicity 
was 
dichotomized 
as 
black 
or 
nonblack 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
previous 
studies 
showing 
that 
black 
race/ethnicity 
was 
a 
risk 
factor 
for 
SDB.21,23,24 
Asthma 
was 
defined 
as 
a 
parent 
report 
of 
doctor-diagnosed 
asthma 
plus 
either 
wheezing 
symptoms 
or 
asthma 
medication 
use. 
Parents 
completed 
2 
well-validated

In 
brief, 
limited-channel

included

heart 
rate, 
and

(PT-2

OSA 
was 
defined 
as 
an 
obstructive 
apnea 
hypopnea 
index 
of 
5 
events 
per 
hour 
and/or 
an 
obstructive 
apnea 
index 
1 
events 
per 
hour.21,28 
Children 
without 
OSA 
were 
categorized 
as 
having 
primary 
snoring 
when 
the 
caregiver 
answered 
“yes” 
to 
the 
statement 
“loud 
snoring 
in 
the 
past 
month” 
at 
least 
1 
to 
2 
times 
per 
week. 
Children 
with 
either 
OSA 
or 
primary 
snoring 
were 
categorized 
as 
having 
SDB, 
whereas 
children 
who 
neither 
snored 
nor 
had 
OSA 
were 
categorized 
as 
no-SDB. 


Behavioral 
Assessments 


The 
CPRS-R:L 
is 
a 
well-validated, 
80-item 
measure 
of 
childhood 
behavior 
problems.26 
This 
instrument 
yields 
7 
behavioral 
subscales—oppositional, 
cognitive/inattention, 
hyperactivity, 
anxious-shy, 
perfectionism, 
social, 
and 
psychosomatic—as 
well 
as 
4 
composite 
indices. 
The 
CBCL 
is 
a 
widely 
used 
118-item 
instrument 
that 
assesses 
multiple 
dimensions 
of 
psychopathology,

(activities,

For 
each 
instrument, 
raw

scores 
were 
converted 
to 
age-and 
gender-
adjusted 
t 
scores 
(mean:

SD:

on 
the 
basis 
of

norms 
constructed 
from 
population-based 
samples. 
Scale 
scores 
were 
dichotomized 
such 
that 
t 
scores 
in 
the 
borderline 
clinical 
or 
clinically 
abnormal 
range 
were 
defined 
as

Statistical 
Analysis 


Analyses 
were 
done 
using 
SAS 
v8.2 
(SAS 
Institute, 
Inc, 
Cary, 
NC). 
Group 
differences 
were 
compared 
with 
2-sample 
t 
tests 
and 
Pearson 
2 
tests 
for 
continuous 
and 
categorical 
data, 
respectively. 
Logistic 
regression 
was 
used 
to 
assess 
the 
relationship 
between 
SDB 
and 
each 
outcome 
while 
controlling 
for 
key 
covariates: 
age, 
gender, 
race/ethnicity, 
preterm 
status, 
and 
caregiver 
education. 
Models 
were 
constructed 
with 
and 
without 
the 
covariates 
body 
mass 
index 
(BMI) 
and 
asthma 
as 
exploratory 
assessments 
for 
potential 
confounding. 
Interactions 
between 
SDB 
and 
race 
and 
SDB 
and 
preterm 
status 
were 
evaluated. 
Associations 
between 
SDB 
and 
the 
outcomes 
are 
expressed 
as 
odds 
ratios 
(ORs) 
with 
corresponding 
95% 
confidence 
intervals 
(CIs). 
All 
reported 
P 
values 
are 
2-tailed 
with 
statistical 
significance 
set 
at 
.05. 
Sensitivity 
analyses 
were 
conducted 
to 
explore 
differences 
between 
the 
adjusted 
ORs 
for 
the 
behavioral 
outcomes 
for 
children 
with 
OSA 
compared 
with 
children 
with 
primary 
snoring 
and 
potentially 
to 
justify 
combining 
these 
2 
groups 
into 
a 
single 
SDB 
exposure 
variable. 
When 
SDB 
was 
significantly 
associated 
with 
a 
specific 
behavioral 
outcome, 
sensitivity 
analyses 
were 
also 
conducted 
via 
stratified 
analyses 
to 
explore 
the 
stability 
of 
the 
relationship 
within 
key 
subgroups 
(black/nonblack; 
term/preterm; 
male/female) 
while 
controlling 
for 
any 
other 
confounders 
identified 
in 
the 
primary 
analyses.

interquartile 
range: 
3.1– 
10.5), 
55% 
of 
whom 
had 
parent-reported 
snoring; 
122 
(15%) 
children 
with 
only 
primary 
snoring 
and 
no 
OSA; 
and 
667 
(80%) 
children 
with 
neither 
snoring 
nor 
OSA. 
On 
the 
basis 
of 
parent 
report, 
the 
mean 
total 
hours 
of 
sleep 
per 
night 
were 
9.2 
(SD: 
1.1) 
hours 
on 
week 
nights 
and 
9.2 
(SD: 
1.3) 
hours 
on 
weekend 
nights, 
with 
no 
differences 
among 
the 
groups. 
Fourteen 
percent 
of 
the 
sample 
had 
doctor-diagnosed 
asthma. 


Because 
snoring 
and 
OSA 
represent 
a 
spectrum 
of 
childhood 
SDB, 
preliminary 
analyses 
first 
compared 
children 
who 
had 
OSA 
with 
children 
who 
had 
primary 
snoring. 
Because 
these 
2 
groups 
had 
generally 
comparable 
distributions 
of 
behavioral 
outcomes, 
they 
were 
combined 
into 
a 
single 
SDB 
exposure 
group 
and 
compared 
with 
children 
without 
SDB 
for 
subsequent 
analyses. 


Relationship 
of 
Covariates 
to 
Behavioral 
Outcomes 


Many 
behavioral 
outcomes 
were 
significantly 
associated 
with 
race/ethnicity, 
preterm 
status, 
and 
caregiver 
education. 
Among 
the 
behavioral 
scales 
in 
which 
SDB 
was 
a 
significant 
predictor 
of 
adverse 
behavioral 
outcomes, 
caregiver 
education 
was 
a 
significant 
predictor 
for 
every 
outcome 
except 
the 
CBCL 
somatic 
complaints. 
Black 
race/ethnicity 
was 
a 
significant 
predictor 
only 
for 
the 
CBCL 
Total 
Problem 
scale, 
whereas 
preterm 
birth 
was 
significantly 
related 
to 
CBCL 
Total 
Problem, 
CBCL 
Social 
Problems, 
and 
CPRS-R:L 
Hyperactivity 
scales. 
In 
these 
models, 
the 
former 
covariates, 
when 
significant, 
identified 
children 
with 
higher 
odds 
of 
behavior 
problems 
when 
respectively 
compared 
with 
unexposed 
children. 
All 
logistic 
models 
were 
adjusted 
for 
the 
same 
covariates 
(black 
race/ethnicity, 
preterm 
status, 
and 
caregiver 
education) 
to 
improve 
the 
comparability 
of 
the 
models 
presented 
below. 


Relationship 
of 
SDB 
to 
Behavioral 
Outcomes 


Children 
with 
SDB 
had 
twice 
the 
odds 
of 
having 
CBCL 
total 
problem 
scores 
in 
the 
borderline 
or 
clinical 
range 
compared 
with 
children 
without 
SDB, 
and 
these 
differences 
persisted 
after 
covariate 
adjustment 
(adjusted 
OR: 
2.2; 
95% 
CI: 
1.4–3.4; 
P 
. 
.001). 
Because 
the 
CBCL 
and 
CPRS-R:L 
identify 
many 
similar 
behavioral 
constructs, 
the 
remaining 
behavioral 
outcomes 
were 
grouped 
into 
2 
broad 
problem 
categories: 
externalizing, 
internalizing, 
and 
social 
problems 
and 
competencies. 
The 
unadjusted 
and 
adjusted 
relationships 
between 
SDB 
and 
these 
behavioral 
outcome 
groups 
are 
summarized 
in 
Tables 
2, 
3, 
and 
4, 
respectively. 
Compared 
with 
children 
without 
SDB, 
children 
with 
SDB 
had 
2.6 
times 
the 
odds 
of 
having 
a 
borderline 
or 
clinically 
abnormal 
score 
for 
the 
CBCL 
externalizing 
scale 
(95% 
CI: 
1.6 
–4.3; 
P 
. 
.001). 
Analyses 
of 
individual 
scales 
indicated 
that 
compared 
with 
children 
without 
SDB, 
children 
with 
SDB 
had 
significantly 
higher 
odds 
of 
the 
following 
acting-
out 
behavior 
problems: 
hyperactivity 
(1.8; 
95% 
CI: 
1.2–2.8; 
P 
. 
.010), 
emotional 
lability 
(2.9; 
95% 
CI: 
1.7–4.8; 
P 
. 
.001), 
oppositional 
(2.3; 
95% 
CI: 
1.4–3.9; 
P 
. 
.010), 
aggressive 
(4.9; 
95% 
CI: 
2.4–9.9; 
P 
. 
.001), 
and 
another 
index 
of 
hyperactivity, 
the 
CPRS-R:L 
Global 
Total 
Index 
(1.9; 
95% 
CI: 
1.1–3.1; 
P 
. 
.015). 
Although 
unadjusted 
analyses 
for 
attentional 
scales 
(CBCL 
attention, 
CPRS-R:L 
cognitive/inattention, 
and 
CPRS-R:L 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder) 
showed 
a 
significant 
association 
with 
SDB, 
these 
relationships 
were 
not 
statistically 
significant 
after 
controlling 
for 
confounders. 
SDB 
was 
not 
significantly 
associated 
with 
thought 
problems 
in 
either 
unadjusted 
or 
adjusted 
analyses. 


Children 
with 
SDB 
had 
approximately 
twice

odds 
of

DISCUSSION 


This 
study 
assessed 
the 
relationship 
between 
childhood 
SDB 
and 
behavioral 
outcomes 
in 
a 
large 
urban 
community 
sample 
of 
US 
children 
with 
substantial 
black 
representation. 
A 
rigorous 
method 
included 
assessment 
of 
all 
participants 
with 
objective 
overnight 
measurements 
of 
SDB 
and 
2 
well-validated 
behavioral 
measures 
that 
provided 
convergent 
tests 
for 
the 
validity 
of 
the 
observed 
associations. 
This 
work 
confirms 
previous 
studies 
showing 
an 
association 
between 
SDB 
and 
behavioral 
problems 
reported 
in 
clinical 
samples1,2,4,8–10,13,16,18,19 
and 
extends 
these 
findings 
by 
specifying 
the 
behavioral 
constructs 
most 
consistently 
associated 
with 
SDB. 
Children 
with 
SDB, 
defined 
as 
primary 
snoring 
and/or 
an 
elevated 
number 
of 
apneas 
and 
hypopneas, 
had 
higher 
odds 
of 
behavior 
problems 
including 
externalizing 
and 
internalizing 
behaviors, 
somatic 
and 
psychosomatic 
complaints, 
and 
social 
(“unpopular”) 
problems. 
Externalizing 
acting-out 
behaviors 
(including 
hyperactive, 
emotional 
labile, 
oppositional, 
and 
aggressive) 
seemed 
to 
be 
the 
most 
robust 
correlates 
of 
SDB. 
The 
results 
also 
revealed 
similar 
increased 
behavioral 
morbidity 
for 
children 
with 
primary 
snoring 
compared 
with 
children 
who 
have 
OSA. 


Suggested 
mechanisms 
linking 
nocturnal 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
and 
SDB 
to 
daytime 
cognitive 
and 
behavioral 
deficits 
include 
sleep 
disruption 
and 
blood 
gas 
abnormalities 
that 
prevent 
sleep-related 
restorative 
processes. 
Sleep 
disruption 
associated 


with 
SDB 
may 
cause 
fatigue 
and 
a 
general 
“irritability” 
that 
may 
impair 
regulation 
of 
impulsivity 
and 
control 
of 
emotions, 
all 
of 
which 
could 
facilitate 
hyperactivity 
and 
other 
externalizing 
acting-out 
behaviors.
31 
In 
addition, 
intermittent 
airflow 
obstruction 
causing 
sleep 
disruption 
and 
intermittent 
hypoxemia, 
especially 
when 
occurring 
at 
key 
developmental 
periods, 
may 
produce 
central 
nervous 
system 
cellular 
injury 
that 
leads 
to 
cortical 
dysfunction 
in 
prefrontal 
regions32 
and 
manifests 
as 
behavioral 
dysregulation 
that 
may 
have 
a 
broad 
negative 
impact 
on 
learning 
and 
academic 
performance. 
Cognitive 
and 
executive 
deficits 
may 
also 
be 
present 
but 
were 
not 
examined 
in 
this 
study. 


On 
the 
basis 
of 
previous 
studies,5,7,10,14,19,20 
we 
had 
hypothesized 
that 
inattention 
also 
would 
be 
strongly 
associated 
with 
SDB. 
Although 
unadjusted 
analyses 
showed 
greater 
odds 
of 
attentional 
problems 
in 
children 
with 
SDB 
compared 
with 
children 
without 
SDB, 
these 
differences 
were 
not 
significant 
after 
controlling 
for 
confounders. 
The 
significant 
association 
reported 
in 
previous 
studies 
could 
relate 
to 
use 
of 
different 
constructs 
of 
“inattention,” 
which 
may 
have 
combined 
inattentive 
and 
hyperactive 
behaviors.
7,14,33 
Biases 
introduced 
by 
oversampling 
referral 
children 
with 
both 
inattention 
and 
SDB10,18,19 
or 
by 
failing 
to 
account 
for 
confounding 
factors 
such 
as 
prematurity 
may 
also 
be 
partially 
responsible 
for 
the 
significant 
association 
with 
inattention 
observed 
in 
past 
studies. 
Overall, 
the 
CBCL 
identified 
more 
behavior 
problems 
in 
the 
SDB 
group 
than 
in 
the 
CPRS


R:L. 
The 
increased 
detection 
of 
problems 
by 
the 
CBCL 
may 
be 
related, 
in 
part, 
to 
the 
greater 
number 
of 
items 
in 
the 
CBCL. 
One 
of 
the 
remarkable 
findings 
in 
this 
study 
was 
the 
comparable 
increased 
behavioral 
morbidity 
in 
children 
with 
primary 
snoring 
and 
children 
with 
OSA, 
suggesting 
that 
snoring 
alone 
may 
be 
associated 
with 
adverse 
behavioral 
outcomes. 
It 
is 
possible 
that 
we 
may 
have 
observed 
a 
larger 
impact 
of 
OSA 
on 
behavioral 
outcomes 
if 
the 
sample 
had 
included 
a 
larger 
number 
of 
more 
severely 
affected 
children. 
Nonetheless, 
our 
data 
support 
an 
association 
between 
primary 
snoring 
and 
behavior 
problems 
that 
does 
not 
seem 
to 
be 
attributable 
to 
unrecognized 
moderate 
to 
severe 
levels 
of 
OSA 
because 
the 
objective 
respiratory 
measurements 
likely 
precluded 
misclassification 
of 
OSA 
at 
this 
level. 
These 
findings 
are 
consistent 
with 
mounting 
evidence 
from 
other 
studies 
that 
suggest 
an 
increased 
risk 
of 
school 
and 
learning 
problems 
in 
children 
with 
primary 
snoring 
or 
relatively 
low 
levels 
of 
obstructive 
breathing 


events.17,20,34–36 


The 
mechanism 
by 
which 
primary 
snoring 
alone 
without 
significant 
OSA 
might 
have 
an 
impact 
on 
daytime 
behavior 
is 
less 
clear 
but 
may 
be 
mediated 
by 
more 
subtle 
physiologic 
disturbances 
whereby 
chronicity 
and 
individual 
vulnerability 
may 
be 
important 
determinants 
of 
impact. 
Middle 
school–aged 
children 
who 
currently 
have 
primary 
snoring 
may 
have 
had 
more 
severe 
SDB, 
possibly 
OSA, 
when 
younger. 
If 
so, 
then 
exposure 
to 
more 
severe 
airflow 
obstruction 
and 
intermittent 
hypoxemia 
during 
critical 
periods 
during 
early 
brain 
development

have 
led 
to 
persistent 
behavioral 
changes 
later 
in 
childhood. 
This 
hypothesis 
is 
supported 
by 
a 
retrospective 
study 
that 
showed 
that 
children 
with 
lower 
academic 
performance 
in 
middle 
school 
were 
significantly 
more 
likely 
to 
have 
snored 
during 
early 
childhood 
and 
to 
have 
undergone 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
snoring 
compared 
with 
better 
performing 
schoolmates.
34 
This 
mechanism 
is 
also 
consistent 
with 
the 
experimental 
rodent 
models 
showing 
that 
early 
exposure 
to 
chronic 
episodic 
hypoxia 
results 
in 
both 
cellular 
changes 
within 
neural 
regions 
associated 
with 
cognitive 
functions 
and 
impaired 
performance 
during 
acquisition 
of 
a 
cognitive 
spatial 
task.37 
Nonetheless, 
our 
finding 
suggests 
that 
children 
who 
snore 
may 
manifest 
excessive 
behavioral 
problems 
and 
possibly 
that 
primary 
snoring 
may 
not 
be 
as 
“benign” 
a 
marker 
as 
previously 
thought.38–40 


Several 
limitations 
of 
this 
study 
must 
be 
considered. 
First, 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
the 
associations 
between 
SDB 
and 
poorer 
behavioral 
outcomes 
may 
be 
driven 
by 
population 
subgroups. 
For 
example, 
poorer 
behavioral 
outcomes 
among 
children 
with 
SDB 
may 
be 
driven 
by 
preterm 
birth 
status 
because 
the 
original 
cohort 
was 
constructed 
by 
overrecruiting 
former 
pre-
term 
infants, 
a 
group 
also 
known 
to 
be 
at 
increased 
risk 
for 
behavioral 
problems.41,42 
Although 
the 
logistic 
regression 
analyses 
were 
adjusted 
for 
former 
pre-
term 
birth 
status, 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
this 
adjustment 
did 
not 
completely 
eliminate 
other 
unmeasured 
explanatory 
variables. 
To 
address 
this 
issue, 
we 
conducted 
separate 
sensitivity 
analyses 
excluding 
the 
premature 
children 
and 
found 
qualitatively 
similar 
ORs 
for 
the 
term 
and 
preterm 
subgroups 
for 
all 
outcomes 
in 
which 
SDB 
was 
a 
significant 
predictor 
except 
for 
the 
CBCL 
somatic 
complaints. 
Specifically 
for 
this 
scale, 
data 
on 
physical 
symptoms 
(eg, 
headache, 
dizzy, 
nausea, 
stomach 
pain) 
included 
in 
the 
somatic 
complaints 
subscale 
are 
known 
to 
be 
more 
ambiguous 
or 
unstable 
when 
children 
who 
are 
more 
vulnerable 
to 
compromised 
health 
status 
(such 
as 
former 
preterm 
infants) 
are 
included 
in 
the 
sample.43 
ORs 
for 
the 
relationship 
between 
SDB 
behavioral 
scale 
scores 
in 
the 
borderline 
or 
clinical 
range 
were 
similar 
for 
both 
genders. 
Finally, 
we 
were 
concerned 
that 
BMI, 
obesity, 
or 
asthma 
may 
have 
confounded 
the 
relationship 
between 
SDB 
and 
behavioral 
outcomes, 
but 
secondary 
analyses 
showed 
that 
this 
was 
not 
the 
case. 


Because 
race 
is 
associated 
with 
SDB 
and 
may 
be 
associated 
with 
behavioral 
morbidity, 
we 
explored 
extensively 
the 
extent 
of 
confounding 
and 
effect 
modification 
caused 
by 
race. 
As 
only 
1 
interaction 
between 
race 
and 
SDB 
was 
statistically 
significant 
(CPRS-R:L 
Global 
Index 
Total 
subscale, 
an 
index 
of 
hyperactivity), 
the 
results 
suggest 
that 
the 
effect 
of 
SDB 
was 
comparable 
among 
black 
and 
nonblack 
subgroups. 
For 
the 
CPRS-R:L 
Global 
Index 
Total, 
among 
black 
children, 
the 
odds 
of 
a 
borderline 
or 
clinically 
abnormal 
score 
was 
3-fold 
higher 
in 
children 
with 
SDB 
compared 
with 
children 
without 
SDB. 
However, 
this 
difference 
was 
not 
seen 
in 
the 
specific 
Hyperactivity 
scale 
from 
the 
same 
instrument. 
The 
differential 
effect 
of 
SDB 
by 
race 
for 
the 
CPRS-R:L 
Global 
Index 
Total 
may 
be 
spurious 
or 
is 
possibly 


attributable 
to 
greater 
vulnerability 
among 
the 
SDB 
black 
subgroup 
to 
sleep 
disruption. 


Second, 
there 
may 
be 
methodologic 
limitations 
related 
to 
the 
behavioral 
assessments 
used 
in 
this 
study.43 
Although 
these 
measures 
provide 
reliable 
and 
valid 
assessments 
of 
behavioral 
problems, 
this 
validity 
is 
based 
largely 
on 
their 
ability 
to 
discriminate 
problem 
behaviors 
in 
clinically 
affected 
children 
versus 
nonreferred 
children 
on 
a 
range 
of 
symptoms. 
The 
instruments 
may 
have 
limited 
sensitivity 
to 
identify 
less 
serious 
behavioral 
problems 
that 
are 
below 
the 
threshold 
for 
clinical 
disturbance. 
Specifically, 
the 
CBCL 
was 
not 
designed 
to 
discriminate 
physical 
symptoms 
related 
to 
organic 
disorders 
from 
somatic 
symptoms 
created 
by 
emotional 
problems 
or 
stresses 
related 
to 
those 
same 
organic 
disorders. 
Moreover, 
the 
CBCL 
provides 
only 
limited 
assessment 
of 
social 
competence.43 
Despite 
these 
potential 
limitations, 
similar 
externalizing 
acting-out 
behaviors 
were 
identified 
by 
both 
the 
CBCL 
and 
the 
CPRS


R:L 
and 
persisted 
after 
adjustment 
for 
key 
covariates. 
Furthermore, 
the 
CBCL 
and 
CPRS-R:L 
both 
are 
validated 
measures 
of 
behavior 
disorders, 
and 
classifying 
children 
with 
borderline 
ratings 
as 
abnormal 
is 
likely 
to 
have 
increased 
their 
sensitivity 
to 
clinically 
meaningful 
problems.25,26 
A 
third 
limitation 
is 
a 
potential 
bias 
by 
reliance 
on 
parent 
reports.

of 
SDB 
included 
either 
parent 
report 
of 
habitual 
snoring 
or 
objectively 
measured 
OSA. 
Snoring 
may 
be 
differentially 
reported 
by 
parents 
according 
to 
any 
number 
of 
factors, 
including 
their 
attentiveness 
to 
their 
children’s 
sleep 
habits 
and 
underlying 
concerns 
about 
sleep 
and 
its 
possible 
impact 
on 
health 
and 
behavior. 
Given 
the 
increasing 
public 
awareness 
of 
the 
relationship 
between 
OSA 
and 
daytime 
problems, 
parents 
of 
children 
with 
behavioral 
problems 
may 
be 
more 
likely 
to 
report 
snoring. 
However, 
analyses 
were 
adjusted 
for 
maternal 
education 
and 
race/ethnicity, 
and 
any 
referral 
bias 
should 
be 
less 
in 
a 
community 
cohort 
than 
in 
a 
clinic-based 
sample. 


Fourth, 
our 
assessment 
of 
apnea 
hypopnea 
index 
was 
based 
on 
a 
single 
overnight, 
in-home, 
unattended, 
limited-channel 
cardiorespiratory 
recording. 
Unattended 
studies 
have 
been 
shown 
to 
be 
reliable 
for 
measuring 
apnea 
hypopnea 
indices 
in 
children.44 
Our 
preliminary 
validation 
studies 
showed 
excellent 
agreement 
in 
classifying 
SDB 
by 
apnea 
hypopnea 
indices 
from 
full 
laboratory-based 
polysomnography 
to 
technology 
selected 
for 
our 
limited-channel 
home 
studies.21 
Although 
nasal 
pressure 
technology 
may 
have 
provided 
a 
more 
sensitive 
index 
of 
airflow 
obstruction 
and 
hypopneas,45 
this 
sensor 
was 
not 
part 
of 
available 
ambulatory 
equipment 
at 
the 
time 
of 
this 
study’s 
data 
collection. 
Furthermore, 
a 
recent 
study 
of 
ambulatory 
unattended 
data 
collection 
in 
children 
found 
that 
the 
poorest 
signal 
quality 
came 
from 
the 
nasal 
cannula.44 
Had 
more 
sensitive 
measures 
of 
airflow 
been 
available, 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
some 
of 
the 
children 
with 
primary 
snoring 
may 
have 
been 
classified 
as 
having 
modest 
levels 
of 
OSA. 
However, 
our 
recordings 
were 
especially 
unlikely 
to 
misclassify 
children 
with 
moderate 
to 
severe 
levels 
of 
OSA, 
underscoring 
the 
validity 
of 
our 
conclusions 
regarding

associations 
between 
modest 
levels 
of 
SDB 
and 
behavioral 
outcomes. 
Because 
sleep 
and 
arousals 
were 
not 
measured, 
we 
could 
not 
separate 
the 
effects 
of 
respiratory 
abnormalities 
and 
sleep 
fragmentation 
on 
behavior. 
In 
summary, 
the 
limited-channel 
approach 
extends 
the 
data 
available 
from 
questionnaire 
studies, 
identifying 
significant 
associations 
between 
behavioral 
morbidity 
in 
children 
who 
are 
primary 
snorers, 
which 
did 
not 
seem 
to 
be 
explained 
by 
unrecognized 
moderate 
to 
severe 
levels 
of 
OSA. 


Fifth, 
we 
examined 
the 
relationship 
between 
SDB 
and 
each 
of 
the 
26 
behavioral 
outcomes 
without 
any 
adjustment 
for 
multiple 
testing. 
However, 
this 
analysis 
was 
exploratory 
and 
our 
primary 
interest 
was 
to 
estimate 
the 
association 
between 
SDB 
and 
behavioral 
problems 
after 
adjusting 
for 
confounders. 
Finally, 
the 
cross-sectional 
design 
of 
the 
study 
limits 
implications 
of 
the 
findings 
with 
regard 
to 
a 
causal 
relationship 
between 
SDB 
and 
behavioral 
problems. 


CONCLUSIONS 


Children 
with 
primary 
snoring 
and 
children 
with 
relatively 
mild 
degrees 
of 
OSA 
have 
an 
increased 
odds 
of 
behavioral 
problems 
compared 
with 
children 
without 
SDB, 
especially 
externalizing 
acting-
out 
behaviors 
that 
may 
have 
a 
negative 
impact 
on 
daytime 
functioning, 
learning, 
and 
school 
performance. 
Future 
large, 
well-controlled, 
prospective 
studies 
are 
needed 
to 
understand 
better 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
this 
association 
is 
causal, 
to 
examine 
the 
potential 
reversibility 
of 
associated 
behavioral 
problems, 
and 
to 
investigate 
cognitive 
consequences 
of 
SDB. 
Given 
the 
relatively 
high 
prevalence 
of 
SDB 
in 
school-aged 
children 
(2%),21 
any 
causal 
association 
would 
likely 
have 
a 
large 
public 
health 
impact, 
necessitating 
more 
aggressive 
screening, 
diagnosis, 
and 
treatment 
strategies 
aimed 
at 
identifying 
and 
treating 
a 
potentially 
treatable 
cause 
of 
behavioral 
problems. 
Even 
if 
not 
causal, 
these 
associations 
suggest 
a 
means 
for 
identifying 
children 
who 
are 
at 
increased 
risk 
for 
behavioral 
morbidity 
and 
might 
benefit 
from 
interventions. 
Given 
the 
association 
of 
behavior 
problems 
with 
difficulties 
in 
social 
adjustment 
and 
academic 
competence,46,47 
effective 
treatments 
may 
also 
yield 
improvement 
in 
other 
areas 
of 
functioning.

INVESTING 
IN 
YOUR 
ILLNESS 


“Cancer 
drug 
researchers 
are 
struggling 
with 
how 
to 
address 
a 
growing 
problem: 
cancer 
patients 
who 
buy 
stock 
in 
the 
manufacturers 
of 
drugs 
they 
themselves 
are 
taking 
as 
part 
of 
a 
clinical 
trial. 
Oncologists 
say 
they 
are 
increasingly 
hearing 
from 
trial 
participants 
who 
had 
reacted 
well 
to 
an 
experimental 
drug 
and 
then 
invested 
in 
the 
drug’s 
maker. 
The 
strategy 
is 
a 
byproduct 
of 
a 
surge 
in 
the 
number 
of 
clinical 
trials 
being 
conducted 
today. 
But 
many 
researchers 
say 
the 
practice 
raises 
serious 
ethical 
questions. 
A 
major 
concern 
is 
that 
patients 
who 
are 
also 
stock 
investors 
may 
play 
down 
toxic 
side 
effects 
they 
are 
experiencing—or 
play 
up 
the 
benefits—if 
they 
have 
a 
financial 
interest 
in 
the 
outcome 
of 
a 
trial. 
Researchers 
say 
that 
the 
integrity 
of 
the 
research 
could 
be 
questioned 
if 
it 
became 
known 
that 
a 
patient 
had 
invested 
in 
the 
drug 
being 
studied.”
