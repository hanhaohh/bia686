To 
investigate 
the 
prevalence 
of 
sleep 
disorders 
and 
their 
symptoms 
in 
children 
with 
headaches, 
64 
patients 
in 
the 
outpatient 
clinics 
of 
the 
University 
of 
Chicago 
Department 
of 
Pediatric 
Neurology 
were 
interviewed. 
Investigated 
disorders 
included 
excessive 
daytime 
sleepiness, 
narcolepsy, 
insomnia, 
sleep 
apnea, 
restlessness, 
and 
parasomnias. 
Unlike 
previous 
studies, 
subjects 
were 
compared 
with 
matched 
control 
patients 
by 
age 
and 
sex. 
Both 
headache 
and 
nonheadache 
groups 
completed 
a 
111-item 
questionnaire 
detailing 
sleep 
symptoms 
and 
behaviors. 
It 
was 
found 
that 
children 
with 
headaches 
have 
a 
significantly 
higher 
prevalence 
of 
excessive 
daytime 
sleepiness, 
narcolepsy, 
and 
insomnia 
than 
children 
without 
headaches 
(P 
< 
0.005), 
which 
is 
consistent 
with 
prior 
literature. 
A 
similar 
result 
was 
obtained 
in 
examining 
only 
migraines. 
However, 
we 
did 
not 
find 
a 
significantly 
higher 
prevalence 
of 
symptoms 
of 
sleep 
apnea, 
restlessness, 
and 
parasomnias, 
which 
contradicts 
previous 
literature. 
Also, 
the 
effect 
of 
medications 
taken 
by 
headache 
patients 
as 
a 
confounding 
factor 
was 
insignificant. 
Overall, 
pediatricians 
may 
find 
it 
beneficial 
to 
ask 
about 
daytime 
sleepiness, 
narcolepsy, 
and 
insomnia 
when 
treating 
a 
headache 
patient.

Introduction 


Both 
headache 
and 
sleep 
disorders 
are 
widespread 
problems 
in 
children. 
In 
fact, 
migraine 
and 
tension 
head


aches 
alone 
occur 
in 
12% 
of 
the 
pediatric 
population, 
and 
25% 
of 
children 
have 
experienced 
at 
least 
one 
type 
of 
sleep 
problem 
[1,2]. 
While 
the 
relationship 
between 
the 
two 
has 
not 
been 
firmly 
established, 
finding 
a 
link 
between 
the 
two 
afflictions 
would 
allow 
earlier 
identification 
and 
treatment 
of 
both 
problems. 
Although 
it 
may 
make 
sense 
that 
headache 
and 
sleep 
problems 
are 
related, 
there 
has 
actually 
been 
little 
research 
in 
this 
area. 
Paiva 
et 
al. 
found 
that 
headaches 
were 
frequent 
indicators 
of 
sleep 
disturbances, 
yet 
concluded 
that 
there 
was 
a 
complex 
relationship 
between 
the 
two 
[3]. 
Later 
studies 
reported 
similar 
results, 
and 
also 
acknowledged 
that 
the 
relationship 
between 
sleep 
disorders 
and 
headache 
is 
more 
than 
one 
of 
simple 
cause 
and 
effect. 


There 
are 
three 
possible 
relationships 
between 
the 
two 
clinical 
problems: 
that 
headaches 
cause 
sleep 
disorders, 
that 
sleep 
disorders 
cause 
headaches, 
and 
that 
both 
headaches 
and 
sleep 
disorders 
share 
a 
common 
intrinsic 
cause 
[4]. 
First, 
headaches 
as 
a 
cause 
of 
sleep 
disorders 
is 
less 
likely. 
Primary 
headache 
disorders, 
including 
migraine, 
tension-type, 
and 
cluster 
headaches, 
have 
not 
been 
observed 
to 
be 
the 
direct 
cause 
of 
major 
sleep 
disturbances 
unless 
there 
is 
depression 
from 
headaches 
or 
analgesic 
overuse 
[4,5]. 
Second, 
the 
converse 
of 
sleep 
disorders 
as 
a 
cause 
of 
headaches 
may 
possibly 
occur 
in 
some 
cases, 
particularly 
in 
the 
case 
of 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
through 
hypoxia 
causing 
morning 
or 
nocturnal 
headaches. 
In 
fact, 
these 
headaches 
have 
been 
successfully 
treated 
by 
first 
treating 
sleep 
apnea 
using 
continuous 
positive 
airway 
pressure 
or 
tonsillectomy 
or 
adenoidectomy, 
and 
also 
by 
treating 
the 
associated 
elevated 
end-tidal 
carbon 
dioxide 
levels 
[6]. 


However, 
it 
is 
more 
likely 
that 
headache 
and 
sleep 
disorders 
instead 
share 
a 
common 
intrinsic 
cause. 
Thus, 
they 
are 
related 
through 
“guilt 
by 
association” 
rather 
than

“guilt 
by 
causation” 
[4]. 
Both 
headache 
and 
sleep 
disorders 
have 
been 
thought 
to 
be 
triggered 
by 
neurotransmitter 
changes 
or 
circadian 
rhythm 
disruptions. 
Thus, 
both 
headache 
and 
sleep 
disorders 
may 
be 
concurrently 
affected 
by 
medications 
that 
affect 
neurotransmitters 
or 
seasonal 
changes. 


Serotonin 
levels 
have 
been 
demonstrated 
to 
affect 
both 
rapid 
eye 
movement 
(REM) 
sleep 
and 
migraines. 
Disruption 
of 
the 
cycle 
between 
REM 
and 
non-REM 
activity 
through 
serotonin 
imbalance 
could 
cause 
sleep 
disorders. 
For 
instance, 
narcolepsy 
involves 
the 
occurrence 
of 
REM-
like 
activity 
during 
the 
daytime. 
The 
dorsal 
raphe 
plays 
a 
regulatory 
role 
in 
REM 
sleep, 
producing 
serotonin 
only 
during 
REM 
sleep. 
Also 
serotonin 
was 
detected 
as 
it 
decreased 
REM 
sleep 
in 
rats, 
specifically 
through 
5 
hydroxy 
tryptophan 
(5-HT2) 
receptors 
in 
the 
laterodorsal 
tegmental 
nucleus 
[7]. 
Also, 
children 
have 
more 
REM 
sleep 
than 
adults, 
and 
thus 
may 
be 
affected 
differently 
[4]. 


Whereas 
serotonin 
regulates 
REM 
sleep, 
a 
decline 
in 
systemic 
serotonin 
levels 
has 
also 
been 
associated 
with 
migraine. 
During 
the 
onset 
of 
a 
migraine 
attack, 
the 
breakdown 
product 
of 
serotonin, 
5-hydroxyindoleacetic 
acid 
(5-HIAA), 
increases 
in 
the 
urine 
[4]. 
Positron 
emission 
tomography 
scans 
have 
demonstrated 
that 
serotonergic 
areas 
receive 
more 
blood 
flow 
during 
a 
migraine, 
and 
likewise, 
the 
injection 
of 
serotonin 
analogues 
relieved 
the 
migraine 
[8]. 
It 
is 
unclear 
what 
causes 
the 
dorsal 
raphe 
to 
stop 
secreting 
serotonin, 
but 
it 
has 
been 
demonstrated 
that 
the 
suprachiasmic 
nucleus 
regulates 
this 
release 
[4]. 
Combining 
the 
two 
above 
effects, 
a 
drop 
in 
serotonin 
can 
trigger 
both 
a 
migraine 
and 
a 
sleep 
disorders 
by 
affecting 
the 
REM 
sleep. 


Though 
this 
theory 
has 
not 
been 
demonstrated 
to 
explain 
the 
association 
between 
sleep 
and 
headache, 
recent 
clinical 
studies 
have 
definitely 
revealed 
some 
association 
[9]. 
Whereas 
most 
of 
these 
studies 
have 
been 
performed 
on 
adults, 
few 
have 
involved 
children. 
One 
of 
the 
first 
studies 
performed 
in 
pediatric 
patients 
found 
a 
higher 
prevalence 
of 
sleep 
disturbances 
in 
children 
with 
migraine, 
cluster, 
and 
tension 
headaches 
[10]. 
Another 
more 
recent 
study 
focused 
specifically 
on 
pediatric 
migraine 
patients 
using 
further 
characterization 
of 
severity 
and 
frequency 
of 
attacks 
[11]. 
This 
information 
has 
been 
demonstrated 
to 
be 
useful 
in 
therapy, 
and 
children 
receiving 
sleep 
hygiene 
education 
were 
found 
to 
have 
a 
lower 
prevalence 
of 
headaches 
than 
those 
without 
training 
[12]. 


However, 
these 
previous 
studies 
have 
not 
focused 
on 
actual 
primary 
sleep 
disorders. 
These 
studies 
only 
associate 
headache 
with 
sleep 
disturbance 
symptoms 
(e.g., 
snoring, 
grinding 
of 
teeth, 
co-sleeping 
with 
parent, 
nightmares). 
Also, 
age-and 
sex-matched 
control 
patients 
were 
not 
used. 
In 
the 
present 
study, 
a 
Pediatric 
Sleep 
Questionnaire 
was 
used 
to 
identify 
symptoms 
of 
primary 
sleep 
disorders 
(sleep 
apnea, 
insomnia, 
parasomnia, 
restless 
leg 
syndrome, 
narcolepsy, 
and 
excessive 
daytime 
sleepiness). 
Also, 
this 
study 
drew 
on 
a 
larger 
database 
of 
patients 
and 
uses 
age-matched 
control 
patients. 


The 
aim 
in 
this 
study 
was 
to 
investigate 
whether 
or 
not 
there 
was 
a 
significantly 
higher 
prevalence 
of 
primary 
sleep 
disorders 
in 
children 
with 
headache 
than 
children 
without 
headache. 
Finding 
a 
higher 
prevalence 
of 
sleep 
disorders 
in 
children 
with 
headache 
has 
useful 
clinical 
implications. 
In 
examining 
patients 
with 
headache, 
a 
sleep 
history 
may 
then 
be 
relevant 
to 
finding 
the 
best 
treatment 
for 
a 
patient. 


Methods 


Study 
Patients 


Between 
April 
and 
August 
2004, 
27 
patients 
with 
headache 
were 
recruited 
from 
outpatient 
pediatric 
neurology 
clinics 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Chicago 
Hospitals. 
Interviewers 
from 
the 
past 
few 
years 
had 
also 
encountered 
37 
patients 
with 
headaches. 
Headache 
patients 
were 
targeted 
either 
by 
prior 
chart 
review 
or 
citation 
of 
headache 
as 
a 
symptom 
during 
an 
appointment 
with 
their 
physician. 
Patients 
without 
neurologic 
problems 
had 
also 
been 
recruited 
from 
general 
pediatric 
clinics 
in 
past 
years, 
and 
these 
patients 
were 
the 
source 
of 
age-and 
sex-matched 
controls. 


Questionnaire 


After 
receiving 
informed 
consent 
from 
the 
legal 
guardian, 
patients 
were 
interviewed 
using 
a 
111-question 
Pediatric 
Sleep 
Questionnaire 
which 
has 
been 
approved 
by 
the 
Institutional 
Review 
Board. 
The 
Pediatric 
Sleep 
Questionnaire 
assesses 
a 
past 
history 
on 
medical 
conditions, 
medications, 
school 
history, 
and 
developmental 
history 
in 
addition 
to 
questions 
on 
sleep 
health. 
The 
sleep 
health 
section 
of 
the 
survey 
is 
divided 
into 
questions 
on 
bedtime, 
sleep-onset 
behavior, 
nighttime 
behavior, 
morning 
awakening, 
daytime 
behavior, 
and 
associated 
medical 
problems. 
However, 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
survey 
addressed 
the 
primary 
sleep 
disorders. 


Quantitative 
Analysis 


In 
the 
sleep 
health 
section, 
symptoms 
of 
these 
sleep 
disorders 
were 
scored 
on 
a 
0-4 
Likert-type 
scale 
(0: 
never; 
1: 
1-2 
times/month; 
2: 
1-2 
times/week; 
3: 
3-4 
times/week; 
4: 
nearly 
every 
day). 
Dependent 
on 
the 
frequency 
of 
certain 
symptoms, 
each 
patient 
received 
six 
separate 
scores 
for 
the 
sleep 
disorders 
insomnia, 
parasomnia, 
restlessness, 
excessive 
daytime 
sleepiness, 
narcolepsy, 
and 
sleep 
apnea 
by 
adding 
up 
the 
Likert 
scale 
items 
of 
corresponding 
symptoms 
(listed 
in 
Table 
1). 
Then, 
each 
general 
headache 
patient 
was 
matched 
to 
previously 
interviewed 
control 
patient 
by 
age 
and 
sex. 
Microsoft 
Excel 
was 
used 
to 
perform 
a 
two-tailed 
t 
test 
to 
determine 
P 
values 
for 
determining 
significant 
differences 
between 
headache 
and 
nonheadache 
patient 
sleep 
characteristics. 
The 
same 
test 
was 
also 
performed 
using 
only 
patients 
with 
migraine 
as 
diagnosed 
by 
a 
pediatric 
neurologist 
instead 
of 
general 
headache. 


Results 


Of 
the 
64 
pediatric 
headache 
patients 
recruited 
for 
this 
study, 
there 
were 
26 
females 
and 
38 
males 
(41% 
female, 
59% 
male) 
with 
an 
average 
age 
of 
10, 
all 
from 
the 
Chicago 
area 
or 
vicinity. 
The 
64 
matched 
control 
patients 
had 
the 
same 
age 
and 
sex 
as 
the 
headache 
patients. 


Overall, 
headache 
patients 
had 
a 
higher 
prevalence 
than 
nonheadache 
patients 
of 
four 
of 
the 
six 
studied 
sleep 
disorders. 
General 
headache 
patients 
had 
a 
significantly 
higher 
total 
disorder 
score 
(P

Looking 
specifically 
at 
18 
patients 
diagnosed 
with 
migraine 
by 
a 
pediatric 
neurologist, 
migraine 
patients 
produced 
a 
significantly 
higher 
disorder 
score 
for 
excessive 
daytime 
sleepiness 
and

There 
was 
no

between

in

(P

To 
investigate 
the 
possible

effects 
of 
medications, 
headache 
patients 
taking 
any 
medications 
were 
compared 
with 
headache 
patients 
taking 
no

There 
was 
no 
significant 
difference 
evident 
in 
any 
of 
the 
sleeping 
disorders 
(P

(Table

Several 
sleep 
characteristics 
were 
found 
to 
be 
significantly 
more 
frequent 
in 
headache 
patients. 
These 
symptoms 
were 
observed 
particularly 
as 
part 
of 
excessive 
daytime 
sleepiness 
and 
narcolepsy. 
Headache 
patients 
more 
frequently 
struggled

With

had 
trouble 
falling

awakened 
suddenly 
after

more

(P

and 
felt 
anxious 
about 
sleeping 
(P

Concerning 
sleep 
apnea, 
headache 
patients 
were 
more 
likely 
to 
sleep 
with 
their 
mouths 
open 
(P

Other 
sleep 
characteristics 
unrelated 
to 
any 
particular 
sleep 
disorder 
were 
also 
found 
to 
be 
significantly 
higher 
in 
headache 
sufferers. 
These 
patients 
were 
more 
likely 
to 
have 
a 
history 
of

problems, 
an 
inability 
to

More 
prominently,

the 
six 
sleep 
disorders 
studied. 
Specifically, 
a 
significantly 
higher 
prevalence 
of 
excessive 
daytime 
sleepiness, 
narcolepsy, 
and 
insomnia 
was 
documented 
in 
the 
general 
headache 
patients. 
Focusing 
specifically 
on 
migraine 
patients, 
a 
significant 
difference 
was 
evident 
only 
for 
excessive 
daytime 
sleepiness 
and 
narcolepsy. 
These 
findings 
are 
consistent 
with 
previous 
studies 
by 
Bruni 
et 
al. 
[10,12] 
which 
reported 
that 
excessive 
daytime 
sleepiness 
was 
higher 
in 
headache 
patients, 
and 
with 
Miller 
et 
al. 
[11], 
which 
determined 
that 
excessive 
daytime 
sleepiness 
was 
higher 
in 
migraine 
patients. 


However, 
the 
present 
study 
did 
not 
indicate 
a 
significant 
difference 
in 
restlessness, 
sleep 
apnea, 
or 
parasomnias 
between 
the 
general 
headache 
and 
nonheadache 
groups. 
This 
result 
fails 
to 
confirm 
the 
previous 
study 
by 
Bruni 
et 
al. 
[10], 
which 
found 
a 
higher 
prevalence 
of 
symptoms 
of 
three 
disorders 
in 
headache 
patients. 
Particularly, 
the 
previous 
study 
reported 
a 
higher 
prevalence 
of 
sleep 
breathing 
difficulties, 
nocturnal 
hyperkinesia, 
and 
parasomnia

observe 
significant 
differences 
with 
these 
symptoms. 
The 
reason 
for 
this 
contradiction 
is 
difficult 
to 
determine. 
This 
study 
used 
similar 
survey 
questions 
with 
a 
Likert-like 
scale 
for 
scoring 
of 
symptoms. 
Though 
the 
study 
by 
Bruni 
et 
al. 
used 
five 
times 
as 
many 
headache 
patients, 
our 
study 
matched 
each 
headache 
patient 
to 
a 
control 
patient 
by 
age 
and 
sex. 
Also, 
this 
previous 
study 
recruited 
patients 
from 
a 
specialized 
headache 
center, 
whereas 
the 
present 
study 
drew 
from 
a 
general 
pediatric 
neurology 
clinic, 
producing 
a 
difference 
in 
the 
patient 
sample. 
Overall, 
however, 
headache 
patients 
manifested 
more 
symptoms 
of 
sleeping 
disorders 
than 
nonheadache 
patients, 
and 
this 
was 
in 
accordance 
with 
previous 
literature. 


It 
is 
possible 
that 
insomnia 
in 
these 
patients 
is 
one 
of 
the 
causes 
of 
excessive 
daytime 
sleepiness 
because 
of 
sleep 
debt. 
Also, 
it 
appears 
that 
the 
symptoms 
of 
narcolepsy 
manifesting 
a 
higher 
prevalence 
are 
tied 
more 
closely 
to 
excessive 
daytime 
sleepiness 
than 
to 
a 
diagnosable 
disorder 
narcolepsy. 
Besides 
the 
irresistible 
urge 
to 
nap, 
other 
symptoms 
of 
narcolepsy 
are 
not 
present, 
such 
as 
paralysis 
in 
emotional 
situations 
and 
dreaming 
while 
awake. 
Still, 
there 
is 
a 
much 
higher 
prevalence 
of 
narcolepsy 
symptoms 
in 
headache 
patients. 


Explaining 
these 
findings 
is 
not 
simple 
because 
the 
relationship 
between 
headaches 
and 
sleep 
disorders 
is 
complex, 
with 
no 
clear 
cause 
and 
effect 
relationship. 
However, 
the 
most 
prominent 
theory 
of 
a 
“common 
intrinsic 
origin” 
may 
explain 
our 
findings 
if 
this 
origin 
causes 
both 
headaches 
and 
sleep 
disorders 
in 
the 
same 
patient 
[3]. 


Headache 
sufferers 
manifested 
a 
higher 
prevalence 
of 
excessive 
daytime 
sleepiness, 
narcolepsy, 
and 
insomnia, 
and 
all 
of 
these 
disorders 
involve 
disturbance 
of 
the 
sleep-wake 
cycle. 
Serotonin 
has 
been 
found 
to 
regulate 
sleep-wake 
cycles 
and 
to 
decrease 
the 
amount 
of 
REM 
sleep 
[13]. 
Similarly, 
decreases 
in 
serotonin 
levels 
in 
the 
brain 
have 
also 
been 
associated 
with 
migraines 
and 
tension 
headaches. 
Thus, 
a 
skewed 
level 
of 
serotonin 
may 
change 
the 
sleep-wake 
cycle, 
causing 
these 
three 
disorders. 
Also, 
using 
this 
theory, 
a 
serotonin 
decrease 
would 
not 
effect 
sleep 
apnea 
or 
restlessness, 
which 
involves 
a 
dopaminergic 
source. 
The 
source 
of 
this 
serotonin 
drop 
may 
be 
genetic 
and 
may 
also 
involve 
similar 
sleep-regulating 
neurotransmitters 
such 
as 
melatonin. 


Other 
explanations 
for 
this 
common 
origin 
could 
include 
anxiety 
or 
depression, 
which 
could 
cause 
both 
headaches 
and 
sleep 
disorders 
at 
the 
same 
time. 
Also, 
migraine 
patients 
have 
often 
used 
sleep 
as 
a 
method 
to 
abolish 
a 
headache. 
Repeatedly 
taking 
naps 
during 
the 
day, 
or 
even 
sleeping 
much 
earlier 
than 
usual 
could 
cause 
a 
disturbed 
sleep-wake 
cycle. 


A 
limitation 
of 
this 
study 
is 
the 
possible 
compounding 
effects 
of 
medications. 
Most 
headache 
patients 
were 
taking 
some 
form 
of 
pain 
relief 
or 
other 
drugs, 
including 
serotonin-selective 
reuptake 
inhibitors, 
which 
may 
induce 
side 
effects 
such 
as 
drowsiness. 
However, 
this 


finding 
does 
not 
explain 
the 
increased 
prevalence 
of 
insomnia 
that 
was 
observed. 
Also, 
it 
was 
found 
in 
this 
study 
that 
there 
were 
no 
significant 
differences 
in 
disorder 
scores 
between 
headache 
patients 
taking 
or 
not 
taking 
medications. 
Still, 
future 
research 
can 
determine 
the 
effect, 
if 
any, 
of 
medications 
and 
correct 
for 
any 
differences. 
Also, 
there 
may 
be 
some 
attention 
bias 
because 
parents 
of 
constant 
headache 
patients 
may 
be 
more 
observant 
of 
their 
child’s 
behavior 
than 
parents 
of 
nonheadache 
patients. 
This 
study 
was 
also 
limited 
to 
the 
Chicago 
area 
and 
vicinity, 
and 
to 
the 
spring 
and 
summer 
months. 
Finally, 
reports 
of 
a 
child’s 
nighttime 
behaviors 
involved 
in 
parasomnias, 
sleep 
apnea, 
restlessness, 
and 
insomnia 
are 
dependent 
on 
parental 
observation. 


Future 
research 
could 
include 
the 
use 
of 
more 
diverse 
locations 
for 
recruitment 
of 
patients. 
Also, 
physicians 
could 
determine 
whether 
or 
not 
treatment 
for 
narcolepsy, 
excessive 
daytime 
sleepiness, 
or 
insomnia 
helps 
to 
abolish 
headaches. 
Finally, 
the 
common 
cause 
of 
sleep 
disorders 
and 
headaches 
as 
serotonin 
could 
be 
investigated 
by 
using 
serotonin-receptor 
knockout 
mice 
or 
using 
drugs 
to 
decrease 
serotonin 
levels. 
Then, 
sleep 
quality 
and 
the 
sleep-wake 
cycle 
could 
be 
studied 
along 
with 
quantitative 
pain 
measurements 
such 
as 
cortisol 
levels. 


Overall, 
children 
with 
headaches 
were 
found 
to 
have 
more 
frequent 
symptoms 
of 
primary 
sleep 
disorders 
than 
children 
without 
headaches. 
Specifically, 
this 
study 
implicates 
a 
strong 
possible 
link 
between 
pediatric 
headaches 
daytime 
sleepiness 
and 
sleep 
quality. 
When 
evaluating 
a 
headache 
patient, 
pediatricians 
may 
find 
it 
beneficial 
to 
do 
a 
partial 
sleep 
history 
with 
a 
focus 
on 
symptoms 
of 
excessive 
daytime 
sleepiness, 
narcolepsy, 
or 
insomnia. 
The 
physician 
could 
ask 
a 
child 
with 
headaches 
questions 
such 
as, 
“Do 
you 
have 
trouble 
falling 
asleep?”, 
“Are 
you 
sleepy 
during 
the 
day 
or 
struggle 
to 
concentrate?”, 
and 
“Do 
headaches 
wake 
you 
up 
from 
sleep?”. 
Finally, 
treating 
an 
underlying 
sleep 
disorder 
may 
also 
treat 
the 
headache 
and 
ease 
the 
pain 
of 
the 
headache 
patient, 
improving 
daily 
function 
and 
quality 
of 
life 
for 
the 
child.
