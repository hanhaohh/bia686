Study Objectives: To collect normative data on the frequency of obstructive and mixed sleep apneas in healthy infants. 
Study Design: 1100 infants were recorded during one night in a sleep laboratory. 
Setting: the recordings were performed in an infant sleep laboratory. 
Patients: The recordings of 1023 infants were used for analysis, the data of 77 infants being excluded because of poor recording 
quality. The infants were born full-term, were healthy at the time of study, had no history of apnea and were aged between 2 and 
28 weeks. The polysomnographic recordings were analyzed visually and were subdivided according to the age of the subjects into 
2-7 weeks, 8-11 weeks, 12-15 weeks, 16-19 weeks and 20-27 weeks of life. 
Interventions: NA 
Measurements and Results: At 2-7 weeks of life, obstructive apneas (p=.013) and mixed apneas (p=.004) were significantly more 
frequent than at any other age group. At 8 to 11 weeks of life, obstructive apneas were significantly more frequent in boys than girls 
(p=.016). 
Conclusions: The present findings add to our knowledge of infants' respiratory characteristics during sleep.

INTRODUCTION 

A HIGH FREQUENCY OF OBSTRUCTIVE AND 
MIXED APNEAS WAS REPORTED IN INFANTS WHO 
DIED SUDDENLY DURING SLEEP,1-6 or suffered an 
apparent life-threatening event.3,6-9 The role of these apneas 
in the occurence of sleep-related events is still a matter of 
controversy, partly because of a lack of appropriate control 
subjects.2,5,10 There is a paucity of normative data on the 
frequency of obstructive and mixed sleep apneas in healthy 
infants.9-14 Available data suggests that these apneas are 
rare in healthy infants,11-14 occur in under 16% of newborns11 
and 10% of infants under six months of age.13 The 
obstructed breathing events are mainly seen in boys2,16,17 
during REM sleep.10,14,18 Their frequency decreases with 
advancing age.4,10,14,19 These findings are, however, not 
reported by all authors. Most discrepancies between studies 
appear to be related to differences in methodologies and to 
the relatively small number of healthy subjects studied in 

each survey.1,4,8,10,11,14,19 

The present prospective study was designed to evaluate 
the frequency of obstructive and mixed apneas in a large 
group of healthy infants under six months of age, recorded

METHODS 

Population studied 

Between December 1991 and August 1993, 1100 healthy 
infants were recorded during one night in a University 
Pediatric sleep laboratory following various research protocols 
on sleep characteristics. The families were informed 
of the possibility to join the study when leaving the maternity. 
The infants entered the study if they were born at term 
after a normal gestation, and if there was no family or personnal 
history of apnea, ALTE or SIDS. At the time of 
recording, they were aged between 2 and 27 weeks, were 
healthy, and received no medication. Each infant was studied 
only once. Following the sleep recording, all infants 
survived the first year of life with no history of apnea. 

Polygraphic recordings 

The infants were admitted to the sleep laboratory for an 
eight-hour night-time monitoring session performed in a 
quiet and darkened room, at an ambient temperature ranging 
between 20° C (68° F) and 23° C (73.4° F). All infants 
slept supine, without restraints. The infants slept alone in

the sleep laboratory. Recording started around 21:00h. The 
infants were observed continuously during recording. They 
were fed on demand; their behavior and any nursing intervention 
were charted. No infant had a pacifier during the 
recording sessions. The following variables were recorded 
simultaneously: two scalp electroencephalogram with central 
and occipital leads (C4/A1 and C3/A2), two electrooculograms, 
and electrocardiogram. Thoracic respiratory 
movements were measured by impedance and airflow 
with thermistors taped under both nostrils and on the side 
of the mouth. Oxygen saturation was recorded continuously 
by a transcutaneous sensor (Nellcor, USA). Gross body 
movements were measured using an actigram placed on 
one arm. The data was collected on a computerized infant 
sleep recorder (Alice recording system III, Healthdyne, 
USA). 

Analysis 

To fulfill the inclusion criterias, the sleep studies lasted 
at least 360 minutes, total sleep time exceeded 240 minutes, 
and technically adequate recordings were available for at 
least 90% of the total sleep time. Because they did not meet 
the above inclusion criteria, the data of 77 infants were 
excluded, leaving a total of 1023 recordings for analysis. 
The recordings were analyzed visually by two independent 
scorers to ensure reliability. Evaluation of the records was 
performed without knowledge of subjects age or sex. 
Interrater agreement in the scoring of individual obstructive 
and mixed apneas was 95%. Scoring discrepancies 

were discussed and codes thus agreed on were used in the 
data analysis. Thirty-second periods of the recordings were 
analyzed and classified as non-rapid eye movement 
(NREM) sleep, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, indeterminate 
or awake state, according to criteria recommended 
in the literature.15,19,20 Apneas were scored when they lasted 
three seconds or longer. Obstructive apneas (OAs) were 
scored when continuous deflections were obtained from the 
strain gauges, while a flat tracing was recorded from the 
thermistors. To avoid artificial scoring due to thermistor 
displacement, obstructive apneas preceded by body movements, 
crying, or a sigh were rejected. Mixed apneas 
(MAs) were scored when central apneas, defined as flat 
tracings from both the strain gauges and the thermistors, 
were directly followed by an obstructive apnea. The dura-

tion of MAs was computed by adding the duration of both 
apneas. The frequency of obstructive and mixed apneas 
was measured by dividing the total number of each type of 
apnea by the total sleep time in minutes and multiplied by 

60. The recordings were classified into five groups according 
to the age of the infants: 2-7, 8-11, 12-15, 16-19, or 2027 
weeks. Statistical assessments were done with the use of 
Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney, or Chi-square tests. The 
level of significance was p<0.05. 
RESULTS 

The main characteristics of the 1023 infants are shown 
in Table 1. Most infants were Caucasian (98%), and came 
from middle-class Belgian families (93%). Most mothers 
were married (98 %), 24% reported smoking during gestation. 
No differences were seen between the different age 
groups of infants, for the sex, gestational age, or median 
birth weights. At the time of study, the infants' weight 
(median percentile of 50, range 40 to 70) and height (median 
percentile of 50, range 35 to 80) were within normal values 
for the local population. As shown in Table 2, 53.3% of 
the infants had no OAs or MAs. No apnea was found in 21 
of 63 (33.3%) 2–7 week old infants, 252 of 521 (48.4%) 
8–11 week old, 100 of 238 (42.0%) 12–15 week, 57 of 137 

Figure 2—Frequency of mixed sleep apneas according to age. The data of the 
1023 infants are shown as 90th, 75th and 50th percentiles for age. 


(41.6%) 16–19 week old, and in 27 of 64 (42.2%) 20–27 
week old infants. In 46.7% of the subjects, either OAs or 
MAs were found. OAs were seen in 40.0 % of the infants, 
and MAs in 22.3%. In 15.8% of the infants, both OAs and 
MAs were scored. In all age groups, OAs were more frequent 
than MAs (at 2–7 weeks p=.032; at 8–11weeks 
p=.001; at 12–15 weeks p=.002; at 16–19 weeks p=.001 
for, and at 20–27 weeks p=.009). 

The frequency of OAs and of MAs are shown in Table 3. 
The number of apneas was small in each group. Most (65.5 
%) obstructive and mixed apneas occurred in infants 
younger than 12 weeks. The greatest frequencies of OAs 
and MAs were seen in the 2–7 weeks of age group (p=.013 
for OAs, and p=.004 for MAs). No differences in apnea frequencies 
were seen between 8–11, 12–15, 16–19, or 20–27 
weeks of life. The rate of decrease in apnea frequency with 
age was similar for the OAs and the MAs. Between the 27 
and the 8–11 weeks of life groups, the decrease in apnea 
frequency per hour of sleep, calculated on the 90th percentile 
of the apnea distribution, was - 49.3 % for the OAs, 
and - 48.3% for the MAs. In Figures 1 and 2, the frequency 
of all OAs and MAs are shown at the 90th, 75th, and 
50th percentiles for ages. When reanalyzing the frequencies 
of OAs and MAs between 2 and 7 weeks of life by two 
week intervals, the frequency of OAs, but not that of MAs,

tended to be greater at 2–3 weeks of age, than at 4–5 or 6–7 
weeks. When analyzing the distribution of apneas longer 
than 5 or 10 seconds, there were significantly more frequent 
OAs lasting over 5 seconds (p<.001) or 10 seconds 
(p<.001) in the 2–7 week age group, than in the later age 
groups (Table 5). 

The duration of obstructive and of mixed apneas tended 
to decrease with age (Figures 3 and 4). The longest duration 
of obstructive apneas was 13.5 seconds, that of mixed 
apneas 15 seconds. 

Between the ages of 8 to 11 weeks, more boys than girls 
had OAs (OAs were found in 120 of 247 boys, and 179 for 
274 girls; p=.001) (Table 4). The frequency of OAs per 
hour of sleep was also significantly greater in boys than in 
girls between 8 and 11 weeks of life (p=.003). No significant 
differences were seen in the other age groups. In the 
entire population, OAs were found in 44.5% of boys (209 
of 470 boys), and in 36.0% of girls (199 of 553 girls) 
(p=.006). No significant differences were seen between 
boys and girls for the frequency of mixed apneas. There 
were likewise no differences between boys and girls for the 
duration of obstructive or mixed apneas. 

The obstructive and mixed apneas occurred mainly during 
REM sleep (94.6% of OAs and 94.8% of MAs). The 
distribution of obstructive apneas through the night was 
analyzed by comparing the frequencies of apneas between 

21:00 and 00:00 hr, 00:01 and 03:00 or 03:01 and 06:00. 
Most obstructive apneas occurred between 00:01 hr and 
03:00 (p=.004). Mixed apneas were evenly distributed 
through the night (Figure 5). 
DISCUSSION 

The present study confirms that obstructive and mixed 
apneas are rare in healthy infants.1,2,8-11,14 Most previous 
studies were however done on small groups of infants and 
some studies did not differentiate obstructive from mixed 
events.4,8,10,11,14 In the present report, obstructive apneas 
were almost twice as frequently found than mixed apneas.

The infants under eight weeks of age had significantly 
more frequent obstructive events than older infants. The 
decrease in apnea frequency with age was also found in 
several studies,4,10,11,14,19,21,22 but was not reported by all 
authors. Guilleminault et al. reported an increase in 
obstructive and mixed apneas during night-time sleep at six 
weeks of age.8 In this transectional study only 10 healthy 
infants were recorded at the age of six weeks. 

All obstructed events were relatively brief and rarely 
exceeded 10 seconds. Their duration decreased progressively 
with age. These results are consistent with some previous 
reports.4,8,10,11,14,22 However, Hoppenbrouwers et al., 
found no decrease in the duration of obstructive events at 
one, three, and six months of life.10 This observation, based 
on the study of 14 term infants, showed a high intra-group 
variability. These previous studies were characterized by 
large intersubject variabilities and standard deviations from 
mean values. The discrepancies in findings with these previous 
studies could mainly be related to the number of 
infants evaluated. The large number of infants included in 
the present survey corrected for intersubject and intragroups 
variabilities.

SLEEP, Vol. 23, No. 4, 2000 4 Frequency of Obstructive & Mixed Sleep Apneas in 1,023 Infants—Kato et al 


In the present survey significantly more boys than girls 
had obstructive sleep apneas, and boys had also more 
obstructive sleep apneas per hour of sleep than girls. The 
more frequent obstructive sleep apneas seen in males subjects 
was reported in infants2,15,17 and in adults.24,25 The 
findings remain unexplained and were tentatively attributed 
to gender-related differences in metabolic rates,26 sex 
hormones,27 or maturation of central breathing controls.26 

In the present study, when analyzing the data by age 
groups, the greater frequency of obstructive apneas seen in 
boys was significant between the ages of 8 to 11 weeks 
only. We cannot explain this age-related relation that had 
not been previously reported. It is in this age range that 
most sudden deaths and sleep apneas events occur. These 
clinical events are also seen significantly more frequently 
in boys than in girls.28 

Several limitations should be admitted in our study. 
First, the scoring of polygraphic studies depends on recording 
techniques, definitions of events and skill of the scorers.
15 In the present study the obstructed breathing events 
were detected with the use of standard techniques.18,29 Only 
one night of recording was analyzed per infant, as it was 
shown that a single night study was adequate for the evaluation 
of sleep apneas frequency in infants.14,15,30,31 The 
analysis was done visually for optimal efficiency of scoring.
32 Care was taken to exclude artifacts due to head 
movements and thermistor displacements. Some obstructive 
apneas may thus have been unduly excluded from the 
study. The technicians were well trained, discussed discrepancies, 
and high levels of inter-rater agreement were 
reached.29,33 Secondly, our recording techniques did not 
allow for the identification of episodes of hypopnea,34 or 
increased upper airway resistances without complete occlusion 
or desaturation.15,35 Thirdly, because of a smaller number 
of subjects in the 2 to 7, and 20 to 27 week age groups, 
some significant findings, such as gender-related differences 
in apnea frequencies could have been masked. 
Finally, the medical significance of the obstructive apneas 
cannot be derived from our study, but all infants were considered 
healthy at the time of recording and survived the 
first year of life. 

With these limitations in mind, the present study 
describes for the first time the frequency of obstructive and 
mixed sleep apneas in a large group of healthy infants, and 
showed that between the ages of 8 and 11 weeks of life 
obstructive sleep apneas were significantly more frequent 
in boys than in girls. The data could be of interest for the 
evaluation of sleep studies in infants. It remains to be determined 
whether the present findings contribute to our understanding 
of the characteristics of sudden infant deaths during 
sleep.28
