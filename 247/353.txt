Objectif : Déterminer, chez un sous-groupe connu d’enfants, si 
l’heure à laquelle l’amygdalectomie a été réalisée pour un syndrome 
sévère d’apnée obstructive du sommeil (SAOS) a un effet sur l’incidence 
de complications respiratoires postopératoires. 

Éléments cliniques : Des enfants subissant une amygdalectomie 
ont été inclus dans notre étude si un diagnostic polysomnographique 
de SAOS sévère avait été établi dans les six mois avant l’opération. Les 
patients admis ont été répartis selon l’occurrence de désaturation 
postopératoire dans un groupe de saturation (SAT) ou de désaturation 
(deSAT). Les dossiers des enfants du groupe deSAT ont été révisés. 
L’heure de l’opération a été notée sous matin (AM) ou après-midi 
(PM). 

Résultats : Ont été admis à l’étude, 88 patients dont 31 filles et 57 
garçons. La moyenne d’âge et de poids ± l’écart type étaient respectivement 
de 4,6 ± 2,9 ans et 20,8 ± 14,5 kg. Il y a eu 63 enfants dans 
le groupe SAT et 25 dans le groupe deSAT. Les différences d’âge, de poids 
et de sexe n’étaient pas significatives. Le niveau préopératoire minimal 
de saturation en oxygène (SaO2) a été de 80,8 ± 10,2 % et de 67,6 
± 17,5 % (P < 0,05) dans les groupes SAT et deSAT respectivement. 
Les indices d’apnée obstructive et d’hypopnée préopératoires étaient de 
15,8 ± 10,2 et de 35,7 ± 34,6 événements·h-1 (P < 0,05), respectivement. 
L’opération de 63 (71,6 %) enfants s’est faite en AM. Une 
analyse univariée de régression logistique a considéré l’opération réalisée 
en PM [risque relatif (RR) de 4,6, intervalle de confiance (IC) de 95 %, 
1,7 à 12,6, P = 0,002] et un niveau minimal de SaO2 préopératoire < 
80 % (RR de 3,6, IC de 95 %, 1,4 à 9,4, P = 0,009) comme des facteurs 
de risque prédictifs de désaturation postamygdalectomie. 

Conclusion : Les enfants atteints d’un SAOS sévère, opérés en AM, 
sont moins susceptibles de subir une désaturation postamygdalectomie 
que les enfants opérés en PM.

Koomson et al.: TIMING OF ADENOTONSILLECTOMY 

A 
A 
DENOTONSILLECTOMY is one of the 
commonest operations performed in children 
with the annual caseload in excess of 

a quarter million in the USA alone.1 In the 

UK about 2.3/1,000 children under the age of 12 yr 
undergo tonsillectomy annually.2 

Children with the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome 
(OSAS) have a higher risk for respiratory morbidity 
following adenotonsillectomy compared with 
the general pediatric population.3–5 Quality assurance 
programs have focused attention on patient characteristics 
contributing to postoperative risk.6 An evolving 
viewpoint emphasizes the need to look beyond the 
patient, to factors in the health delivery system per se, 
which may affect outcome. Newland et al.7 reported 
that surgery performed after 15:00 hr was associated 
with a higher risk for anesthetic-related cardiac arrest. 
Using our large database of children with OSAS who 
have undergone adenotonsillectomy, we aimed to 
assess the time of day of surgery as an independent risk 
factor for postadenotonsillectomy respiratory morbidity. 
A second aim was to examine the time interval 
between postoperative opioid administration and respiratory 
outcome.

The study received Institutional approval. 

Patient selection criteria 

The selected patients represent a subset of children 
previously reported.5 The inclusion criteria were: 1) a 
sleep study documenting severe OSAS; 2) adenotonsillectomy 
within six months prior to surgery; and 3) 
extubation in the operating room at the end of 
surgery. The diagnostic criterion for severe OSAS was 
an abnormal sleep study defined, in our institution 
and elsewhere,8 by an obstructive apnea and hypopnea 
(OAH) index > 5 events·hr–1. 

Chart review and study parameters 

DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR OSAS 
A diagnosis of OSAS was made with either 
polysomnography performed in the sleep laboratory 
or a cardiorespiratory sleep study performed in the 
home. Details of our sleep study recording systems 
have been published elsewhere.9–12 Although the studies 
were analyzed for several variables,5 only the OAH 
index and the preoperative saturation nadir (preSaO2 
nadir) are reported. The preSaO2 nadir was defined as 
the minimum hemoglobin oxygen saturation regardless 
of duration and was validated by visual inspection 
of a computerized data record.10,13 

POSTOPERATIVE CARE FOLLOWING ADENOTONSILLECTOMY 
It is our practice to extubate children when awake in 
the operating room and to administer oxygen by face-
mask, attached to a Jackson Rees circuit, placed in 
close proximity to the child’s face for the initial postoperative 
period. We administer iv morphine, in 
repeated doses (0.05 mg·kg–1), as the opioid of choice 
in the postoperative care unit until the child is able to 
tolerate oral codeine. In addition we monitor all children 
with a diagnosis of OSAS with an Nellcor N200 
oximeter (Nellcor, Pleasanton, CA, USA) on the first 
postoperative night. Postoperative events of interest 
included both respiratory complications and medical 
interventions. Postoperative respiratory desaturation 
was defined as a room air oxygen saturation less than 
95%. Administration of oxygen, insertion of an 
oropharyngeal airway, reintubation and ventilation 
were considered medical interventions. 

MEDICAL CHART REVIEW 
The children were divided into two groups based on 
the presence of postoperative desaturation into a desaturated 
(deSAT) or saturated (SAT) group. Desaturation 
which occurred before the child left the operating 
room, did not influence the grouping criteria. 

Pertinent history, operative and postoperative 
information were recorded including the start time of 
the operative procedure. Outcome was assessed from 
written reports in the nursing and medical records. A 
review of medical charts was conducted for children in 
the deSAT group. The number of desaturations in the 
first 24 hr postoperative period, as documented in the 
medical chart, were recorded by a pediatric anesthesiologist 
(A.K.). The clock time of opioid administration 
and the clock time at which a respiratory 
complication occurred were recorded. The temporal 
relationship between opioid administration and the 
first (postdeSAT1st) and minimum (postSaO2 nadir) 
were determined. The “sleep state” reported in the 
nursing charts as “awake” or “asleep” at the time of 
desaturation was noted. 

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POSTOPERATIVE MORPHINE 
ADMINISTRATION AND POSTOPERATIVE 
DESATURATION 
Children who did not desaturate in the postoperative 
period (group SAT) were assigned a value for 
postSaO2 nadir of 95%. The difference between the 
postdeSAT1st and postSaO2 nadir was calculated. The 
time intervals: 1) between the postSaO2 nadir1st and 
opioid administration immediately preceding it 
(Interval1st); and 2) between the postSaO2 nadir and

Box plot distribution of data for the start time of surgery in group

post oxygen saturation (SaO2) nadir occurred in group deSAT. 
The median clock time for the postSaO2 nadir was 23:00 hr. 

opioid administration immediately preceding the 
episode (Intervalnadir) were calculated. Opioid dosing 
was converted to equianalgesic morphine doses, such 
that the relative potencies for codeine, fentanyl and 
sufentanil were 0.1, 100 and 1,000 respectively.14 The 
mean dose of opioid, administered in the initial three 
hours, was calculated as the sum of the intraoperative 
plus the first two postoperative hours (opioid-three 
hours) dose. The mean dose of opioid, administered 
in a 24-hr period during and following surgery (opioid-
24) was also calculated. 

Statistical analysis 

The variables were analyzed using SAS for Windows 
(version 8.02, SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). 
Categorical data were summarized using frequencies 
and continuous variables were reported as mean ± SD 
or ranges. 

Known risk factors namely young age, a low oxygen 
saturation nadir and an associated medical condition, 
were categorized as age risk (< 3 yr or $ 
3 yr), oxygen 
saturation (SaO2) nadir risk (< 80% or $ 
80%) and associated 
medical condition risk (yes vs no).3,4 Surgery performed 
between 7:45 and 12:59 was designated 
morning (AM) and after 13:00 was designated afternoon 
(PM). The season for surgery performed between 
October and March was assigned to winter and for 
surgery performed between April and September was 
assigned to summer. Since the majority of children 
received postoperative opioids, opioid administration 
could not be evaluated as an independent risk factor. 
Opioid dosing, converted to morphine equivalents, was 
treated as a continuous variable.

The main outcome was the occurrence of desaturation 
following adenotonsillectomy. Risk factors were 
first evaluated with univariate analysis followed by 
multivariate logistic regression.15 Associations were

There were 31 girls and 57 boys. The mean ± SD age 
(yr) and weight (kg) were 4.6 ± 2.9 yr and 20.8 ± 14.5 
kg, respectively. Twenty-seven percent (n = 24) of 
children had an associated medical condition (asthma 
= 13, cardiac = 2, neuromuscular = 1). The preoperative 
SaO2 nadir was 77.1% ± 13.9 (range 20%–90%). 
The preoperative OAH index was 21.5 ± 22.0 (range 
5–142.2) events·hr–1. 

The hospital stay was 38.6 ± 34.9 hr. The minimum 
stay in hospital was eight hours. Sixty-six children 
were discharged prior to 24 hr postoperatively. 
Four children were discharged the same day of 
surgery, 9.9 ± 1.4 hr after surgery. (SaO2 nadir = 
82.8% ± 12.7, OAH index = 14.6 ± 12.3 events·hr–1). 
Sixty-two children were discharged the AM following 
surgery, mean stay in hospital was 23.4 ± 9.4 hr (SaO2 
nadir = 79.0 ± 12%, OAH index = 16.2 ± 10.7 
events·hr–1). 

There were 63 (71.6%) patients who did not experience 
postoperative desaturation (SAT group) and 25 
(28.4%) children who did (deSAT group). The distribution 
of known and potential risk factors is given in 
Table I. Differences in age, weight, gender and the 
presence of an associated medical condition were not 
significant. The preoperative SaO2 nadir for the SAT 
and deSAT groups was 80.8 ± 10.2% and 67.6 ± 
17.5%, respectively (P < 0.05). The preoperative OAH 
index was 15.8 ± 10.2 and 35.7 ± 34.6 events·hr–1, 
respectively (P < 0.05). 

Surgery was performed in the winter season in 45 
(51%) children. The mean ± SD duration of surgery 
was 49.1 ± 11.5 min. Differences in the duration of 
surgery were not significant. Surgery was performed 
in the AM in 63 (71.6%) children. The time of surgery 
(24 hr clock) for groups SAT and deSAT was 11:24 ± 

2.03 hr and 13:09 ± 2.7 hr, respectively. 
The anesthetic technique varied. An iv induction 
was used in 62.5% of children (n = 55). Propofol was 
administered to 60 children whereas sodium pentothal 
was used in 18. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane 
(n = 23), halothane (n = 59) or sevoflurane (n = 
4) and unrecorded in two. The trachea of all children 
were intubated for the adenotonsillectomy. Atropine 
was administered at induction of anesthesia in 63% (n 
= 55) of children. Non-opioid adjuncts were administered 
to 44 children (acetaminophen = 19, ketorolac

= 25). Seventy-one children received a muscle relaxant 
(atracurium = 1, rocuronium = 43, vecuronium = 13, 
succinylcholine = 14). Thirty-seven (65%) children 
who had received a nondepolarizing muscle relaxant 
did not receive a reversal agent. Seventy-six (86.4%) 
children received an intraoperative opioid (morphine 
= 6, fentanyl = 37, sufentanil = 31, codeine = 2). 
Differences in anesthetic management between the 
SAT and deSAT groups were not significant. 

In the postoperative period 87 children received 
acetaminophen. Antiemetics were administered to a 
minority of children (droperidol = 4, dimenhydrinate 
= 1). Seven (8%) children (group SAT = 3, group 
deSAT = 4) did not require any postoperative opioid 
in the first 24 hr. Sixty-nine (78.4%) children received 
an opioid in the first two postoperative hours (morphine 
= 66, meperidine = 1, codeine = 2). Oral 
codeine was the most frequently administered opioid 
beyond the initial two postoperative hours (codeine = 
62, morphine = 1). 

The main outcome was the occurrence of postoperative 
desaturation. Univariate analysis of known3,4 and 
potential risk factors identified two risk factors: the preoperative 
SaO2 nadir risk (< 80% vs $ 
80%) and the time 
of day of surgery (PM vs AM; Table II). These risk factors 
remained significant when analyzed with a multivariate 
analysis. In addition, multivariate analysis gave 
an OR for the season (winter vs summer) of 0.27, (95% 
confidence interval 0.08–0.94, P = 0.04). 

Secondary analysis of the mean number of desaturations 
recorded for the first postoperative 24-hr period, 
was 2.0 ± 1.0. Overall the value for the postSaO2 
nadir was 16.2 ± 13.0% higher than the preSaO2 nadir. 
The postdeSAT1st and postSaO2 nadir were 90.4 ± 
4.3% and 88.6 ± 4.6% respectively. The median clock 
time for the first and minimum desaturation was 

17:30 and 23:00, respectively (Figure 1). The median 
time interval between surgery and respiratory complications 
was 3.3 hr (range 67 min to 21 hr). The time 
interval between the first and minimum postoperative 
desaturation ranged from 0 to 13 hr (2.5 ± 3.8 hr). 
Eighteen (72%) patients were asleep at the time of 
postdeSAT1st and 21 (84%) patients were asleep at the 
time of the postSaO2 nadir. 
Four (16%) patients had received no opioid prior to 
the postoperative desaturation. The mean dose for 
opioid-three hours (morphine equivalents, mg·kg–1) 
was 0.21 ± 0.13 and for opioid 24 hr (morphine 
equivalents, mg·kg–1) was 0.48 ± 0.30. Differences in 
opioid dosing between groups SAT and deSAT were 
not significant. The time interval between opioid 
administration and the first postoperative desaturation 
was 4.2 ± 4.5 hr (range 0.5–17.3 hr). 

The medical interventions required in the deSAT 
group were O2 administration (n = 25) and airway 
instrumentation (oropharyngeal airway = 2, bag and 
mask ventilation = 4, reintubation = 1).

This report has several limitations inherent in a retrospective 
review. Recording of events may not be complete 
and it is likely that we under report the true incidence of 


desaturation. In addition, it was not possible to report 
reliable data on a history of recent upper airway infections, 
which might have influenced the occurrence of 
desaturation following surgery.16,17 We used a threshold 
of 95% to define postoperative desaturation, since this 
threshold is a criterion for discharge in our institution. 
Overall the postoperative saturation nadir increased 16% 
from the preoperative SaO2 nadir, a finding which is in 
agreement with that of Helfaer et al.18 However, one 
third of children in our study desaturated < 95% on the 
first postoperative night and were given O2. 

Several factors may have contributed to desaturation 
in the postoperative period, including severity of 
OSAS, and the time of day at which surgery occurred. 

OSAS severity 

Although we sought to restrict the analysis to a 
homogenous population of children with severe OSAS, 
the fact that preSaO2 nadir was lower and the OAH 
index higher in the deSAT group suggests our population 
of severe OSAS was not as homogeneous a population 
as intended. In this regard, there is an emerging 
consensus that OSAS severity is an independent risk factor 
for respiratory morbidity.3,4,18,19 Furthermore the 
criteria for stratification of OSAS disease severity for 
diagnosis and prediction of postoperative respiratory 
morbidity probably differ. As an example, the criterion 
for a diagnosis of severe OSAS is an OAH index > 5 
events·hr,–1 20 whereas that for prediction of postadenotonsillectomy 
respiratory morbidity is an OAH index > 
10 events·hr–1.4 There is a need to develop criteria 
applicable to an operative setting which define perioperative 
risk stratification in OSAS. 

Time of day of surgery 

Surgery performed in the AM in children with severe 
OSAS was associated with a lower risk for postoperative 
desaturation compared with those having their 
operation in the PM and we propose two explanations 
for this finding. First, children who are operated on in 
the AM have a longer time to recover from the effects 
of anesthesia before their first postoperative nocturnal 
sleep. Second, postoperative children may be better 
observed by day staff and alert parents early in the day. 

The shortened time interval, between postoperative 
morphine dosing and bedtime, imposed by PM 
surgery may have contributed to the incidence of 
postoperative desaturation, given the exaggerated respiratory 
depression to opioids which has recently been 
reported in children with severe OSAS.21 It is noteworthy 
that the majority of desaturation (72%) 
occurred during sleep. Pediatric OSAS is a disease of 
rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Proportionally, 

CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ANESTHESIA 

REM sleep increases and respiratory function is at its 
nadir, later in the sleep period.12,22 There is a strong 
possibility that the combination of opioids and sleep 
promote desaturation following adenotonsillectomy 
in children with severe OSAS. 

A recent study reported that hospital admissions 
and surgeries performed on weekends were associated 
with a higher mortality than on weekdays, a finding 
attributed to lower staffing patterns on weekends.23 
The median clock time at which the postSaO2 nadir 
occurred was 23:00 hr, coincident with the lowest 
staffing ratio. The child with severe OSAS may benefit 
from the close supervision afforded by a high nurse 
and physician staffing ratio.

Children with severe OSAS whose surgery is performed 
in the AM are less likely to desaturate following 
adenotonsillectomy than children whose surgery is 
performed in the PM. Surgery performed in the AM, 
could represent a cost-effective risk reduction strategy 
to decrease postadenotonsillectomy respiratory complications 
in children with severe OSAS which merits 
prospective study.
