variables recorded, the current work focuses on the 
nadir oxygen saturation (SaO2 nadir). The SaO2 nadir was 
validated by visual inspection of a computerized data 
record and was defined as the minimal hemoglobin oxygen 
saturation, regardless of its duration. A validated 
SaO2 nadir was also determined from the event graphs 
obtained from oximetry studies.11,14 
Anesthetic Management 

Children were included in this study if they had no 
pathology other than OSA. No child was premedicated. 
All children had general anesthesia for their adenotonsillectomy, 
tracheal intubation with assisted ventilation, 
short-acting opioids during the induction of anesthesia, 
nitrous oxide with isoflurane or sevoflurane throughout 
anesthesia, tracheal extubation on awakening from anesthesia 
in the operating room, and the use of morphine 
as the parenteral, postoperative analgesic. The intravenous 
opioid administered during surgery was fentanyl or 
sufentanil (duration of action . 
30 min15). The doses of 
these drugs were expressed as morphine equivalents, 
such that 0.001 mg fentanyl and 0.0001 mg sufentanil 
were equipotent to 0.1 mg morphine.15 Adjunct medications 
given intraoperatively that may have influenced 
postoperative morphine dosing included acetaminophen, 
ketorolac, ketamine, and dexamethasone.16–19 
Postoperative pain was treated in accordance with a 
physician-prescribed morphine dose, which was repeated 
at 10-min intervals resulting in a cumulative postoperative 
morphine dose necessary to achieve a Children’s 
Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Score of 6 (i.e., 
cessation of crying, moaning, grimacing, restlessness, 
and verbal reports of pain) or subjective comfort (denying 
pain).20 

Statistical Analysis 

The anthropomorphic characteristics of the patients 
and all other data were described as mean . 
SD. The 
normality of the distribution of each variable was tested 
with the Shapiro-Wilk W test. The potential effect of the 
adjunct medications in their various combinations on the 
morphine dose was tested with one-way analysis of variance. 
The potential influence of the intraoperative morphine 
equivalent on the cumulative postoperative morphine 
dose was tested using regression analysis. 

The relation of the predictor variables, namely, age, 
preoperative SaO2 nadir, intraoperative morphine equivalent, 
acetaminophen, ketorolac, ketamine, and dexamethasone, 
to the morphine dose was examined by 
multiple regression as well as a backward stepwise multiple 
regression procedure (Statistica, version 6; StatSoft,

Results 

Forty-six (16 girls) out of the 102 consecutive children 
who underwent adenotonsillectomy between November 
2001 and December 2002 met the inclusion criteria 
set for the current study. The diagnosis of OSA was made 
by oximetry alone (n . 
25), by a combination of oximetry 
and sleep studies (n . 
17), or, in those children 
who displayed near normal oxygen saturation, from the 
apnea/hypopnea index (8.0 . 
6.0 events/h; n . 
4). 

The anthropomorphic characteristics of the children 
included in this study as well as data related to their 
surgery, the intraoperative fentanyl (n .

the adjunct medication regimen, and cumulative 
postoperative morphine dosing are presented in table 1. 
Age and the apnea/hypopnea index were the only variables 
that displayed a normal distribution. The adjunct 
medications used intraoperatively in various combinations 
did not influence the corresponding morphine 
doses required for analgesia (table 2). There was no

There was no significant correlation among the predictor

Discussion 

The specific question that we have attempted to answer 
in the current work has been whether recurrent 
hypoxemia, such as occurs in OSA,1–5 alters sensitivity to 
opioid analgesics. Because of the nature of this question, 
we adhered to strict criteria in the selection of the 
patient population. First, we eliminated all patients who 
had concomitant disease, including asthma. Second, in 
striving to study a homogeneous patient population, we 
restricted our analysis to those who underwent adenotonsillectomy. 
Third, we limited our patient population 
at surgery to those who had received short-acting opioids 
on induction of anesthesia. It is because of these 
strict inclusion criteria that the number of children included 
in this study was reduced from the total of 102 
consecutive patients to 46. 

The lack of morphine-sparing effects usually attributed 
to the adjunct medications16–19 may be explained by the 
following considerations: (1) ketorolac and ketamine 
were given only to a minority of the children; (2) dexamethasone 
was used at a lower dose than that reported 
to have a morphine-sparing effect19; and (3) the narrow 
dose range of acetaminophen administered to the majority 
of the children precluded the demonstration of a 
morphine-sparing effect. 

There was no evidence that a child’s age or the severity 

of oxygen desaturation biased the intraoperative opioid 
regimen, nor was there any evidence for bias in the 
physicians’ prescription or in the nurses’ administration 
of postoperative morphine. 

The lack of correlation between the short-acting opioids 
used intraoperatively and the cumulative postoperative 
morphine dose (fig. 1) can be explained by the 
brief duration of action of fentanyl and sufentanil15,21 
and by the time interval between their intraoperative 
administration and the postoperative requirement for 
analgesia (table 1). 

The striking finding of this study, that the cumulative 
postoperative dose of morphine required for analgesia 
was significantly correlated to both the child’s age and 
preoperative oxygen saturation, has led us to propose 
that these variables might be associated in some causal 
and mechanistic fashion. Whereas, obviously, it is impossible 
at this point to report molecular brain mechanisms 
in these children, an analogy with findings in animal 
models may be useful. Before such an analogy is made, 
however, the appropriateness of the animal model must 
be established. From this point of view, postnatal swine 
seem to be optimal models because their stage of brain 
development at birth seems to simulate that in full-term 
infants,22 and their postnatal maturation in autonomic 
functions, such as sleep–wake and respiratory and cardiovascular 
behaviors, follows patterns similar to those 
in infants and children, albeit on a shortened time 
scale.23,24 

In the chronically instrumented and unsedated piglet 
model, recurrent daily exposure to intermittent hypoxia 
has been shown to increase the binding of a specific 
agonist to -opioid receptors in several brainstem regions.
9 Such increased binding can be caused either by 
an increased affinity between the agonist and the receptor 
that might prolong the association between the two 
or by an increase in the number of receptors. Because 
there was no change in receptor affinity,9 this increase in 
binding density can be attributed to an increase in the 
number of membrane-bound -opioid receptors. Such 
an increase may reduce the dose of an exogenous opioid 
required to accomplish a specific physiologic effect. 
Whereas in the above-mentioned study only respiratory-

related -opioid receptors were studied, it is not unreasonable 
to suggest that pain-related -opioid receptors 
might behave in a similar fashion. Therefore, a hypoxiainduced 
increased number of pain-related -opioid receptors 
in children with severe OSA might explain a 
heightened sensitivity to postoperative morphine given 
for analgesia. 

The correlation between age and cumulative postoperative 
morphine dosage cannot be explained by an 
age-related change in the density of -opioid receptors 
because these do not increase over the age range studied 
either in pigs or in humans.25,26 This correlation may be 
explained, however, by the ontogeny of opioid neuropeptides 
in the brain. In the same piglet model, we 
have shown in respiratory-related brain regions that the 
content of the opioid peptide . 
endorphin, which displays 
a preferred -opioid activity, and methionine-enkephalin, 
with both -and -opioid activity, is highest at 
birth, decreasing with postnatal age.27 By extending the 
analogy of neuropeptide ontogeny to the current study 
and assuming similar ontogeny in pain-related brain regions, 
it is attractive to speculate that a higher level of 
endogenous ligands might reduce the amount of exogenous 
agonist required for a given physiologic effect. In 
extending this rationale to the current study, a relatively 
higher endogenous -opioid content in the younger children 
might have contributed to the lower required morphine 
dose independently of preoperative oxygen 
saturation. 

The clinical relevance of our findings lies in the high 
incidence of respiratory complications reported in children 
with severe OSA after postoperative morphine administration.
8 Whereas the underlying mechanism of 
such complications is as yet unknown, it seems reasonable 
to speculate that at least some of those were related 
to the postoperative opioid regimen. If opioid requirement 
is lowered by youth and oxygen desaturation, as 
our study has shown, a normally recommended morphine 
dose for analgesia may be excessive for young 
children with severe OSA, thus producing respiratory 
depression. Whereas the current study lacks sufficient 
power to reliably report on the relation between age, 
preoperative oxygen desaturation, morphine dosing, 
and postoperative respiratory complications, a prospective 
study on such a relation is under way. The findings 
of the current study emphasize the importance of preoperative 
testing for oxygen desaturation in children 
with OSA to identify a subpopulation of children who 
have an increased sensitivity to opioid drugs.
