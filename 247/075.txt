Objective: 
To 
determine 
whether 
unrecognized 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnoea 
(OSA) 
is 
present 
in 
some 
children 
diagnosed 
with 
normal 
variant 
short 
stature. 
Methods: 
One 
hundred 
and 
fifty-eight 
children 
aged 
less 
than 
15 
years 
and 
previously 
diagnosed 
with 
familial 
short 
stature 
or 
constitutional 
delay 
of 
growth 
were 
identified 
from 
the 
endocrine 
clinic 
database. 
A 
validated, 
standardized 
questionnaire 
designed 
to 
screen 
for 
symptoms 
of 
sleep 
disorders 
in 
children 
was 
mailed 
to 
the 
parents 
of 
eligible 
children. 
Results: 
Fifty-three 
questionnaires 
were 
returned. 
Fifteen 
of 
these 
had 
an 
abnormal 
score 
(greater 
than 
the 
mean 
+ 
three 
standard 
deviations 
in 
1157 
normal 
control 
children). 
Of 
these, 
10 
agreed 
to 
a 
sleep 
study. 
Overnight 
polysomnography 
showed 
no 
evidence 
of 
OSA 
or 
other 
sleep/breathing 
disorders. 
However, 
five 
(half) 
children 
showed 
frequent 
periodic 
leg 
movements 
of 
6.3, 
9.2, 
9.4, 
10.2 
and 
15.4 
per 
h 
(adult 
normal 
<5per 
h). 
Conclusions: 
We 
did 
not 
find 
OSA 
among 
a 
group 
of 
children 
with 
normal 
variant 
short 
stature. 
However, 
we 
found 
frequent 
periodic 
limb 
movements 
during 
sleep 
in 
a 
large 
proportion 
of 
the 
subjects, 
the 
significance 
of 
which 
remains 
to 
be 
determined. 


Key 
words: 
periodic 
limb 
movement 
disorder; 
polysomnography; 
short 
stature; 
sleep 
disorder; 
restless 
legs 
syndrome. 


Obstructive 
sleep 
apnoea 
(OSA) 
is 
associated 
with 
linear 
growth 
failure 
and 
poor 
weight 
gain. 
Furthermore, 
increased 
insulinelike 
growth 
factor-I 
(IGF-1), 
weight 
and 
height 
gain 
have 
been 
reported 
following 
adenotonsillectomy 
in 
children 
with 
OSA. 
This 
study 
was 
designed 
to 
investigate 
the 
incidence 
of 
OSA 
and 
other 
sleep 
disorders 
in 
short 
children 
diagnosed 
with 
either 
familial 
short 
stature 
or 
constitutional 
delay 
of 
growth 
and 
puberty. 
These 
two 
conditions 
are 
collectively 
known 
as 
normal 
variant 
short 
stature, 
indicating 
that 
no 
pathological 
process 
has 
contributed 
to 
the 
short 
stature 
observed. 


METHODS 


The 
study 
population 
consisted 
of 
patients 
under 
the 
age 
of 
15 
years 
diagnosed 
with 
normal 
variant 
short 
stature 
(either 
familial 
short 
stature 
or 
constitutional 
delay 
of 
growth 
and 
puberty) 
in 
the 
4-year 
period 
before 
August 
2000. 
The 
Sydney 
Children’s 
Hospital 
Endocrine 
Department’s 
computerized 
patient 
database 
was 
used 
to 
select 
subjects 
based 
on 
this 
criteria. 
Ethical 
approval 
for 
the 
study 
was 
obtained 
from 
the 
South-Eastern 
Sydney 
Area 
Health 
Service 
Ethics 
Committee 
and 
informed 
consent 
was 
obtained 
from 
all 
the 
participants. 


A 
questionnaire 
screening 
for 
symptoms 
of 
sleep 
disorders 
in 
children, 
and 
validated 
on 
1157 
normal 
children, 
was 
sent 
to 
the 
parents 
of 
each 
subject.1 
We 
considered 
a 
sleep 
score 
greater 
than 
58 
(three 
standard 
deviations 
more 
than 
the 
mean 
in 
the 
sample 
of 
1157 
normal 
children) 
to 
be 
abnormal. 
The 
questionnaire 
was 
mailed 
a 
second 
time 
to 
non-responders 
to 
maximize 
enrolment 
in 
the 
study. 


Subjects 
found 
to 
have 
an 
abnormal 
sleep 
score 
were 
contacted 
on 
telephone 
and 
offered 
a 
consultation 
with 
a 
paediatric 
sleep 
physician 
with 
a 
view 
to 
conducting 
a 
formal 
sleep 
study. 


The 
sleep 
studies 
were 
conducted 
using 
electroencephalogram 
(EEG), 
electro-oculogram 
(EOG) 
and 
chin 
and 
left 
tibialis 
anterior 
electromyogram 
(EMG). 
Respiratory 
function 
measurements 
were 
made 
using 
thoracic 
and 
abdominal 
EMGs, 
inductance 
plethysmography 
for 
chest 
and 
abdominal 
movement 
and 
oral 
and 
nasal 
airflow 
by 
nasal 
prongs 
attached 
to 
a 
pressure 
transducer 
and 
thermistors. 
Oxyhaemoglobin 
saturation 
was 
recorded 
by 
pulse 
oximetry 
on 
a 
finger 
probe 
and 
transcutaneous 
carbon 
dioxide 
measurements 
were 
also 
made. 
Standardized 
sleep, 
respiratory 
and 
periodic 
limb 
movements 
(PLM) 
scorings 
were 
recorded 
by 
a 
single 
paediatric 
sleep 
physician. 


Periodic 
limb 
movements 
in 
sleep 
(PLMS), 
formerly 
known 
as 
nocturnal 
myoclonus, 
are 
periodic, 
repetitive, 
stereotyped 
movements 
occurring 
in 
sleep. 
Detection 
of 
PLMS 
requires 
a 
sleep 
study 
combined 
with 
an 
EMG 
recording 
taken 
from 
electrodes 
placed 
over 
the 
anterior 
tibial 
muscles. 
Periodic 
limb 
movement 
disorder 
(PLMD) 
is 
a 
related 
but 
more 
severe 
condition 
with 
a 
high 
frequency 
of 
observed 
PLMS 
combined 
with 
symptoms 
such 
as 
insomnia 
and/or 
daytime 
somnolence.2 
A 
PLM 
index 
(PLMI, 
calculated 
as 
the 
total 
PLMS 
divided 
by 
total 
sleep 
time) 
exceeding 
4 
is 
accepted 
in 
adults 
as 
a 
criterion 
for 
PLMD.3,4 
No 
diagnostic 
criteria 
for 
PLMD 
in 
children 
presently 
exist. 
Periodic 
limb 
movements 
in 
sleep 
may 
or 
may 
not 
be 
associated 
with 
sleep 
arousal 
and 
the 
PLM 
arousal 
index 
(PLMAI) 
is 
used 
as 
a 
measure 
of 
this. 
The 
International 
Classification 
of 
Sleep 
Disorders 
(ICSD: 
1990, 
revised 
1997) 
proposed 
by 
the 
American 
Sleep 
Disorders 
Association 
(ASDA) 
defines 
criteria 
for 
the 
diagnosis 
of 
PLMD 
in 
adults 
where 
PLMS 
must 
satisfy 
the 
following 
criteria:5 
(i) 
a 
train 
of 
at 
least 
four 
PLMs 
occurring 
within; 
(ii) 
a 
period 
of 
4–90 
s 
with; 
(iii) 
each 
movement 
separated 
by 
at 
least 
5 
s; 
(iv) 
each 
movement 
having 
an 
EMG 
burst 
length 
between 
0.5 
and 
5 
s; 
and 
(v) 
all 
movements 
occurring 
during 
sleep. 
No 
other 
medical 
or 
psychiatric

Sleep 
disorders 
in 
children 
with 
presumed 
normal 
variant 
short 
stature 


sufficient 
to 
explain 
the 
symptoms 
may 
be 
present 
and 
no 
other 
sleep 
disorder 
known 
to 
cause 
PLM 
may 
be 
present. 


Restless 
legs 
syndrome 
(RLS) 
is 
‘a 
disorder 
characterized 
by 
disagreeable 
lower 
limb 
sensations, 
usually 
occurring 
before 
the 
onset 
of 
sleep 
and 
causing 
an 
almost 
irresistible 
urge 
to 
move 
the 
lower 
limbs’.5 
The 
diagnosis 
of 
RLS 
is 
based 
on 
symptoms 
and 
in 
this 
study 
these 
were 
asked 
at 
the 
initial 
consultation. 
Three 
diagnostic 
criteria 
have 
been 
proposed 
by 
the 
ASDA 
for 
diagnosis 
in 
adults. 
These 
are 
(i) 
an 
unpleasant 
sensation 
in 
the 
lower 
limbs 
at 
night 
or 
difficulty 
in 
initiating 
sleep; 
(ii) 
disagreeable 
sensations 
in 
the 
calves 
(e.g. 
a 
creeping 
sensation, 
aches 
or 
pains); 
and 
(iii) 
relief 
of 
lower 
limb 
discomfort 
by 
movement 
of 
the 
affected 
limbs.5 
These 
criteria 
currently 
represent 
a 
consensus 
of 
opinion 
and, 
at 
the 
time 
of 
writing, 
have 
yet 
to 
be 
validated. 


Statistical 
analyses 
were 
performed 
using 
SPPS 
software. 
Height 
and 
weight 
measurements 
were 
converted 
to 
standard 
deviation 
scores 
(SDS) 
using 
data 
from 
the 
US 
National 
Centre 
for 
Health 
Statistics.6 
Height 
and 
weight 
SDS 
were 
compared 
using 
an 
independent 
samples 
t-test. 


RESULTS 


One 
hundred 
and 
fifty-eight 
patients 
were 
eligible 
for 
inclusion 
in 
the 
study. 
Of 
these 
patients, 
53 
(33%) 
returned 
completed 
questionnaires 
(responders). 
There 
was 
no 
significant 
difference 
in 
height 
SDS, 
comparing 
responders 
and 
non-responders 
(mean 
height 
SDS 
–2.05 
vs 
–2.31; 
P 
= 
0.09; 
independent 
samples 
t-test). 
Similarly, 
there 
was 
no 
significant 
difference 
in 
weight 
SDS 
(P 
= 
0.18). 
Fifteen 
patients 
(27% 
of 
responders) 
had 
abnormal 
sleep 
scores 
(sleep 
score 
> 
58; 
abnormal 
responders). 
There 
was 
no 
significant 
difference 
in 
height 
SDS 
comparing 
those 
with 
abnormal 
and 
normal 
sleep 
scores 
(mean 
height 
SDS 
–2.32 
vs 
–2.31; 
P 
= 
0.96). 
There 
was 
also 
no 
significant 
difference 
in 
weight 
SDS 
(P 
= 
0.31). 
Ten 
of 
the 
15 
eligible 
patients 
with 
sleep 
scores 
greater 
than 
58 
had 
a 
sleep 
study 
performed 
(the 
remaining 
five 
eligible 
patients 
could 
not 
be 
recontacted). 


No 
patient 
had 
OSA; 
however, 
eight 
of 
the 
10 
patients 
(80%) 
who 
had 
sleep 
studies 
had 
PLMS 
and 
five 
of 
the 
10 
(50%; 
95% 


CI: 
19–81%) 
had 
sleep 
studies 
showing 
PLMD 
as 
defined 
by 
adult 
criteria. 
Five 
of 
the 
patients 
(50%) 
who 
had 
sleep 
studies 
were 
also 
found 
to 
have 
RLS, 
a 
diagnosis 
made 
from 
the 
history 
obtained 
at 
their 
presleep 
study 
evaluation. 
DISCUSSION 


Obstructive 
sleep 
apnoea 
has 
been 
observed 
to 
affect 
growth 
in 
children.7 
However, 
our 
study 
did 
not 
identify 
any 
evidence 
of 
OSA 
among 
short 
children. 
In 
fact, 
half 
the 
patients 
who 
had 
sleep 
studies 
(five 
out 
of 
10) 
had 
PLMD, 
a 
basal 
ganglia 
hypodopaminergic 
state 
well 
described 
in 
adults 
but 
much 
less 
so 
in 
children 
at 
the 
present 
time.2 
To 
our 
knowledge, 
this 
study 
is 
the 
first 
suggesting 
an 
association 
between 
short 
stature, 
either 
pathological 
or 
normal 
variant 
and 
PLMD. 


In 
our 
small 
study 
population, 
PLMS 
occurred 
with 
a 
frequency 
of 
at 
least 
15% 
(eight 
patients 
in 
53) 
and 
PLMD, 
as 
defined 
by 
adult 
criteria, 
occurred 
with 
a 
frequency 
of 
at 
least 
9.4% 
(five 
patients 
in 
53). 
One 
study 
has 
estimated 
the 
incidence 
in 
the 
general 
population 
of 
PLMS 
to 
be 
6%.8 
As 
this 
6% 
represents 
a 
combination 
of 
those 
subjects 
with 
PLMD 
and 
those 
with 
PLMS 
but 
not 
satisfying 
the 
ASDA 
criteria 
for 
PLMD, 
the 
incidence 
of 
actual 
PLMD 
in 
the 
general 
population 
inferred 
from 
that 
study 
would 
be 
expected 
to 
be 
even 
less 
than 
6%. 
As 
the 
incidence 
of 
PLMS 
is 
known 
to 
increase 
with 
increasing 
age,2 
it 
would 
seem 
likely 
that 
the 
incidence 
of 
PLMD 
in 


the 
general 
population 
of 
children 
less 
than 
15 
years 
of 
age 
is 
markedly 
less 
than 
the 
incidence 
of 
9.4% 
(five 
patients 
in 
53) 
found 
in 
our 
study. 
However, 
one 
recent 
study 
of 
children 
between 
5 
and 
7 
years 
of 
age 
found 
11.9% 
had 
a 
PLMI 
greater 
than 
5, 
although 
the 
incidence 
of 
PLMD, 
at 
least 
defined 
by 
adult 
criteria, 
in 
this 
population 
would 
be 
less 
than 
this 
as 
the 
adult 
definition 
requires 
the 
presence 
of 
symptoms 
such 
as 
insomnia 
and/or 
daytime 
somnolence, 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
presence 
of 
an 
increased 
PLMI.9 


Restless 
legs 
syndrome 
is 
relevant 
to 
a 
discussion 
of 
PLMD 
as 
studies 
have 
shown 
that 
most 
patients 
with 
RLS 
will 
also 
have 
PLMS.10 
Five 
patients 
(50%) 
in 
our 
study 
were 
found 
to 
have 
RLS 
and 
all 
but 
one 
patient 
in 
this 
group 
of 
five 
did 
not 
also 
have 
PLMD. 
This 
is 
consistent 
with 
other 
studies 
showing 
that 
most 
patients 
with 
RLS 
were 
observed 
to 
also 
have 
PLMD.11 
Therefore, 
a 
diagnosis 
of 
RLS 
can 
be 
used 
as 
an 
historical 
marker 
of 
likely 
PLMD 
and 
would 
be 
an 
indication 
for 
a 
sleep 
study 
if 
a 
patient 
also 
has 
symptoms 
of 
disordered 
sleep. 


A 
limitation 
of 
the 
study 
is 
the 
small 
number 
of 
patients 
studied. 
An 
additional 
limitation 
is 
the 
assumption 
that 
criteria 
for 
PLMS 
and 
PLMD 
in 
adults 
are 
valid 
in 
children 
as 
diagnostic 
criteria 
for 
children 
are 
yet 
to 
be 
determined. 
Our 
findings 
represent 
a 
stimulus 
to 
define 
criteria 
for 
the 
diagnosis 
of 
PLMD 
in 
children. 


The 
explanation 
for 
an 
association 
between 
short 
stature 
and 
PLMD 
must, 
at 
the 
moment, 
be 
purely 
speculative. 
It 
is 
interesting 
to 
note 
that 
both 
normal 
variant 
short 
stature 
and 
PLMD, 
especially 
in 
children, 
have 
a 
strong 
familial 
predisposition.2 
It 
is 
presently 
unknown 
how 
a 
genetic 
predisposition 
to 
the 
two 
conditions 
is 
made 
manifest. 


An 
endocrine 
abnormality 
directly 
resulting 
from 
the 
disordered 
sleep 
caused 
by 
PLMD, 
or 
resulting 
from 
a 
more 
fundamental 
abnormality 
independently 
causing 
both 
PLMD 
and 
abnormal 
growth, 
certainly 
offers 
an 
enticing 
possibility 
when 
considering 
a 
reason 
for 
the 
variation 
in 
growth 
and 
development 
in 
children 
with 
both 
PLMD 
and 
normal 
variant 
short 
stature. 
Growth 
hormone 
(GH) 
secretion 
is 
known 
to 
increase 
during 
slow-wave 
sleep, 
with 
maximal 
nocturnal 
secretion 
occurring 
in 
deep 
sleep 
(stage 
4) 
and 
its 
secretion 
is 
inhibited 
during 
rapid 
eye 
movement 
(REM) 
sleep. 
Growth 
hormone 
secretion 
is 
also 
stimulated 
by 
dopamine 
agonists. 
There 
is 
evidence 
for 
disordered 
central 
nervous 
system 
dopaminergic 
neurotransmission 
in 
patients 
with 
RLS 
and 
PLMD.2 
Dopamine 
agonists 
are 
effective 
treatment 
for 
RLS 
and 
PLMD 
in 
adults 
and 
their 
cessation 
results 
in 
a 
rebound 
effect 
with 
worsening 
of 
symptoms. 
However, 
a 
role 
for 
GH 
secretion 
seems 
unlikely 
for 
a 
number 
of 
reasons. 
No 
specific 
abnormality 
of 
GH 
secretion 
has 
been 
shown 
in 
patients 
with 
normal 
variant 
short 
stature 
and 
GH 
supplementation 
does 
not 
alter 
adult 
height 
in 
these 
patients. 
Also, 
GH 
is 
not 
the 
primary 
mediator 
of 
pubertal 
development, 
which 
is 
also 
delayed 
in 
the 
subset 
of 
children 
with 
constitutional 
delay 
of 
growth 
and 
puberty. 
The 
absence 
of 
auxologically 
defined 
growth 
failure 
in 
children 
with 
normal 
variant 
short 
stature 
is 
also 
inconsistent 
with 
an 
abnormality 
of 
GH 
secretion. 
It 
seems 
unlikely, 
therefore, 
that 
abnormal 
GH 
secretion 
is 
implicated 
in 
the 
pathogenesis 
of 
the 
short 
stature 
seen 
in 
children 
with 
PLMD. 


Periodic 
limb 
movement 
disorder 
may 
therefore 
represent 
a 
pathological 
but 
treatable 
cause 
of, 
or 
contributor 
to, 
short 
stature 
in 
a 
subgroup 
of 
children 
formerly 
thought 
to 
be 
short 
because 
of 
purely 
familial 
factors 
and 
therefore 
untreatable. 
Should 
this 
be 
found 
to 
be 
true, 
the 
evaluation 
of 
short 
stature 
in 
children 
should 
then 
include 
a 
history 
regarding 
symptoms 
of 
sleep 
disorders, 
with 
sleep 
studies 
being 
offered 
to 
those 
patients 
with 
a 
positive 
history 
of 
a 
sleep 
disorder. 
If 
it 
is 
found 
that 
PLMD 
does 
not 
contribute 
to 
short 
stature 
in 
children 
but 
represents 
merely 
an 



360 


associated 
disorder, 
its 
occurrence 
with 
greater 
frequency 
in 
this 
population 
would 
also 
need 
to 
be 
questioned 
while 
evaluating 
children 
with 
short 
stature. 


Restless 
legs 
syndrome 
and 
PLMD 
in 
adults 
have 
both 
been 
treated 
with 
opioid, 
benzodiazepine, 
anticonvulsant 
and 
dopaminergic 
drugs, 
the 
last 
being 
currently 
regarded 
as 
the 
drug 
treatment 
of 
choice.12 
A 
recent 
American 
Academy 
of 
Sleep 
Medicine 
Report 
described 
clonazepam, 
among 
other 
drugs 
studied, 
as 
being 
effective 
in 
the 
treatment 
of 
adult 
PLMD 
and 
possibly 
RLS. 
However, 
the 
report 
also 
stated 
that 
no 
specific 
recommendations 
can 
as 
yet 
be 
made 
regarding 
treatment 
of 
PLMD 
and/or 
RLS 
in 
children.13 
Among 
the 
classes 
of 
drugs 
being 
used 
in 
adults, 
benzodiazepines 
are 
among 
those 
causing 
the 
least 
significant 
side-effects. 
At 
Sydney 
Children’s 
Hospital, 
clonazepam, 
a 
benzodiazepine-class 
drug 
used 
in 
childhood 
as 
an 
anticonvulsant, 
has 
been 
used 
in 
the 
treatment 
of 
childhood 
PLMD 
and/or 
RLS. 
Although, 
at 
least 
anecdotally, 
it 
does 
appear 
to 
alleviate 
symptoms, 
its 
efficacy 
in 
childhood 
PLMD 
and 
RLS 
has 
not, 
at 
least 
to 
our 
knowledge, 
been 
extensively 
studied. 
However, 
its 
use 
in 
adults 
has 
shown 
to 
improve 
sleep 
quality 
and 
sleep 
studies 
have 
shown 
improvements 
in 
some 
sleep 
parameters 
unexplained 
by 
the 
known 
sedative 
effects 
of 
clonazepam.12 
These 
improvements, 
beyond 
that 
offered 
by 
sedation 
alone, 
which 
with 
prolonged 
use 
would 
be 
expected 
to 
wane, 
suggest 
that 
treatment 
of 
RLS 
and 
PLMD 
in 
children 
may 
be 
justified, 
although 
further 
studies 
are 
needed 
to 
confirm 
this. 


In 
conclusion, 
we 
did 
not 
find 
OSA 
among 
children 
with 
normal 
variant 
short 
stature. 
However, 
we 
found 
that 
the 
related 
conditions, 
RLS 
and 
PLMD, 
occur 
with 
greater 
frequency 
than 
expected. 
The 
significance 
of 
this 
observation 
is 
as 
yet 
uncertain. 
Further 
studies 
are 
required 
to 
determine 
child-specific 
diagnostic 
criteria 
for 
PLMD 
followed 
by 
the 
study 
of 
a 
larger 
population 
of 
children 
with 
normal 
variant 
short 
stature.
