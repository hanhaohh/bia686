Study Objectives: To examine the prevalence and distribution of the 
symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in a community-based 
sample of adolescents, and to assess association of SDB with body mass 
index, daytime sleepiness, school performance, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder. 
Design: Epidemiologic study of a community-based sample of adolescents 
and 1 parent with whom separate structured face to face diagnostic 
interviews were conducted. 
Setting: Metropolitan Detroit, Michigan, USA. 
Participants: One thousand fourteen adolescents aged 13 to 16 years 
and a paired parent. 
Measures and Results: SDB was defined as report of loud snoring, 
gasping/choking or snorting, awakening with gasping or choking, or momentary 
periods of stopped or abnormal breathing occurring weekly. More 
than 20% of the adolescents snored at least a few nights per month, 6% 
snoring every or nearly every night. Apnea-like symptoms affected from 

2.5% to 6.1% of adolescents. The prevalence of weekly SDB was 6.0% 
according to both adolescent and parental report and was twice as likely 
among African Americans as Caucasians. The association of body mass 
index with SDB was twice as great among Caucasian adolescents as 
African American adolescents. SDB was independently associated with 
excessive daytime sleepiness, poorer grade point averages, and attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder–inattention type; each being more than 
twice as likely to occur among those with SDB than those without SDB. 
Conclusions: Symptoms of SDB appear to be common among adolescents 
and independently associated with short- and longer-term adverse 
outcomes. These associations appear to be complex in the population 
and will require longitudinal epidemiologic studies to clarify the nature of 
their relationships and the opportunities for intervention.

higher externalizing behavior problems in patients who snore or

studies have found that tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy procedures

To our knowledge, there have been no epidemiologic studies 
of the prevalence of SDB symptoms, risk factors, and potential 
consequences in a large community-based sample of adolescents 
in the United States. In this study, we examined the prevalence 
and distribution of SDB symptoms, some of their risk factors, and 
their association with potential consequences among a sample of 
1014 adolescent–parent pairs. Specifically we (1) examined the 
prevalence and distribution of SDB symptoms and a syndrome of 
SDB according to both parental and youth report, (2) assessed the 
level of agreement between youth and parent reports, (3) tested 
the association of SDB with suspected risk factors (e.g., BMI) and

on-one in-home interviews were conducted in as private a setting 
as possible without the presence of other family members or any 
other people. Prior to the interview, written informed consent and 
assent were obtained from the adolescents’ parent or guardian and 
the adolescent participant, respectively. The study was approved 
by the Institutional Review Board at Henry Ford Health System. 
On-going analyses were approved by the Institutional Review 
Board at RTI International. Interviews took place between February 
of 2001 and May of 2003.

Lifetime prevalence estimates for all measures are presented 
based on the youth and parent reports, except GPA, for which 
only parental report was available. Level of agreement between 
youth and parents on SDB and ADHD was assessed by . statistic. 


Treating BMI as a continuous variable in logistic-regression 
models assumes that BMI is linearly associated with SDB. We 
tested this assumption using the fractional polynomial method.
34,35 In this analytic method, successive combinations of the 
degree and power of polynomials are fit to the data. The best-fitting 
degree and power of polynomial, including a linear function, 
is determined by partial likelihood ratio tests for significantly 
increased model fit for each increasing degree of polynomial. 
Separate models were estimated for youth and parent report of 
SDB and these continuous outcomes, although generalized estimating 
equations (GEE, reviewed below) were used to combine 
estimates across multiple observers or reports, this method cannot 
account for the potential nonlinearity of these relationships. Thus, 
the linearity of the association between BMI and SDB was tested

a few times per month to 2.5% for parent report of youth awaking 
with gasping or choking or momentary cessation of breathing. 

Approximately 6% of adolescents had at least weekly loud 
snoring and/or apnea-like symptoms according to both youth 
and parent reports separately. These youth were thus classified 
as probable cases of SDB. The level of agreement between youth 
and parent report of SDB was moderate (. = 0.46). Among demographic 
characteristics, SDB was significantly associated only 
with being African American, showing an over 2-fold increased 
risk of SDB relative to Caucasian youth (see Table 3). 

BMI and SDB 

A key risk factor for SDB and OSA in adults is a high BMI. 
The median BMI in this study was 21.5, as reported by both youth 
and parent. The association between SDB and BMI was examined 
using GEE to combine youth and parent reports but allowing for 
testing of significant differences by source of the report. It was 
found that, on average, for every 1-unit increase in BMI. there 
was a 12% increased risk of SDB, after adjusting for adolescent 
age, sex, family income, and race or ethnicity (odds ratio [OR]=

SDB refers to sleep-disordered breathing; OR, odds ratio; CI, confidence 
interval 

1.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08-1.16). There was no significant 
difference by youth versus parent report (p = .55). 

Treating BMI as a continuous variable in these analyses was 
supported by finding that no polynomial higher than the linear 
model fit these data better for either youth or parent reports, as 
tested by fractional polynomial analysis (p > .59 and p > .32, 
respectively). A linear model of this relationship suggests that 
there is no point at which the degree of association between BMI 
and SDB is substantially greater than at any other point across 
the distribution of BMI. However, for illustrative purposes, those 
adolescents with a BMI above the sample median (median = 21.5, 
interquartile range 19.4-24.5) were more than twice as likely to 
have SDB as were those below the median (OR = 2.57, 95% CI 
1.6-4.08), using GEE analyses that adjusted for age, sex, family 
income, and race or ethnicity. 

In each of these analyses of the association of BMI with SDB, 
African American youth had an increased risk of SDB independent 
of BMI, relative to Caucasian adolescents (continuous 
analysis: OR = 2.29, 95% CI 1.38-3.81; median split analysis: 
OR = 2.63, 95% CI 1.61-4.29). Being African American was the 
only demographic factor associated with SDB throughout these 
analyses. However, a statistically significant interaction between 
BMI and race or ethnicity was also found in the GEE analyses 
(p = .06, which is below the criteria for logit regression, p < .10, 
recommend by Hosmer & Lemeshow).35 Specifically, the linear 
association between BMI and SDB was significantly greater for 
Caucasian than for African American adolescents (OR = 1.17, 
95% CI 1.11-1.23; OR = 1.09, 95% CI 1.04-1.13, respectively). 
These differences translate into a nearly 4-fold increased risk of 
SDB for Caucasian adolescents above the sample median BMI 
of 21.5, compared with those below it (OR = 3.92, 95% CI 1.616.05), 
whereas among African American adolescents, there was 
less than a 2-fold increased risk (OR = 1.82, 95% CI 0.98-3.40).

at least a few nights per month and approximately 6% snoring 
every or nearly every night. Apnea-like symptoms, such as gasping, 
choking, snorting, being awakened by these occurrences, or 
appearing to stop breathing, were also relatively common, with 
occurrences reported at least a few times per month ranging from 
2.5% to 6.1% of adolescents. Both youth and parents reported 
a prevalence of 6% of probable SDB. African Americans were 
found to have a 2- to 3-fold increased risk of SDB, relative to 
Caucasian adolescents. There was a significant interaction between 
BMI and being African American, compared with being 
Caucasian: BMI having nearly twice the association with SDB 
among Caucasian, compared with African American, adolescents. 
SDB was also significantly associated with a number of daytime 
factors. Those adolescents with SDB were 2 and 3 times more 
likely to have excessive daytime sleepiness, were twice as likely 
to have fallen asleep during a morning class at school in the past 
2 weeks, and were more likely to have a lower GPA than those 
adolescents without SDB, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, 
and family income. Additionally, SDB was associated with an approximately 
2.5-times increased risk of Inattention type of ADHD 
than were those without SDB symptoms but not the Hyperactivity 
subtype of ADHD, independent of other behavior problems 
and potential demographic confounders. In a final model of SDB 
and daytime factors, current excessive daytime sleepiness, GPA 
and ADHD–inattention subtype were independently associated 
with SDB adjusting for sex, age, race/ethnicity, conduct disorder, 
and oppositional defiant disorder. These independent associations 
with both short-and longer-term potential consequences suggest 
the possibility of complex development of multiple adverse conditions 
associated with SDB in adolescents. 

Prevalence of Symptoms of SDB 

The results of this study build upon and extend the increasing 
body of work on SDB and OSA among children. The prevalence 
of snoring symptoms reported by other studies are comparable 
with those reported here: 4% of a Greek and 7% of Turkish children 
were reported to be habitual snorers6,9 (6% of this study’s 
adolescents snored every or nearly every day); in samples from 
Germany and Spain, approximately 28% of adolescents were reported 
to snore at least sometimes7,8 (20% of this study’s adolescents 
snored at least of few times per month). This study extended 
beyond these studies by also assessing other known symptoms 
associated with SDB (e.g., awakening with gasping or choking), 
indicating that approximately 6% of adolescents aged 13 to 16 
years may experience some of these symptoms at least weekly, 
according to independent reports of both youth and parents. This 
estimated prevalence of SDB is a somewhat higher than recent 
SDB estimates from population-based studies of children using 
traditional polysomnography clinical thresholds (approximately 
2%)52 and about the same as those found among adults in Western 
countries (5%),3 suggesting that this self-report measure, while 
lacking the validity of polysomnography, is not an unrealistic one 
for adolescents. 

BMI, Race/Ethnicity, and SDB 

Differences in the rates of SDB and OSA in children by race or 
ethnicity have been mixed.3 Redline et al10 reported an increased 
prevalence of SDB among African American children, compared 

with Caucasian children among a high-risk sample derived from 
a genetic epidemiology study, even after adjusting for obesity. 
However, among adults in a retrospective chart review study, 
Scharf et al19 found no difference by race or ethnicity in the respiratory 
disturbance index once BMI and median income were 
statistically controlled. In this study, however, African American 
adolescents were more than 2 times more likely than Caucasian 
adolescents to have SDB, even after adjusting for family income, 
sex, age, and BMI. Indeed, this main effect for African Americans 
remained even with finding a significant interaction between 
BMI and race/ethnicity. 

SDB and Daytime Factors 

It has been observed that young children with OSA do not 
routinely present with excessive daytime sleepiness, but, rather, 
they may also present with externalizing behaviors such as hyperactivity 
24 however some researchers have found an association 
with daytime sleepiness.12,13,15 It has also been reported in the 
few school-based cohort studies that OSA and SDB are associated 
with poor school performance.20-22 In this study, SDB was 
moderately associated with excessive daytime sleepiness, falling 
asleep during class, and poorer overall GPA, after adjusting for 
age, sex, race/ethnicity, family income, ADHD, conduct disorder, 
and oppositional defiant disorder. This latter finding suggests an 
effect of SDB on school performance beyond its association with 
demographic factors or behavior problems more generally. 

Although a number of studies have identified an association 
between SDB or OSA and behavior problems in children, including 
inattention and hyperactivity, the majority of these studies 
have been based on clinic-derived samples. The few population-
based pediatric studies have focused on younger children, finding 
significant associations between symptoms of SDB and both hyperactivity 
and inattention.12 The 1 general-pediatric-clinic study 
included children 2 to 14 years of age and found a stronger association 
of symptoms of SDB and hyperactivity in children less 
than 8 years of age, with weak or nonsignificant associations in 
children 8 years of age or older.27 In contrast, this study found that 
adolescents with weekly symptoms of SDB were approximately 

2.5 times more likely to meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria for Inattention type of 
ADHD than those without SDB symptoms but found no association 
between SDB symptoms and Hyperactivity type of ADHD. 
Although studies of young children have found symptoms of SDB 
to be associated with both hyperactivity and inattention, among 
adults, symptoms of SDB have been consistently associated with 
symptoms of inattention-sleepiness rather than hyperactivity.3941 
Placing this study in the context of these studies, adolescence 
may be a period of a transition in the symptomatology of ADHD 
that changes the association between SDB and ADHD subtypes. 
Such a change in association would parallel observed changes in 
ADHD presentation in adulthood (more inattention) versus childhood 
(more hyperactivity).42-44 
Finally, we estimated a single model that included excessive 
daytime sleepiness, parent-reported GPA, and ADHD–inattention 
subtype, adjusting for demographic characteristics, conduct disorder, 
and oppositional defiant disorder. SDB was independently 
associated with a greater than 2-fold increased risk of each of 
these potential daytime consequences. Thus, SDB may have both 
near-term consequences (i.e., excessive daytime sleepiness in the

sequences (e.g., ADHD symptoms). Recently, Beebe and Gozal independent longer-term effects on outcomes such as GPA and 
developed a theoretical model of this link between OSA or SDB ADHD–inattention subtype. Thus, there appears to be increasing
