ABSTRACT 

Studies of snoring and sleep disturbance in the United States have been 
predominately in clinic-based settings of children suspected to have obstructive 
sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome. Therefore, the purposes of this study were to 
utilize an orthodontic setting in which healthy children were seen regularly to 
study the prevalence of snoring and sleep disturbance among 405 children aged 
6 to 17 years of age and to identify specific sleep behavior patterns associated with 
the increased odds of snoring. A sleep behavior questionnaire was administered to 
the child’s parent or guardian. The questionnaire responses were analyzed using 

2 analysis, and factor analysis was used to extract meaningful domains. The selected 
domains were used later in a logistic model to calculate the odds of snoring. 
The results indicated that 17% of the children habitually snored. The odds of 
snoring were approximately three times greater among mouth breathers and children 
who slept with their head tipped back and 1.5 times greater among those 
with morning headaches and frequent coughs and colds. In conclusion, snorers 
have significantly more sleep behavior problems than do nonsnorers.

ing7,15,17 and restless sleep9,16,17 also have been consistently 
reported among children with OSAHS. 

Community-based studies of snoring have 
been conducted in the United Kingdom,11 Italy,2 
and Portugal.14 In the United States, children suspected 
of having OSAHS have been studied.7,8,15 
The orthodontic population provides a feasible 
way to study snoring in predominantly healthy 
children with dental malocclusions. The objectives 
of the present study were (1) to determine the 
prevalence of sleep behavior problems between 
snoring and nonsnoring children, (2) to assess the 
dose–response relationship between snoring and 
sleep behavior problems, and (3) to identify the sleep 
behavior domains that increases the odds of snoring. 

METHOD 

Study Sample 

The study sample was recruited from a population 
seeking or undergoing orthodontic treatment at 
the School of Dentistry and from several private 
practices in Cleveland, Ohio. Children were excluded 
from the study if they had documented 
craniofacial anomalies such as cleft lip or palate or 
any other serious medical problems. Subjects were 
recruited between 1996 and 1998. The study was 
approved by the Institutional Review Board of 
Case Western Reserve University. 

Data Collection 

DEMOGRAPHIC DATA 

The subject’s age, gender, and ethnicity were documented 
from the dental records. The height and 
weight information was obtained from the parents 
or guardians and was recorded for each subject in 
inches and pounds. The body mass index (BMI) 

was calculated for each subject [weight in kilo-
grams/height (m2)]. 

QUESTIONNAIRE 

The parents or guardians were asked to sign a consent 
form and then complete a demographic and 
sleep behavior questionnaire on behalf of their 
children. The sleep behavior questionnaire was 
adapted from a previous study11 and was administered 
over the 2-year period of the study. The questionnaire 
consisted of 11 Likert-type scale (never, 
rarely, sometimes, often) and seven “yes” or “no” 
questions. It has been validated and shown to be 
reliable in assessing the sleep problems of children. 
The questionnaire covered a wide range of sleep 
behaviors, including sleep problems, restless sleep, 
getting to or staying asleep, daytime sleepiness, 
daytime behavior such as hyperactivity and paying 
attention in class, related medical problems such as 
coughs and colds, morning headaches, hearing 
problems, enlarged tonsils or adenoids, medication 
use, mouth breathing, head tipped back during 
sleep, and the intensity and frequency of snoring. 

Data Analysis 

The analysis for the first objective proceeded with 
collapsing the snoring categories into two groups, 
nonsnorers (never and rarely) and snorers (sometimes 
and often), consistent with previous studies.
5,18 The prevalence of sleep behavior problems 
between the nonsnorers and snorers was computed 
using the 2 test. 

The analysis for the second objective proceeded 
with collapsing the Likert scale sleep behavior 
problems into two categories: no (never and 
rarely) and yes (sometimes and often). The dose– 
response relationship between the four snoring categories 
and the sleep behavior problems were analyzed 
using the 2 test. Because of the multiple 
testing problem, Bonferroni’s correction [ of 


SNORING AND SLEEP DISTURBANCE AMONG CHILDREN/NELSON, KULNIS 65 NELSON, KULNIS 65 

0.05 divided by the total number of questions analyzed 
(0.05/15 = 0.003)] was used, and a p value 
<0.003 was used to determine statistical significance 
for the 2 tests. Statistical analysis also included 
t test for continuous variables such as age 
and BMI. 
The analysis for the third objective used factor 
analysis to reduce the number of questions in 
the questionnaire into meaningful domains that 
would be useful for further logistic regression 
analysis. For factor analysis, we excluded the question 
about current medication use because of its 
poor correlation with the other questions. The 
computation for factor analysis used the principal 
components and maximum likelihood methods 
with promax rotation. The robustness of the 
model to explain the data is expressed as the percentage 
of the total variance explained. Only factors 
with eigenvalues greater than 1 were retained. 
Individual questions with a loading weight greater 
than 0.65 were assigned to a particular factor and 
if the question did not load significantly on any 
other factor. Factor scores then were obtained by 
multiplying the standardized values by the corresponding 
factor score coefficients for each subject. 
The logistic regression model was computed to 
obtain estimates of odds for snoring using the following 
independent variables: age, BMI, and the 
factor scores. Both forced-entry and stepwise 
methods were used for the regression model. Significance 
was assessed at p < 0.05 for the logistic 
model. 

RESULTS 

A total of 405 parents and guardians completed the 
sleep behavior questionnaire. The study sample 
comprised 92% white, 54% female (mean age, 11.9 ± 

2.5 years; range, 6–17 years). About 50% of the children 
were undergoing orthodontic treatment, and 
50% were seeking pretreatment orthodontic evaluation 
at the time of the administration of the questionnaire. 
Only 390 (96.3%) parents and guardians 
responded to the frequency of snoring question because 
some were unsure about their child’s snoring 
status. From the 390 responses, about 17% of the 
children snored often, 21% sometimes, 21% rarely, 
and 41% never snored. The snorers (often and 
sometimes) and nonsnorers (never and rarely) included 
147 and 243 children, respectively. 

The mean age between snorers (11.6 ± 2.5 
years) and nonsnorers (11.9 ± 2.5 years) did not 
differ significantly. The mean BMI was significantly 
(p = 0.048) greater in snorers (19.8 ± 4.3) 
than in nonsnorers (18.9 ± 3.2). Both snorers 
(48%) and nonsnorers (51%) had similar proportions 
undergoing orthodontic treatment. 

Snorers had significantly (Table 1) more frequent 
problems related to sleep, restless sleep, 
coughs and colds, sleeping with head tipped back, 
mouth breathing, morning headaches, and tonsils 
or adenoids removed than nonsnorers. As the categories 
of snoring increased from never to often, the 
percentage who reported problems with restless 
sleep, frequent coughs and colds, sleeping with the 
head tipped back, mouth breathing, enlarged adenoids, 
and frequent morning headaches also increased 
significantly (Table 2), suggesting a dose– 
response relationship between snoring and sleep 
behavior problems. 

Factor analysis was computed for 266 children 
because there was missing or uncertain information 
for some questions; therefore, the analysis 
excluded these cases. Factor analysis extracted five 
factors that explained 62% of the variance in the 
questionnaire. The individual questions that loaded 
onto the five factors (Table 3) were tonsil and adenoid 
history, explaining the most variance, followed 
by bedtime sleep behavior, daytime behavior, 
health problems related to sleep disturbance, and 
head or breathing positions during sleep. Additionally, 
we had to eliminate questions: problems 
related to sleeping, daytime sleepiness, and hearing 
problems because they did not load according to

were 1.5 times greater among snorers. The logistic 
model with age, BMI, and the five factor scores 
was able to classify correctly 88% of the nonsnorers 
and 52% of the snorers. 

DISCUSSION 

The children selected for this study were between 
6 to 17 years of age; this is the age range of most 
children in the orthodontic setting. The prevalence 

of habitual snoring in this group of children was 
17%, which is slightly higher than the previously reported 
studies2,5,11–14 of snoring in children younger 
than 14 years of age. The questionnaire in our study 
was requested to be completed by all parents and 
guardians who brought their children for either follow-
up appointments or pretreatment evaluation at 
the orthodontic clinic or office. It is likely that parents 
and guardians who perceive their child to have 
a sleep-related problem would be motivated to 
complete the questionnaire. About 50% of our sample 
were undergoing orthodontic treatment at the 
time of this study, whereas 50% were undergoing 
pretreatment evaluation. We checked the data to 
determine whether the snoring prevalence differed 
between these two groups of children and found 
that the frequencies did not differ significantly.

The mean BMI was significantly greater 
among snorers compared with nonsnorers. This 
finding is in accordance with our previous study,13 
in contrast to findings from other reported studies 
of snoring and apneic children17,19 that found these 
children to be underweight and underdeveloped. 
The height and weight recorded in this study were 
supplied by parents, and we did not measure the 
children directly. It is likely that this finding was 
influenced by imprecise recall of this information. 

The most significant differences between 
snoring and nonsnoring children in the present 
study were problems related to sleep, restless sleep, 
coughs and colds, sleeping with the head tipped 
back, mouth breathing, morning headaches, and 
tonsils or adenoids removed. Our results support 
previous research2,5,11 that also reported similar 
sleep behavior and health problems among snoring 
children. These sleep behavior symptoms, except 
for mouth breathing, do not differ significantly between 
children who primarily snore and those with 
OSAHS.15 Thus, primary snoring and OSAHS are 
thought to lie on a continuum, with a distinction 
between the two being a matter of degree of upper 
airway obstruction than qualitative differences in 
symptoms.15 

Factor analysis provided a way of testing the 
robustness of the questionnaire by reducing the individual 
questions into meaningful domains or 
constructs that were not correlated with each other. 
The five domains explained 62% of the variance in 
the sleep behavior questionnaire. Tonsil and adenoid 
history and bedtime sleep behavior domains 
explained the most variance in the questionnaire, 
probably indicating its high frequency in a population 
of both snorers and nonsnorers. The internal 
consistency within the five domains ranged from 
moderate to excellent, indicating that, for the head 
and breathing position and related health problem 
domains, the questions did not completely assess 
similar constructs. Despite its moderate consistency, 
in the logistic model, these two factors significantly 
explained the odds of snoring. The questions 
that comprise these two factors, that is, 

(1) mouth breathing and sleeping with head tipped 
back and (2) frequent morning headaches and 
coughs and colds, also demonstrated a dose– 
response relationship with snoring categories, further 
strengthening the validity of these questions. 
Mouth breathing has been shown in previous studies 
to be significantly greater in snorers and 
OSAHS children.5,7,9,15 Our results are also consistent 
with previous research2 that found respiratory 
symptoms such as cough and colds to be associated 
with increased snoring. We also found frequent 
morning headaches to be significantly different between 
snorers and nonsnorers, in contrast to other 
reported studies of snoring and OSAHS children.
5,15 We speculate that this finding could have 
been influenced by children with coughs and cold 
who may have had more frequent morning headaches 
because of the significant correlation between 
the two questions. Although we found restless 
sleep to differ significantly between snorers 
and nonsnorers in univariate analysis, consistent 
with previous studies,5,9,11,16 it did not significantly 
increase the odds of snoring in our multivariate 
analysis. It could be that controlling for the effects 
of other symptoms decreases the predictability of 
restless sleep. 
Most often, if a child does not snore, it is unlikely 
this child has OSAHS; if the child snores, it 
is likely that the child could have either OSAHS,15 
adenotonsillar hypertrophy,4,9,19–21 or upper respiratory 
problems.2 Our classification results from 
the logistic model further supports this speculation, 
indicating that 88% of nonsnorers can be classified 
correctly by using the sleep behavior questionnaire, 
whereas only 52% of the snorers could be 
correctly classified. It is difficult, therefore, to classify 
correctly snorers using sleep behavior symptoms 
but rather must be further evaluated for upper 
upper airway obstruction; ear, nose, and throat; and 
respiratory problems. 

The limitations of the present study include 
the following: (1) We did not evaluate the children 
with polysomnography to determine the degree of 
sleep disturbance; some of the snoring children in 


70 SLEEP AND BREATHING/VOLUME 5, NUMBER 2 2001 

our group may have had OSAHS. (2) We could 
have misclassified snorers and nonsnorers based on 
parental reports, especially those who snored 
mildly or sometimes. A previous study15 reported 
that parental perceptions of snoring could over-
report symptoms because they found that some 
children snored only mildly when evaluated with 
polysomnography. (3) Generalization of the results 
to a larger population is limited because it is more 
prevalent for middle and higher socioeconomic 
groups to seek and undergo orthodontic treatment 
than lower income groups. 

In summary, there are sleep behavior differences 
between snoring and nonsnoring children. 
The sleep questionnaire is more useful, however, 
for classifying nonsnorers than for snorers. Habitual 
snorers with mouth breathing must be further 
evaluated for OSAHS, adenotonsillar hypertrophy, 
and respiratory problems.
