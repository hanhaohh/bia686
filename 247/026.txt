Tonsillectomy; 
Oximetry 
Objective: 
To 
evaluate 
the 
effect 
of 
adenotonsillectomy 
on 
the 
oxygen 
saturation 
measures 
by 
nocturnal 
pulse 
oximetry 
in 
children 
with 
sleep 
breathing 
disorders 
(SBD). 
Methods: 
A 
non-controlled 
clinical 
trial 
was 
performed. 
Thirty-one 
children 
with 
suspected 
SBD 
and 
a 
clinical 
indication 
for 
adenotonsillectomy 
were 
recruited. 
All 
of 
them 
underwent 
overnight 
oxygen 
saturation 
monitoring 
before 
and 
after 
surgery. 
Results: 
Twenty-seven 
patients 
completed 
the 
study. 
The 
mean 
age 
was 
5.2 
. 
1.8 
years. 
Eighteen 
(66.7%) 
were 
male. 
The 
most 
prevalent 
symptoms 
were: 
snoring 
(100%), 
respiratory 
pauses 
(96.8%), 
nocturnal 
mouth 
breathing 
(96.8%), 
restless 
sleep 
(80%) 
and 
drooling 
(74.1%). 
Twenty-three 
children 
(85.2%) 
presented 
grade 
3 
or 
4 
tonsillar 
hyperplasia. 
There 
was 
a 
significant 
improvement 
in 
the 
postoperative 
oxygen 
desaturation 
index 
(ODI) 
(0.65; 
0.5—1.3) 
compared 
with 
the 
preoperative 
index 
(1.63; 
1.1—2.4) 
( 
p 
< 
0.001). 
Conclusion: 
Adenotonsillectomy 
improved 
the 
oxygen 
saturation 
measures 
by 
nocturnal 
pulse 
oximetry 
in 
children 
with 
sleep 
breathing 
disorders.

J.

et

breathing 
disorders 
(SBD) 
involved 
a 
range 
of 
different 
degrees 
of 
obstruction 
during 
sleep, 
varying 
from 
primary 
snoring 
(PS) 
to 
partial 
or 
complete 
obstruction 
of 
the 
upper 
airways, 
known 
as 
obstructive 
sleep 
apneas 
and 
hypopneas 
syndrome 
(OSAHS). 
OSAHS 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
prevalent 
sleep 
breathing 
disorders 
in 
the 
general 
population, 
affecting 
both 
adults 
and 
children. 
However, 
the 
presentation 
of 
OSAHS 
among 
children 
appears 
to 
be 
different 
from 
that 
seen 
in 
adults 
from 
several 
standpoints, 
especially 
aspects 
related 
to 
congenital, 
neurological 
and 
anatomical 
changes 
[2]. 


SBD 
appear 
to 
have 
a 
major 
effect 
on 
quality 
of 
life 
in 
the 
affected 
children. 
Franco 
et 
al. 
evaluated 
61 
children 
with 
OSAHS 
diagnosed 
by 
polysomnography 
(PSG) 
using 
a 
standardized 
questionnaire 
on 
quality 
of 
life 
entitled 
OSA-18. 
Based 
on 
this 
questionnaire, 
OSAHS 
had 
a 
small 
impact 
on 
20 
children 
(33%), 
moderate 
on 
19 
(31%) 
and 
strong 
on 
22 
(36%). 
There 
was 
a 
significant 
correlation 
between 
the 
OSA-18 
scores 
and 
the 
apnea 
and 
hypopnea 
indices 
(AHI), 
even 
when 
adjusted 
for 
confounding 
factors 
in 
a 
multiple 
linear 
regression 
model 
(r 
= 
0.5, 
p 
= 
0.007) 
[3]. 
In 
2003, 
Sohn 
and 
Rosenfeld 
evaluated 
the 
impact 
of 
adenotonsillectomy, 
using 
the 
same 
questionnaire 
on 
a 
cohort 
of 
54 
children. 
The 
size 
of 
the 
effect 
(mean 
of 
standardized 
answer) 
in 
the 
scores 
(before 
and 
after 
surgery) 
was 
1.54, 
at 
95% 
confidence 
intervals 
between 
1.26 
and 
1.82 
(an 
effect 
greater 
than 
or 
equal 
to 
0.8 
was 
considered 
large) 
[4]. 


Adenotonsilectomy 
is 
considered 
the 
best 
treatment 
to 
OSAHS. 
This 
assumption 
is 
based 
meanly 
in 
the 
clinical 
observation 
of 
the 
benefic 
post-surgical 
effects 
in 
symptomatology. 
Only 
under 
exceptional 
circumstances 
(as 
in 
the 
case 
of 
syndromic 
and 
cerebral 
palsy 
patients) 
polyssomnography 
(the 
gold 
standard 
method 
to 
diagnose 
and 
to 
evaluate 
changes 
by 
the 
treatment 
in 
the 
affected 
children) 
is 
performed 
in 
our 
State. 
Pulse 
oxymetry, 
in 
the 
other 
hand, 
is 
cheaper 
and 
disposable 
in 
every 
hospital. 
Thus, 
we 
decided 
to 
evaluate 
the 
effect 
of 
adenotonsillectomy 
on 
oxygen 
saturation 
during 
sleep 
in 
children 
with 
SBD. 


2. 
Methods 
In 
order 
to 
evaluate 
the 
effect 
of 
adenotonsillectomy 
on 
children 
with 
SBD, 
it 
was 
planned 
to 
perform 
a 
before 
and 
after 
non-controlled 
clinical 
trial. 
The 
cases 
were 
selected 
among 
children 
seen 
at 
the 
pediatric 
otorhinolaryngology 
and 
pulmonology 
outpatient 
clinic 
at 
Hospital 
Santo 
Antoˆnio 
do 
Complexo 
Hospitalar 
Santa 
Casa 
de 
Porto 
Alegre. 
All 
the 
patients 
selected 
presented 
an 
indication 
for 
tonsillectomy 
with 
or 
without 
adenoidectomy 
(Table 
1),

and 
were 
referred 
for 
treatment 
by 
pediatricians 
from 
the 
Municipal 
Health 
Department. 
These 
candidates 
had 
their 
eligibility 
checked 
by 
resident 
physicians 
blinded 
to 
the 
study 
goals. 
The 
inclusion 
criteria 
were 
age 
from 
2 
to 
10 
years 
and 
beginning 
of 
respiratory 
obstructive 
symptoms 
during 
sleep 
at 
least 
3 
months 
previously. 
The 
exclusion 
criteria 
were: 
presence 
of 
craniofacial, 
genetic 
or 
neurological 
abnormalities, 
asthma 
or 
another 
chronic 
pulmonary 
disease 
and 
nasal 
polyposis. 
The 
objectives, 
risks 
and 
benefits 
of 
the 
study 
were 
explained 
to 
the 
parents 
or 
people 
responsible 
for 
the 
children. 
They 
were 
invited 
to 
observe 
the 
signs 
and 
symptoms 
of 
the 
children 
for 
a 
2-week 
period. 
Those 
who 
accepted 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
study 
signed 
the 
informed 
consent. 
Then 
the 
parents 
or 
guardians 
were 
interviewed 
and 
the 
children 
were 
examined. 
The 
size 
of 
the 
palatine 
tonsils 
at 
oroscopy 
was 
classified 
according 
to 
criteria 
defined 
by 
Brodsky 
[5]. 
Preoperative 
laboratory 
tests 
were 
requested 
(blood 
count 
and 
coagulogram), 
electrocardiography 
and 
X-ray 
study 
of 
the 
rhinopharynx 
and 
chest. 


The 
patients 
selected 
underwent 
an 
oximetric 
study 
the 
evening 
before 
the 
surgery. 
For 
this 
study 
an 
Ohmeda 
oximeter 
model 
37001 
was 
used, 
which 
has 
a 
memory 
for 
up 
to 
8 
h 
of 
study. 
If 
the 
child 
had 
some 
airway 
infection 
at 
the 
time, 
the 
study 
and 
surgical 
procedure 
were 
not 
performed. 
The 
room 
was 
monitored 
by 
two 
nurse-technicians 
during 
the 
night. 
A 
previously 
trained 
resident 
of 
pediatrics, 
under 
supervision 
of 
the 
researcher, 
was 
responsible 
for 
preparing 
and 
instructing 
the 
patient 
and 
person 
responsible 
for 
him/her 
about 
the 
test. 
The 
sensor 
was 
fixed 
at 
the 
extremity 
of 
the 
upper 
limb, 
preferably 
the 
second 
finger.

of 
the 
sensor 
a 
splint 
was 
used 
with 
adhesive 
tape. 
The 
parents 
or 
person 
responsible 
was 
instructed 
on 
operating 
the 
equipment 
in 
order 
to 
switch 
it 
on 
or 
off 
in 
case 
the 
child 
needed 
to 
go 
to 
the 
bathroom, 
or 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
test 
when 
the 
child 
woke 
up. 
The 
test 
was 
considered 
valid 
if 
it 
lasted 
for 
a 
period 
equal 
to 
or 
more 
than 
4 
h 
[6]. 
The 
variables 
studied 
were 
the 
oxygen 
desaturation 
index 
(ODI) 
which 
was 
defined 
as 
the 
total 
number 
of 
desaturations 
>4% 
divided 
by 
the 
number 
of 
hours 
of 
the 
test, 
total 
number 
of 
desaturations 
>4%, 
percentage 
of 
desaturation 
time 
below 
95 
and 
90% 
and 
mean 
and 
minimum 
saturation 
values. 


All 
surgeries 
were 
performed 
in 
the 
morning 
and 
by 
the 
same 
surgeon. 
After 
induction 
of 
anesthesia, 
the 
rhinopharynx 
was 
evaluated 
to 
check 
and 
classify 
pharyngeal 
tonsil 
hyperplasia 
(adenoids) 
using 
a 
flexible 
Machida1 
fiberoptic 
nasolaryngoscope 
(Fig. 
1). 
After 
surgery 
the 
patients 
remained 
for 
at 
least 
4 
h 
in 
the 
anesthetic 
recovery 
room, 
and 
were 
then 
discharged 
to 
the 
ward. 
The 
volume 
of 
the 
palatine 
tonsils 
was 
noted 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
procedure 
and 
was 
obtained 
from 
the 
difference 
of 


volume 
between 
a 
known 
quantity 
of 
saline 
with 
and 
without 
the 
tonsils 
in 
a 
graduated 
flask. 


The 
patients 
were 
discharged 
from 
hospital 
the 
day 
after 
the 
procedure 
unless 
some 
surgical 
complication 
occurred. 
The 
patients 
were 
submitted 
to 
another 
evaluation 
as 
outpatients 
after 
1 
week, 
when 
the 
days 
to 
perform 
the 
new 
oximetric 
study 
were 
defined, 
in 
a 
period 
of 
not 
less 
than 
4 
weeks. 
On 
the 
day 
of 
the 
postoperative 
oximetric 
test, 
the 
children 
were 
again 
submitted 
to 
the 
questionnaire. 


The 
oximetric 
variables 
before 
and 
after 
surgery 
were 
analyzed 
using 
the 
Student 
t 
or 
Wilcoxon 
test, 
according 
to 
the 
data 
distribution. 
In 
order 
to 
check 
the 
association 
between 
the 
anthropometric 
data 
and 
the 
physical 
exam 
with 
the 
preoperative 
oximetric 
findings, 
it 
was 
planned 
to 
use 
the 
Pearson 
or 
Spearman 
correlation 
test, 
according 
to 
the 
distribution 
of 
variables. 
The 
data 
were 
tabulated 
and 
analyzed 
using 
the 
Excel1 
and 
SPSS1 
version 
11.0 
programs. 
The 
anthropometric 
data 
were 
analyzed 
using 
the 
Nutristat1 
program 
of 
the 
Epi-Info 
20021 
package. 
This 
study 
received 
approval 
from 
the

Results 
Of 
the 
35 
patients 
eligible 
for 
the 
study, 
8 
did 
not 
undergo 
postoperative 
oximetry, 
and 
27 
completed 
the 
study. 
The 
mean 
age 
was 
5.2 
. 
1.8 
years. 
Eighteen 
patients 
(67.7%) 
were 
male 
and 
22 
(81.5%) 
were 
white. 
Most 
of 
the 
parents 
or 
guardians 
(63%) 
had 
not 
finished 
elementary 
school. 
The 
most 
frequent 
clinical 
complaints 
were 
snoring 
(100%), 
respiratory 
pauses 
during 
sleep 
(96.3%), 
nocturnal 
breathing 
through 
the 
mouth 
(96.3%), 
restless 
sleep 
(81.5%) 
and 
sialorrhea 
(74.1%) 
(Table 
2). 
Most 
of 
the 
patients 
presented 
hyperplasia 
of 
the 
pharyngeal 
and 
palatine 
tonsils 
classified 
as 
grade 
3 
or 
4 
(96.3 
and 
85.2%, 
respectively). 
Six 
(22.2%) 
children 
(three 
of 
them 
male) 
were 
below 
the 
25th 
percentile 
of 
weight 
for 
age 
and 
3 
(25.9%) 
children 
(2 
of 
them 
male) 
were 
above 
the 
75th 
percentile. 


All 
the 
surgeries 
occurred 
without 
intra 
or 
postoperative 
complications. 
The 
mean 
time 
of 
surgery 
was 
42.9 
. 
13.8 
min. 
The 
volume 
of 
the 
palatine 
tonsils 
was 
10.18 
. 
3.11 
ml, 
with 
a 
variation 
of 
5— 
18 
ml. 
The 
results 
of 
the 
oximetric 
studies 
are 
described 
in 
Table 
3. 
All 
of 
the 
patients 
noticed 
an 
improvement 
of 
symptoms 
after 
surgery, 
except 
in 
two 
cases 
in 
which 
the 
children 
still 
continued 
to 
snore 
at 
night. 
Of 
these 
two 
patients, 
one 
still 
continued 
to 
present 
significant 
desaturations 
during 
the 
postoperative 
period 
(ODI 
= 
4.5).

Discussion 
It 
is 
estimated 
that 
the 
prevalence 
of 
primary 
snore 
is 
between 
3.2 
and 
12.1% 
among 
the 
general 
pediatric 
population. 
OSAHS 
is 
present 
in 
a 
lower 
proportion 
in 
these 
children, 
and 
the 
results 
of 
the 
studies 
vary 
from 
0.7 
to 
10.3% 
[7]. 
In 
children 
with 
SBD 
referred 
for 
investigation, 
the 
proportion 
of 
children 
with 
SAHOS 
diagnosed 
by 
polysomnography 
may 
reach 
70% 
[8—11]. 
Although 
polysomnography 
is 
considered 
the 
gold 
standard 
of 
SBD 
investigation, 
NPO 
is 
an 
interesting 
option 
for 
investigation 
because 
of 
its 
low 
cost 
and 
great 
availability. 
However, 
compared 
to 
polysomnography, 
it 
presents 
low 
sensitivity. 
In 
a 
cross-sectional 
study, 
Brouillette 
et 
al. 
evaluated 
349 
children 
referred 
for 
evaluation 
for 
SBD. 
The 
authors 
demonstrated 
that 
a 
positive 
NPO 
has 
a 
positive 
predictive 
value 
of 
97%, 
but 
a 
negative 
or 
inconclusive 
one 
has 
a 
negative 
predictive 
value 
of 
only 
57% 
[8]. 
If 
we 
use 
the 
borderline 
criteria 
presented 
by 
the 
abovementioned 
authors, 
which 
are 
the 
same 
as 
recommended 
by 
the 
American 
Thoracic 
Society 
(ODI 
. 
3), 
5 
(18.5%) 
children 
in 
this 
study 
presented 
OSAHS 
based 
on 
the 
results 
of 
NPO 
[12]. 
This 
proportion 
is 
below 
the 
results 
found 
in 
similar 
studies, 
in 
which 
the 
proportion 
of 
children 
with 
PRS 
referred 
for 
investigation 
and 
who 
presented 
OSAHS 
varied 
from 
46 
to 
70%.

So 
far 
there 
have 
been 
no 
standard 
indications 
for 
the 
treatment 
of 
SBD 
in 
children. 
Most 
of 
the 
authors 
agree 
that 
children 
with 
OSAHS 
in 
its 
severe 
form 
should 
receive 
immediate 
treatment 
because 
of 
the 
potential 
risk 
of 
cardiopulmonary 
complications. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
treatment 
for 
children 
with 
borderline 
or 
moderate 
forms 
of 
the 
disease 
is 
subject 
to 
discussion, 
mainly 
because 
little 
is 
known 
about 
the 
natural 
history 
or 
late 
consequences 
of 
mild 
OSAHS. 
However, 
there 
is 
increasing 
evidence 
that 
primary 
snoring 
could 
have 
negative 
consequences 
for 
the 
children. 
O’Brien 
et 
al 
compared 
44 
children 
with 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder 
(ADHD) 
with 
controls 
ramdonly 
selected, 
using 
a 
previously 
validated 
questionnaire 
and 
PSG. 
They 
showed 
that 
children 
with 
ADHD 
have 
more 
frequently 
SBD 
(specially 
in 
the 
REM 
sleep) 
when 
compared 
with 
controls 
( 
p 
< 
0.001) 
[13]. 
Other 
studies 
in 
Portugal 
and 
Austria 
founded 
similar 
results 
[14,15]. 
Gottlieb 
et 
al 
reported 
an 
odds 
ratio 
(OR) 
for 
hyperactivity 
and 
attention 
deficit 
of 
2.5 
(2.0 
< 
OR 
< 
3.0) 
and 
2.1 


(1.7 
< 
OR 
< 
2.6), 
respectively 
in 
744 
children 
with 
SBD 
[16]. 
Most 
of 
the 
children 
(21 
(77.8%)) 
selected 
for 
surgical 
treatment 
of 
adenotonsillar 
disease 
in 
the 
otorhinolaryngology 
outpatient 
clinic 
at 
HCSA 
were 
of 
pre-school 
age 
(2—6 
years) 
and 
62.9% 
were 
3—5 
years 
old. 
These 
results 
are 
consistent 
with 
the 
literature, 
since 
this 
period 
corresponds 
to 
thegreatestincreaseinlymphoidtissue 
as 
compared 
to 
the 
adjacent 
airway, 
resulting 
in 
a 
narrower 
airway 
[17,18]. 
A 
greater 
frequency 
of 
male 
children 
(18 
(66.7%)) 
was 
seen, 
which 
was 
not 
shown 
in 
other 
studies 
except 
for 
Gislason 
et 
al., 
where 
a 
greater 
frequency 
of 
snores 
was 
found 
in 
boys 
than 
in 
girls 
(24.3% 
versus 
16.5%) 
using 
a 
cross-sectional 
study 
of 
the 
population 
base 
in 
Iceland 
[19—21]. 
However, 
this 
difference 
couldbeexplained 
by 
thesmall 
size 
of 
thesample 
in 
this 
study. 
There 
is 
a 
known 
association 
between 
growth 
deficit 
and 
OSAHS. 
Williams 
et 
al. 
demonstrated 
that 
46% 
of 
41 
children 
with 
SBD 
referred 
for 
surgical 
treatment 
were 
at 
the 
5th 
percentile 
of 
the 
weight 
corrected 
for 
age 
[22]. 
In 
contrast 
with 
the 
previous 
study, 
in 
the 
present 
one 
the 
proportion 
of 
children 
with 
weight 
below 
the 
25th 
percentile 
was 
6 
children 
(22.2%), 
and 
no 
patient 
was 
below 
the 
5th 
percentile 
of 
weight 
for 
age. 


In 
this 
study 
there 
was 
a 
clear 
improvement 
in 
the 
main 
oximetric 
variables 
in 
all 
except 
one 
of 
the 
patients 
studied. 
This 
patient 
presented 
grade 
3 
and 
4 
hyperplasia 
of 
the 
pharyngeal 
and 
palatine 
tonsils, 
respectively 
during 
the 
preoperative 
period. 
His 
weight 
for 
age 
was 
in 
the 
28.7th 
pecentile 
according 
to 
the 
Nutristat1 
Program 
[23]. 


Considering 
the 
great 
improvement, 
both 
of 
the 
clinical 
complaints 
and 
the 
oximetry, 
in 
the 
children 
submitted 
to 
surgical 
treatment, 
it 
should 
be 
emphasized 
that 
there 
was 
a 
weak 
correlation 
between 
the 
preoperative 
ODI 
and 
the 
degrees 
of 
hyperplasia 
of 
the 
pharyngeal 
or 
platine 
tonsils, 
which 
in 
daily 
practice 
is 
a 
major 
finding 
to 
indicate 
surgical 
treatment. 
This 
finding 
agrees 
with 
the 
other 
studies 
in 
the 
literature 
[7,24,25].Itwould, 
however, 
be 
important 
to 
relate 
the 
tonsillar 
volume 
to 
the 
space 
that 
exists 
in 
the 
pharynx. 
In 
a 
narrow 
pharynx, 
even 
small 
tonsils 
can 
significantly 
compromise 
the 
airway. 
In 
adults, 
OSAHS 
appears 
to 
be 
of 
multifactorial 
origin, 
and 
genetic 
and 
neuromuscular 
factors 
may 
be 
an 
important 
factor. 
Likewise, 
in 
children 
other 
factors 
besides 
the 
volumetric 
increase 
of 
the 
Waldeyer 
ring 
may 
contribute 
to 
the 
disease 
[26]. 
The 
oxymetric 
values 
are 
obtained 
comparing 
the 
absortion 
ratio 
of 
the 
red/infrared 
light 
of 
the 
oximetry 
with 
the 
memory 
stored 
data 
(previously 
detected 
from 
healthy 
subjects). 
But 
the 
oxymeter 
could 
measure 
the 
movement 
of 
the 
patient 
as 
oxymetric 
data, 
showingafalseoxygendesaturationasthe 
result. 
This 
error 
could 
be 
managed 
comparing 
the 
oxymetric 
data 
with 
the 
pulse 
rate, 
as 
we 
done 
in 
this 
study 
[8]. 
However, 
our 
study 
is 
limited 
since 
we 
didn’t 
compared 
the 
oxymetric 
data 
with 
PSG. 
Although 
this 
fact, 
but 
in 
agreement 
with 
other 
several 
studies, 
we 
believe 
that 
NPO 
could 
be 
an 
important 
diagnostic 
tool 
since 
a 
positive 
result 
is 
frequently 
related 
with 
an 
abnormal 
PSG. 
Using 
this 
knowledge, 
it 
will 
be 
possible 
to 
screen 
the 
more 
severe 
children 
with 
SBD 
symptoms 
requiring 
surgery 
and 
preventing 
postoperative 
complications. 
In 
the 
other 
hand, 
negative 
or 
inconclusive 
results 
should 
require 
a 
subsequent 
PSG. 


It 
is 
concluded 
that 
adenotonsillectomy 
has 
a 
beneficial 
effect 
on 
oxygen 
saturation 
measured 
by 
pulseoximetryinchildrenwithcomplaintsof 
respiratory 
obstruction 
during 
the 
night. 
However, 
children 
who 
continue 
to 
present 
symptoms 
during 
the 
postoperative 
period 
should 
be 
investigated, 
since 
they 
may 
continue 
to 
have 
oxygen 
desaturations 
that 
could 
be 
caused 
by 
conditions 
other 
than 
hyperplasia 
of 
the 
lymphoid 
tissue 
of 
the 
pharynx.
