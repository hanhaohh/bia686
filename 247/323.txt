The purpose of this study was to examine craniofacial morphology, pharyngeal airway space and 
hyoid bone position in preschool children with sleep-related breathing disorder associated with 
hypertrophy of tonsils (SBDT). Thirty-eight preschool children, mean age 4.7y, with SBDT and 
with an apnoea index (AI) of 0 < AI <5, were divided into two groups. One consisted of 15 
children with sleep-related breathing disorder (SBD) and more than 75% of the tonsils visible 
(GIII)and the other of 23 children with SBD and 25ñ75% of the tonsils visible (GII). The control 
group consisted of 31 children without ear, nose and throat disease and with GI (barely visible) 
tonsils. Compared with the controls, GIII children had a retrognathic mandible, a large posterior 
facial height,alarge interincisal angle with retroclined lowerincisors,anarrowpharyngeal airway 
space, an anterior tongue base position and a long soft palate. Compared with the controls, GII 
childrenhad a large anterior lowerfacialheight and a short nasalèoor.However, likethecontrols, 
GIIchildren did not have a retrognathic mandible. 

Conclusion: The.ndingsshow that childrenwithSBDTdisplay acharacteristicfacial appearance 
at an early age. Since the condition has an effect on growth, it needs to be prevented by 
controlling morphology andfunctionatthe preschool age.

The primarycause ofsleep-relatedbreathingdisorder is 
hypertrophyofadenoids and tonsilsin children(1,2) 
andobesityinmiddle-aged orclimacteric adults(3,4). 

In general, lymphoid tissues develop rapidly after 
birth, reach their maximum size in early childhood, 
begintoregressaround8ñ10yofageand are usually 
completely atrophiedby12ñ14y(5).In some children, 
excessive growth of lymphoid tissues can lead to 
obstruction of the pharyngeal airway space, especially 
duringsleep, which may cause breathingproblems, and 
disturbed sleep, speech, eating and swallowing (6). 
Behlfelt (7) reported that schoolchildren with enlarged 
tonsilshaveamore retrognathicandposteriorlyinclined 
mandible, large anterior total and lower facial heights, 
retroclined lower incisors, protruding upper incisors, 
small overbite, large overjet, an extensional posture of 
the head and a low hyoid bone position. Some authors 
have reported that malocclusion, such as anterior open 
bite and lateral cross-bite, seems to be a result of the 
obstruction, since a signi.cant improvement occurred 
after adenotonsillectomy(8,9), whereas self-correction 
is not common. Ingeneral, occlusalaberrations tendto 

deteriorate during the growth period in children, 
especiallyduringthe transitionfrompreschoolto school 
age (10).Ithasalsobeenreportedthatsleepdisorderhas 
an inèuence on the endocrine system, especially the 
secretionof growthhormone(11,12).Therefore, early 
diagnosis and treatment of preschool children with 
hypertrophy of adenoids and enlarged tonsils is necessary 
because the sleep disorder may induce a growth 
disorder (6, 13, 14). To characterize the early growthrelatedchanges 
in craniofacial morphology, pharyngeal 
airwayspaceandhyoidboneposition, thereisaneedfor 
investigation in young children. 

The purpose of this study was to describe the 
craniofacial morphology and hyoid bone position in a 
sampleofpreschool children withsleep-relatedbreathing 
disorder associated with hypertrophy of tonsils 
(SBDT).

1, consisted of preschool children who visited the 
Saitama Prefecture ChildrenísMedicalCenter in Japan 
betweenApril1995andMarch2000.The childrenwere 
informed by one paediatric otolaryngologist and one 
paediatricorthodontistthattheywouldbeadmittedfora 
more detailed examination if they showed an apnoea 
index(AI)inthe range0 < AI <5 onthe polysomnograph(
Apnomonitor II, ChestMI1).The AI is themean 
numberofapnoeic episodesperhourofsleep,wherethe 
apnoeic episode was de.ned as the cessation of airèow 
throughthe noseand mouthformorethan10s(15,16). 
Children with SBDT were monitored at home during 
nocturnalsleepfor3nightsbytheparentswhohadbeen 
informed about the use of the polysomnograph and, 
subsequently, a detailed sleep study was performed in 
thehospital.The valueoftheAI,calculatedfor2 nights 
(excluding the .rst night) (15), was in the range 

0.5 µAI µ4.8 (mean 1.4 ß0.9). On the basis of the 
ratio of the tonsils to the oropharynx as measured 
transversallybetweentheanterior pillars,astandardized 
grading classi.cation was used: GI (control): barely 
visible, tonsil in the fossa or <25% visible; GII: 
between 25% and 75% visible; GIII: >75% visible 
(6).The evaluationwasperformedby an ear, noseand 
throat (ENT) specialist (HS). Thirty-eight preschool 
children withSBDT were dividedinto two groups. One 
consisted of15 children withGIIItonsils, andthe other 
of23children withGII.Inaddition,clinical manifestations 
of children with SBDT included chronic mouth 
breathing and snoring during sleeping. The control 
group (31 children) had both incisor crowding of the 
maxilla and/or mandible, and GI without SBDT, they 
didnotsnoreandhadno historyofrespiratorydisorders, 
suchasmouthbreathing orsleepapnoea.Noneofthe69 
subjects was obese, and none had anatomical craniofacial 
abnormalities,neurological or cardiac disease.All 
children had primary dentition, they did not have a 
malocclusion and none had missing teeth, crown 
decayedby dental caries ora thumb-sucking habit. 
During the cephalometric registration, the children 
sat in a chair in an upright position, keeping the 
dentition in naturalocclusion, andthey were instructed 
to breathe slowlythroughthe nose(thiswas practised) 
and not to swallow. The lateral cephalograms were 
takenwiththeFrankforthorizontal(FH)paralleltoboth 
the èoor and the lower border of the radiograph, 
although this position was sometimes dif.cult to 
achieve. The radiographs of the 69 children were 
selectedfromalarger sample andincludedifthehead 
position fell within the range of ß5∞ between the 
bottom line of the radiograph and the FH. Another 
inclusion criterion was the facial type, based on the 
angle betweenthemandibular lineandtheFH(ML/ 
FH); children with a hypodivergent facial type were 
excluded(ML/FH <23.3)fromthe controlgroup, since 
no such children were found in the other groups. 
Childrenwith eithera neutralfacialtype(23.3 µML/ 
FH µ31.1) orahyperdivergentfacialtype(31.1 < ML/ 

FH) were included. Sincechildren withENTdisorders 
generallyhavea hyperdivergent facial type(longface 
type), there were no children withENTdisorders and a 
hypodivergent facial type. All cephalograms were 
obtained before any oral,medical or surgicalintervention 
was undertaken. 

Cephalometric analysis 

The variables of the craniofacial skeleton, dentition, 
pharyngealairwayspaceandhyoidbone positionwere 
measured using cephalometric landmarks as illustrated

The differences among the three groups, compared 
internally (GIIIñGII, GIIIñGI and GIIIñGI), were 

ACTAP∆DIATR91(2002) 

determined using the w 2-test for independence. The 
differences between each variable of the three groups 
were determined by the KruskalñWallis test. The 
differencesbetween GIII, GII andGI(control group) 
were determined by the MannñWhitney U-test after 
performing theKruskalñWallis test. 

Results 

There were no differences in age, facial types or AI 
between childrenwithGIII andGIItonsils(Table1). 

Comparedwiththe controls,thechildrenwithSBDT 
had a retrognathic mandible (facial axis andlocation of 
pogonion), a large anterior lower facial height and 
posteriorfacialheight, a short nasalèoor (ansñpns), a 
large interincisal angle with retroclined lower incisors 
(L1toML),a narrowpharyngealairwayspace(dñad1, 
dñptv and upper pharynx), an anterior tongue base 
position(lower pharynx) and along softpalate(Tables 
2, 3). There were no signi.cant differences in the 
cranial base angulation or hyoidbone position. 

Compared withthe controlgroup(GI), children with 
SBD andGIIIhad a retrognathicmandible(facial axis

Discussion 

Unlike in adults, polysomnography in children has 
shown a low sensitivity for identifying typical symptoms 
of nocturnal obstruction (25ñ27). When the 
criterion that AI >1 should be considered abnormal 
(16)was usedinthepresentstudy,adiagnosisinvolving 
asleepdisorderwascon.rmedin21(GIII11,GII10)of 
the38 childrenwith enlarged tonsils.However, deviationsfromthenormal 
mayalsobe evidentin children 
withAI <1, and thus all 38 children were included in 

 

theinvestigation.Agrenetal.(26)proposedthatwhen 
evaluating nocturnalobstructive breathingin children,a 
combination of laboratory diagnostic indicators, such 
as respiratory body movements, electromyographic 
(EMG) activity in accessory muscles and oxygen 
saturation, should be considered. Since it is important 
for preschoolchildrento sleepasnaturallyaspossible,a 
sleep-screening test of the subjects was performed at 
homeby simple polysomnography. 

The present.ndings of dentoalveolar characteristics 
were similar to those reported for children with large 
adenoids, enlarged tonsils andnasopharyngealobstructions(
7,8).According toMossandSalentijn (28),the 
developmentof the facialbones depends on the balance 
between the different tissues within the ìorofacial 
capsuleî. For instance, if the tongue is not functioning 
properly, there will be changes in the development of 
the maxilla and mandible. In terms of this hypothesis, it 
seems reasonable to assume that, in preschool children 
with nasopharyngeal obstructions, the mandible is 
lowered to create space for the tongue and ultimately

make breathing easier. When the low mandibular 
position is prolonged, the change in its posture might 
inèuence dentoalveolar morphology, leadingto a retrognathic 
and posteriorly inclined mandible, a large 
anterior lowerfacial height andposteriorfacial height, 
a short nasalèoor and a large interincisal angle with 
retroclinedlower incisors.Thesefeatures haverecently 
been foundin preschoolchildren withobstructive sleep 
apnoea syndrome (OSAS) (20). In contrast to the 

.ndings of the present study, Shintani et al. (29) 
reported that the hyoid bone is in a low position in 
children with OSAS. However, since cephalograms 
cannot be taken during sleep, preschool children may 
have different severities of inadequately diagnosed 
breathing dif.culties (9). Nocturnal breathing in the 
preschoolchildrenwithsleepdisorderinthis study may

hyoidbone position. 
In contrasttopreschoolchildrenwithOSAS,whichis 
amore severe condition,preschoolchildrenwithSBDT 
did notdisplay alargegonialangle(20,29).Ordinarily, 
a large gonialangle is associatedwith a short posterior 
facial height, whereas in the present investigation, the 
increasedposterior facialheight and a ìnormalî gonial 
angle seemed to be related to a more correct maintenanceofthe 
patencyofthe pharyngealairwaythanin 
OSASchildren. 

Diamond(30)statedthat,froma clinical standpoint, 
tonsilsizeisdif.culttoevaluatein children. Behlfelt(7) 
proposed that it is, therefore, arguable whether tonsils 
can be described as enlarged since there is no 
recognized ìnormalî size. In the present study, an 
ENTspecialist performedthe grading using a standard 
grading classi.cation (6) based on the transverse 
relationship of the tonsils to the oropharynx as 
measured between the anterior pillars. Preschool children 
with maximal tonsil size had a retrognathic and 
posteriorly inclined mandible (clockwise rotation), and 
a large posterior facialheight,whichisin line withthe 
reportedcharacteristic mandibular clockwise rotation of

older children with enlarged tonsils (7). In addition, 
children with GIII had a narrower pharyngeal airway 
space than the control group, and a signi.cantly larger 
value regarding the size of the lower pharynx, i.e. in 
children with GIII, the tongue base was in an anterior 
position. Although the same was not the case for 
childrenwithGII,itcouldbe arguedthatthemandibular 
position had an impact on the size of the posterior 
airway space (20). 

Theeffectofairway obstructionmightbe seen asa 
short nasalèoor.However, childrenwithGIIIdid not 
displayashortenednasalèoorlengthcomparedwiththe 
control group(Table4), suggestingthattheseverityof 
AI is not always associated with enlarged tonsils. 
Furthermore, this classi.cation of tonsils showed that 
there was no differencebetweenchildren withGII and 
GIII regarding the AI. 

Hultcrantzetal.(9) claimed that,2yafter tonsillectomy,
77% oftheopen bitesand50ñ65%ofthebuccal 
and anterior cross-bites were normalized. They concluded 
that the best results were seen in children 
operated on before the age of 6y, i.e. at preschool 
age. However,itisimportantforparentstobeinformed, 
for instance, about surgical risks and the craniofacial 
developmentof preschool childrenwithSBDT.Asthe 
condition evidently has an effect on growth, it needs to 
be prevented by controlling both morphology and 
function inpreschool age.
