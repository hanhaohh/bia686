Abstract 


Objecti6e: 
Outpatient 
tonsillectomy 
and:or 
adenoidectomy 
is 
the 
procedure 
of 
choice 
in 
the 
US, 
whereas 
in 
Europe, 
the 
transition 
from 
the 
traditional 
duration 
of 
hospital 
stay 
to 
same 
day 
discharge 
slowly 
increases. 
This 
trial 
was 
conducted 
to 
find 
factors, 
which 
influence 
surgery 
on 
an 
outpatient 
basis 
and 
to 
find 
possible 
positive 
and 
negative 
predictive 
conditions 
in 
patients. 
Methods: 
Most 
trials, 
which 
argue 
for 
a 
same 
day 
discharge 
take 
the 
low 
percentage 
of 
postoperative 
hemorrhage 
into 
account. 
Hemorrhage, 
apnea 
and 
infections 
are 
complications 
and 
have 
to 
be 
distinguished 
from 
sequelae 
such 
as 
poor 
oral 
intake 
(with 
consecutive 
i.v. 
fluid 
supply), 
fever 
and 
protracted 
vomiting, 
that 
also 
should 
be 
considered 
as 
discharge 
criteria. 
Complications 
as 
well 
as 
sequelae 
were 
measured 
in 
114 
consecutive 
children, 
and 
the 
patients 
divided 
into 
an 
adenotonsillectomy 
group 
and 
an 
adenoidectomy 
group. 
Results: 
Patients 
from 
both 
groups 
that 
underwent 
surgery 
because 
of 
severe 
obstructive 
symptoms 
had 
significantly 
more 
sequelae 
than 
those 
indicated 
because 
of 
chronic 
or 
recurrent 
infections. 
They 
could 
not 
have 
been 
discharged 
in 
an 
acceptable 
condition. 
Due 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
most 
children 
after 
adenoidectomy 
recovered 
well 
8 
h 
postoperatively, 
they 
could 
have 
been 
discharged 
on 
the 
same 
day. 
Children 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
had 
significantly 
more 
sequelae. 
There 
was 
a 
tendency 
that 
adenotonsillectomy 
children 
with 
only 
mild 
obstructions 
could 
have 
been 
discharged 
either 
8 
or 
at 
least 
24 
h 
postoperatively. 
It 
still 
remains 
the 
surgeon’s 
decision 
when 
a 
child 
can 
be 
discharged 
safely.

Introduction 
The 
earliest 
description 
of 
tonsillectomy 
appears 
in 
the 
medical 
encyclopedia 
of 
Cornelius 
Celsus 
in 
AD 
30. 
The

obviously 
evolved 
from 
this 
period 
either 
by 
dissection 
as 
described 
by 
Waugh 
in 
1909 
or 
use 
of 
the 
hemostatic 
guillotine 
devised 
by 
Popper 
in 
1929 
[1]. 
The 
popularity 
of 
tonsillectomy 
came 
to 
a 
peak 
during 
the 
‘preantibiotic 
era’ 
because 
of 
the 
general 
anxiety 
of 
rheumatic 
fever 
caused 
by 
the 
tonsils 
as 
streptococcal 
A 
carriers. 
Performed 
tonsillectomies 
were 
most 
numerous 
in 
1959 
(1.4 
million 
in 
the 
USA) 
and 
declined 
thereafter.

though 
the 
total 
number 
of 
tonsillectomies 
has 
declined, 
this 
operation 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
frequent 
procedures 
done 
in 
almost 
every 
country 
[2]. 


In 
the 
US, 
tonsillectomy 
and:or 
adenoidectomy 
is 
commonly 
performed 
on 
an 
outpatient 
basis, 
whereas 
in 
Europe, 
the 
transition 
from 
the 
traditional 
duration 
of 
hospital 
stay 
to 
same 
day 
discharge 
slowly 
increases. 
Changing 
the 
inpatient 
policy 
for 
adenotonsillectomy 
will 
also 
create 
new 
social 
consequences. 
Lack 
of 
parental 
awareness 
of 
a 
normal 
postoperative 
course 
can 
result 
in 
unnecessary 
visits 
to 
the 
physician’s 
office 
or 
the 
emergency 
room, 
or 
may 
cause 
unnecessary 
or 
even 
dangerous 
delays 
in 
seeking 
treatment 
when 
needed 
[3]. 
There 
is 
increasing 
pressure 
from 
the 
government 
and 
the 
insurance 
carriers 
to 
stem 
rising 
health 
care 
costs 
in 
Switzerland. 
Outpatient 
procedures 
are 
thus 
eyed 
favorably. 
At 
the 
Children’s 
University 
Hospital 
of 
Zurich 
it 
has 
been 
the 
policy 
to 
absorb 
the 
greater 
cost 
of 
the 
longer 
admittance 
caused 
by 
the 
inpatient 
program 
for 
tonsillectomy 
and:or 
adenoidectomy 
in 
the 
perceived 
interest 
of 
postoperative 
patient 
safety 
and 
comfort. 
The 
main 
question 
focused 
on 
in 
this 
study 
is 
whether 
an 
outpatient 
approach 
to 
tonsillectomy 
and:or 
adenoidectomy 
is 
of 
greater 
benefit 
than 
the 
already 
well 
proven 
inpatient 
procedure 
for 
children 
at 
the 
Children’s 
University 
Hospital. 
To 
our 
knowledge 
most 
surveys 
which 
argue 
for 
a 
same 
day 
discharge 
considered

With

study 
we 
wanted

factors 
should 
be 
taken 
into 
account 
to 
evaluate 
the

of

2. 
Patients 
and 
methods 
The 
current 
indications 
and 
contraindications 
for 
adenotonsillectomy 
(T&A) 
and 
adenoidectomy 
(A) 
used 
are 
well 
established 
and 
in 
accordance 
with 
authors 
such 
as 
Paradise 
et 
al. 
[4], 
Riding 
et 
al. 
[5] 
and 
Deutsch 
et 
al. 
[6]. 
A 
prospective 
non-randomized 
cohort 
study 
was 
conducted 
with 
114 
consecutive 
children 
from 
all 
socioeconomic 
levels, 
who 
were 
evaluated 
for 
A 
(52 
patients) 
or 
T&A 
(63 
patients) 
from 
April 
1997 
until 
March 
1998 
at 
the 
ENT 
Unit 
of 
the 
Children’s 
University 
Hospital 
of 
Zurich. 
The 
mean 
age 
for 
adenoidectomy 
(A) 
was 
4.7 
years 
(23:12–105:12) 
and 
for 
the 
adenotonsillectomy 
(T&A) 
was 
6.1 
years 
(28:12–157:12). 


The 
selection 
of 
the 
children 
for 
this 
study 
was 
done 
at 
the 
ambulatory 
otorhinolaryngologic 
ward 
of 
the 
University 
Children’s 
Hospital 
of 
Zurich. 
Patients 
selected 
for 
A 
or 
T&A 
were 
examined 
for 
possible 
exclusion 
criteria 
listed 
in 
Table 
1. 
The 
children 
in 
our 
survey 
underwent 
either 
A 
or 
T&A 
exclusively. 
The 
only 
additional 
operations 
were 
otomicroscopy, 
myringotomy 
or 
insertion 
of 
grommets 
but 
no 
other 
treatment. 


All 
patients 
were 
seen 
by 
a 
pediatrician 
preoperatively, 
either 
by 
their 
family 
doctor 
(in 
Switzerland 
usually 
a 
pediatrician) 
or 
at 
the 
Children’s 
University 
Hospital 
in 
Zurich. 
Therefore 
any 
underlying 
major 
medical 
problem 
was 
detected 
(Table 
1) 
precluding 
operating 
on 
an 
outpatient 
basis. 
The 
patient’s 
history 
of 
any 
illnesses 
was 
carefully 
explored 
at 
the 
initial 
presentation, 
questions 
were 
also 
asked 
about 
a 
bleeding 
tendency 
within 
the 
family 
or 
the 
patient 
in 
a 
questionnaire 
handed 
out 
to 
each 
patient 
or 
parent. 
Any 
suspicion 
led 
to 
hematological 
investigation 
such 
as 
bleeding 
time, 
platelet 
count, 
partial 
thromboplastin 
time 
(PTT) 
and 
prothrombin 
time 
(PT); 
114 
patients 
were 
included 
in 
this 
study 
and 
divided 
into 
subgroups 
according 
to 
type 
of 
surgery 
and 
age 
(Table

Prospective 
data 
were 
collected 
at 
daily 
visits 
and 
compared 
with 
the 
hospital 
nursing 
records; 
these 
data 
were 
used 
to 
fill 
follow-up 
sheets 
for 
each 
patient. 
The 
acquired 
demographic 
data 
included 
age, 
sex, 
weight, 
length, 
and 
body 
surface 
area 
(m2). 
The 
type 
of 
surgery 
and 
indications, 
drugs 
given 
during 
the 
perioperative 
and 
postoperative 
period, 
amount 
of 
oral 
intake, 
i.v. 
fluid

in 
relation 
to 
body 
surface, 
length 
of 
stay 
following 
admission 
to 
the 
postanesthesia 
care 
unit, 
episodes 
of 
vomiting 
and 
bleeding, 
amount 
of 
pain, 
fever 
and 
overall 
state 
were 
recorded. 


The 
indications 
for 
A 
and 
T&A 
were 
divided 
into 
either 
upper 
airway 
obstruction, 
recurrent 
infections 
or 
both. 
Mild 
obstruction 
was 
defined 
by 
occurrence 
of 
snoring 
and 
se6ere 
airway 
obstruction 
by 
the 
presence 
of 
apnea 
episodes 
of 
\7 
s 
and 
20–30 
episodes 
during 
sleep. 
Apnea 
episodes 
were 
measured 
by 
pulsoxymeter 
at 
home 
(with 
a 
Minolta-Pulsox-3i™) 
or 
the 
night 
before 


surgery 
in 
the 
hospital. 
In 
the 
group 
of 
patients 
with 
recurrent 
infections 
there 
were 
patients 
with 
chronic 
recurrent 
tonsillitis, 
recurrent 
acute 
otitis 
media 
(AOM) 
or 
chronic 
infections 
of 
the 
adenoid 
with 
consecutive 
chronic 
recurrent 
upper 
respiratory 
tract 
infections 
(URI) 
(Table 
3). 
Each 
patient 
was 
cautioned 
not 
to 
take 
acetylsalicylic 
acid 
(e.g. 
Aspirin®) 
at 
least 
2 
weeks 
prior 
to 
the 
surgery. 


Every 
patient 
in 
this 
survey 
underwent 
the 
same 
standard 
general 
anesthesia 
technique: 


1. 
Premedication: 
Flunitrazepam 
(Rohypnol®) 
p.o. 
0.05 
mg:kg, 
max. 
2 
mg 
(for 
underlying 
medical 
problems 
such 
as 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea: 
Midazolam 
(Dormicum®) 
0.5 
mg:kg). 
2. 
Induction: 
N2O:O2 
(ratio: 
1:1) 
plus 
Sevoflurane 
(Sevorane®). 
3. 
Intubation 
(without 
muscle 
relaxant 
drugs). 
4. 
Intraoperatively, 
one 
single 
dose 
of 
analgesics: 
Paracetamol 
(Panadol®) 
supp. 
25–30 
mg:kg 
(no 
opioids 
or 
steroids 
were 
administered). 
The 
standard 
surgical 
technique 
for 
tonsillectomy 
was: 
local 
infiltration 
with 
2 
ml 
bupivacain 
(Carbostesin®) 
0.25% 
with 
adrenaline 
1:200 
000, 
incision 
of 
the 
mucosa, 
identification 
of 
the 
tonsillar 
capsule, 
then 
blunt 
dissection 
of 
tonsil 
with 
its 
inferior 
pole 
coagulated 
and 
severed. 
Hemostasis 
of 
the 
tonsillar 
bed 
was 
obtained 
with 
packs 
and 
if 
necessary 
with 
electrocautery. 
No 
sutures 
were 
used. 
For 
adenoidectomy, 
the 
surgeon 
used 
an 
adenoid 
curette 
and 
packing 
for 
its 
hemostasis. 
In 
children 
below 
the 
age 
of 
four, 
adenoidectomy 
is 
done 
under 
transnasal 
endoscopic 
control. 


The 
postoperative 
routine 
therapy 
consisted 
of: 
Analgesics 


. 
Paracetamol 
(Panadol®) 
supp. 
25–30 
mg:kg, 
distributed 
equally 
throughout 
the 
day: 
in 
four 
doses, 
max. 
100 
mg:kg 
per 
day 
as 
a 
continuous 
analgesia 
for 
the 
first 
24 
h 
after 
surgery. 
. 
Rescue 
morphine: 
Nalbuphin 
(Nubain®) 
i.v. 
0.1–0.3 
mg:kg 
per 
day 
maximally 
every 
4 
h 
for 
the 
first 
8 
h 
postoperatively. 
Antiemetics 
(have

Definitions 
and 
assessment 
of 
postoperati6e 
sequelae 
Postoperati6e 
sequelae 
in 
this 
study 
mean 
any 
postoperative 
problem 
such 
as 
mild 
hemorrhage 


(i.e. 
no 
additional 
treatment 
required), 
fever, 
emesis, 
or 
reduced 
oral 
intake. 
Postoperati6e 
complications 
were 
infections 
imperatively 
treated 
with 
antibiotics, 
hemorrhage 
in 
need 
of 
further 
treatment 
(observation 
in 
the 
intermediate 
care 
unit, 
cold 
packs 
or 
revision 
surgery) 
and 
edema 
of 
the 
oro-pharyngeal 
tract. 
Routine 
care 
in 
this 
study 
was 
defined 
by 
the 
use 
of 
analgesics, 
rectal 
or 
i.v. 
and 
antiemetics 
as 
described. 


Additional 
care 
included 
i.v. 
fluid 
administration, 
opioids 
(later 
than 
after 
the 
first 
8 
h), 
antibiotics, 
corticosteroids 
and 
oxygen. 
They 
were 
all 
prescribed 
by 
the 
anesthesiology 
and:or 
ENT 
staff. 


Postoperati6e 
hemorrhage 
was 
defined 
as 
any 
hemorrhage 
requiring 
medical 
intervention. 
This 
included 
patients 
where 
the 
hemorrhage 
was 
controlled 
on 
the

measures 
and 
also 
those 
patients 
returned 
to 
the 
operating 
room 
for 
revision 
surgery. 
Primary 
hemorrhage 
was 
defined 
as 
occurring 
within 
24 
h 
of 
surgery, 
and 
secondary 
hemorrhage 
as 
any 
bleeding 
thereafter. 


Table

Discharge 
criteria 


The 
patient 
is 
awake 
and 
alert 
and 
has 
vital 
signs 
(temperature, 
blood 
pressure, 
pulse 
and 
respiratory 
status) 
within 
normal 
range 
for 
the 
age 
and 
emotional 
status 
The 
patient 
is 
mobile 
(within 
the 
normal 
range 
for 
that 


individual) 
and 
is 
drinking 
and 
tolerating 
fluids. 
Patients 
after 
A 
or 
T&A 
are 
sent 
home 
prior 
to 
the 
resumption 
of 
normal 
oral 
fluid 
intake 
as 
long 
as 
the 
hydration 
state 
is 
acceptable 
(no 
signs 
of 
dehydration) 
[11,12] 


The 
patient’s 
pharynx 
has 
been 
checked 
for 
postoperative 


hemorrhage 
by 
the 
ENT 
staff 
Emesis 
is 
under 
control 
The 
patient’s 
pain 
is 
relieved 
by 
oral 
or 
rectal 
medication 
The 
parents 
have 
received 
written 
instructions 
and 
the 


surgeon 
is 
satisfied 
that 
they 
understand 
and 
are 
able 
to 
carry 
out 
instructions 


Fe6er 
was 
defined 
as 
a 
temperature 
above 
37.5°C 
rectally 
measured 
and 
considered 
significant 
only 
when 
persistent 
over 
the 
range 
of 
8 
h 
after 
surgery 
and 
not 
reducible 
with 
the 
basic 
analgesic:antipyretic 
drugs 
prescribed. 


Oral 
intake 
was 
monitored, 
and 
if 
signs 
of 
dehydration 
such 
as 
an 
onset 
of 
fever, 
high 
density 
of 
urine, 
or 
oligury 
arose, 
intravenous 
fluids 
were 
given 
by 
an 
anesthesiologist 
after 
consent 
with 
the 
ENT 
staff. 
Postoperatively 
the 
patients 
were 
encouraged 
to 
drink 
after 
both 
T&A 
and 
A. 


In 
any 
case 
the 
patients 
were 
left 
with 
an 
intravenous 
access 
until 
the 
danger 
of 
lack 
of 
fluid 
was 
considered 
as 
overcome. 
The 
percentage 
of 
patients 
requiring 
prolonged 
intravenous 
hydration 


(i.e. 
\8 
h 
postoperatively) 
was 
calculated 
for 
all 
groups. 
One 
or 
two 
episodes 
of 
6omiting 
during 
the 
first 
8 
h 
was 
expected 
and 
left 
untreated. 
All 
patients 
with 
more 
emesis 
were 
primarily 
treated 
with 
Itinerol 
B6
® 
supp. 
(Meclocin, 
Pyridoxin, 
Coffein) 
and 
then 
with 
Ondansetron 
(Zofran®)if 
Itinerol 
B6
® 
supp. 
was 
insufficient. 
Protracted 
6omiting 
was 
defined 
as 
postoperative 
emesis 
of 
more 
than 
twice 
in 
24 
h. 
The 
usually 
little 
amount 
of 
food 
eaten 
was 
taken 
into 
consideration, 
but 
its 
exploitation 
was 
not 
possible 
for 
reasons 
of 
inaccurate 
notation; 
furthermore, 
it 
was 
not 
a 
criterion 
for 
the 
discharge 
of 
the 
patients. 
After 
tonsillectomy 
a 
restricted 
diet 
was 
recommended 
postoperatively 
with 
emphasis 
on 
small 
and 
frequent 
intake 
of 
liquids 
and 
soft, 
lukewarm 
foods. 


Analgesics 
were 
prescribed 
not 
only 
on 
demand 
postoperatively 
but 
also 
electively 
before, 
during 
and 
after 
surgery 
in 
order 
to 
achieve 
adequate 
pain 
control 
because 
children 
are 
less 
able 
to 
adequately 
express 
discomfort. 
This 
rendered 
it 
impossible 
to 
precisely 
assess 
each 
child’s 
pain 
intensity. 


2.2. 
Discharge 
criteria 
The 
study 
patients 
were 
discharged 
according 
to 
the 
criteria 
listed 
in 
Table 
4, 
after 
having 
been 
examined 
by 
the 
ENT 
staff. 
Children 
after 
adenoidectomy 
were 
usually 
discharged 
the 
day 
after 
surgery 
and 
adenotonsillectomy 
patients 
2 
days 
postoperatively.

Duration 
of 
hospital 
stay 
Following 
the 
current 
concept 
of 
postoperative 
care 
(inpatient 
treatment), 
the 
average 
length 
of 
hospital 
stay 
was 
2.4 
days 
for 
all 
114 
patients, 
for 
adenoidectomy 
(A) 
children 
1.5 
days, 
for 
adenotonsillectomy 
(T&A) 
patients 
3.1 
days. 


3.2. 
Postoperati6e 
sequelae 
The 
most 
frequent 
postoperative 
sequela 
was 
fever 
(21 
out 
of 
114; 
18%). 
Comparing 
the 
amount 
of 
fever 
episodes 
after 
T&A 
(16 
out 
of 
63 
patients; 
25%) 
to 
the 
ones 
after 
A 
(four 
out 
of 
51 
patients; 
8%), 
there 
was 
a 
significant 
difference 
found 
regardless 
of 
age 
(P*0.01). 
No 
signifi


cance 
was 
apparent 
in 
the 
age 
comparison 
regardless 
of 
surgery 
type. 


Protracted 
vomiting 
was 
neither 
significantly 
different 
(P*0.26) 
between 
A 
(four 
of 
51; 
8%) 
and 
T&A 
(10 
of 
63; 
16%) 
nor 
between 
their 
age 
categories 
(P*0.35). 
None 
of 
the 
10 
children 
who 
vomited 
more 
than 
twice 
in 
24 
h 
after 
T&A 
were 
under 
3 
years 
of 
age, 
thus 
showing 
a 
statistical 
tendency 
(P*0.099) 
that 
older 
children 
were 
more 
prone 
to 
protracted 
vomiting 
after 
surgery 
than 
the 
younger 
ones 
after 
T&A 
(Table 
5). 


Because 
of 
the 
relatively 
small 
number 
of 
patients 
in 
this 
study, 
only 
two 
age 
categories 
(3 
years 
and 
older:less 
than 
3 
years 
of 
age) 
were 
chosen. 
The 
trend 
for 
higher 
postoperative 
sequelae 
rates 
with 
increasing 
age 
was 
not 
statistically 
significant 
(P*\0.99). 


There 
was 
no 
significant 
difference 
between 
the 
postoperative 
sequelae 
of 
male 
(16 
out 
of 
62; 
26%) 
and 
female 
(17 
out 
of 
52; 
33%) 
patients 
(P*0.53). 


3.3. 
Indications 
for 
surgery 
The 
postoperative 
sequelae 
in 
31 
children 
with 
recurrent 
AOM 
and:or 
recurrent 
tonsillitis 
demanded 
additional 
care 
in 
eight 
patients 
(26%), 
tendencially 
more 
after 
T&A 
(six 
of 
14; 
43%) 
than 
after 
adenoidectomy 
(two 
of 
17; 
12%) 
(P*= 
0.097). 
Of 
the 
52 
patients 
with 
both 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
and 
recurrent 
AOM 
and:or 
recurrent 
tonsillitis 
15 
(29%) 
could 
not 
have 
been 
discharged 
after 
8 
h 
postoperatively. 
Here, 
the 
difference 
of 
the 
sequelae 
rate 
after 
T&A 
(43%) 
and 
A 
(9%) 
was 
significant 
(P*0.01). 


Fourteen 
of 
all 
investigated 
patients 
suffered 
from 
mild 
obstructive 
symptoms 
of 
the 
upper 
respiratory 
tract. 
Only 
one 
patient 
(7%) 
needed 
additional 
care 
after 
A. 
Three 
out 
of 
nine 
with 
severe 
airway 
obstruction 
suffered 
from 
postoperative 
sequelae 
8 
h 
after 
surgery. 


Eight 
patients 
had 
severe 
airway 
obstruction 
and 
recurrent 
AOM 
and:or 
recurrent 
tonsillitis. 
Six 
(75%) 
children 
out 
of 
this 
group 
were 
prone 
to 
postoperative 
problems 
and 
needed 
additional 
care: 
one 
after 
adenoidectomy 
and 
five 
after 
T&A 
(Table 
6).

3.4. 
Complications 
After 
adenoidectomy, 
two 
patients 
with 
severe 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
suffered 
from 
either 
a 
local 
infection 
with 
persistent 
fever 
(\38°C) 
and 
protracted 
emesis 
or 
had 
an 
apnea 
episode 
requiring 
additional 
treatment. 


After 
adenotonsillectomy, 
one 
child 
was 
taken 
to 
the 
intensive 
care 
unit 
directly 
after 
surgery 
because 
of 
an 
apnea 
immediately 
after 
extubation, 
another 
patient 
developed 
a 
pneumonia 
and 
one 
boy 
developed 
an 
edema 
of 
the 
tongue 
and 
was 
treated 
with 
a 
single 
dose 
of 
corticosteroids 
intravenously. 
Local 
infection 
with 
fever 
and 
protracted 
emesis 
in 
need 
of 
i.v. 
antibiotic 
treatment 
occurred 
in 
two 
children 
after 
T&A. 


3.4.1. 
Postoperati6e 
hemorrhage 
Of 
all 
the 
patients 
reviewed 
in 
this 
study, 
not 
one 
suffered 
from 
primary 
hemorrhage. 
Second 
hemorrhage 
occurred 
in 
only 
one 
patient 
because 
of 
a 
previously 
undetected 
thrombocyte 
dysfunction. 


4. 
Discussion 
Searching 
through 
the 
literature 
on 
adenoidectomy 
(A) 
and:or 
adenotonsillectomy 
(T&A) 
on 
an 
outpatient 
basis, 
most 
articles 
stressed 
hemorrhage 
as 
the 
main 
postoperative 
‘problem’ 
after 
T&A 
and 
A 
in 
children 
[7–10]. 
According 
to 
our 


Table 
6 
Indication 
for 
surgery 
and 
possibility 
of 
discharge 
after 
8 
h 
(N

definitions, 
hemorrhage 
has 
to 
be 
considered 
as 
a 
complication, 
whereas 
in 
our 
opinion 
the 
assessment 
of 
both 
complications 
and 
sequelae 
have 
to 
be 
taken 
into 
account 
to 
discuss 
whether 
tonsillectomy 
and:or 
adenoidectomy 
in 
children 
can 
be 
done 
as 
an 
outpatient 
procedure 
(i.e. 
same 
day 
discharge). 
Our 
patients’ 
range 
consists 
exclusively 
of 
children, 
in 
which 
fluid 
depletion 
due 
to 
recurrent 
emesis, 
poor 
oral 
intake 
and 
fever 
are 
much 
more 
hazardous 
than 
in 
adults, 
who 
have 
less 
limited 
reserves 
[11,12]. 


4.1. 
Eight-hour 
postoperati6e 
obser6ation 
period 
To 
discharge 
a 
patient 
on 
the 
same 
day, 
a 
minimum 
of 
8 
h 
was 
chosen 
as 
proposed 
by 
several 
authors 
[3,8–10] 
to 
allow 
sufficient 
recuperation 
time 
after 
surgery. 


4.2. 
Interpretation 
of 
results 
The 
total 
postoperative 
sequelae 
and 
complication 
rate 
was 
29%, 
which 
seems 
to 
be 
considerably 
higher 
than 
in 
most 
studies 
on 
T&A 
or 
A. 
The 
reason 
for 
this 
phenomenon 
is 
most 
probably 
the 
lack 
of 
standardization 
and 
definition 
of 
different 
sequelae 
and:or 
complications 
among 
the 
studies. 
After 
the 
discharge, 
however, 
it 
is 
up 
to 
the 
parents 
to 
take 
over 
the 
management 
of 
any 
occurring 
sequela 
(e.g. 
administration 
of 
antiemetics, 
analgesics, 
etc.), 
which 
can 
lead 
either 
to 
unnecessary 
visits 
to 
the 
emergency 
room 
or 
endanger 
the 
patient’s 
life.

Using 
the 
postoperative 
‘complication 
rate’ 
of 
other 
studies 
like 
the 
trial 
of 
Carithers 
et 
al. 
[3], 
who 
took 
only 
hemorrhage 
and 
emesis 
into 
account, 
we 
considered 
15% 
of 
postoperative 
complications 
(and 
sequelae) 
within 
8 
h 
after 
surgery 
as 
the 
maximum 
risk 
acceptable 
for 
our 
patients 
and 
a 
criterion 
for 
discharge. 


Summarizing 
the 
postoperative 
sequelae, 
our 
data 
show 
that 
after 
A, 
there 
were 
significantly 
less 
problems 
during 
the 
first 
8 
h 
after 
surgery 
as 
compared 
to 
after 
T&A. 
This 
is 
also 
the 
cumulative 
experience 
of 
several 
reports 
on 
T&A 
reviewed 
by 
Tewary 
et 
al. 
[13], 
Watson 
et 
al. 
[14] 
and 
Yardley 
[9]. 
In 
the 
studies 
of 
Reiner 
et 
al. 
[15] 
and 
Segal 
et 
al. 
[16], 
there 
was 
not 
even 
one 
complication 
after 
A. 
According 
to 
our 
study, 
A 
for 
mild 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
can 
be 
performed 
on 
an 
outpatient 
basis 
regardless 
of 
age. 


Even 
though 
the 
total 
number 
of 
tonsillectomies 
has 
declined, 
the 
percentage 
undergone 
for 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
has 
generally 
increased 
[2]. 
Our 
survey 
was 
able 
to 
demonstrate 
that 
children 
with 
severe 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
also 
suffer 
from 
significantly 
more 
postoperative 
sequelae 
than 
patients 
who 
are 
admitted 
for 
surgery 
because 
of 
mild 
obstruction 
and:or 
recurrent 
infections. 


Other 
authors 
[17–20] 
support 
close 
overnight 
observation, 
preferably 
in 
a 
care 
unit 
with 
continuous 
pulse 
oxymetry, 
mandated 
by 
the 
exceptionally 
frequent 
postoperative 
complications 
in 
this 
group. 


The 
age 
of 
the 
patient 
is 
of 
no 
great 
importance, 
our 
study 
shows 
that 
children 
under 
3 
years 
of 
age 
do 
not 
have 
significantly 
higher 
complication 
rates 
compared 
to 
the 
older 
ones. 
There 
was 
a 
tendency 
discovered 
that 
children 
aged 
three 
and 
older, 
after 
T&A, 
suffered 
from 
episodes 
of 
protracted 
emesis 
more 
frequently 
than 
patients 
under 
3 
years 
of 
age 
(P*0,0997), 
which 
correlates 
with 
the 
finding 
of 
other 
investigators 
[15]. 
Various 
other 
authors 
such 
as 
Rothschild 
et 
al. 


[18] 
state 
that 
patients 
3 
years 
old 
and 
younger 
seem 
to 
be 
at 
increased 
risk 
for 
delayed 
adequate 
oral 
intake. 
In 
addition, 
it 
depends 
on 
the 
proportional 
blood 
loss, 
whether 
delayed 
oral 
intake 
can 
even 
endanger 
the 
patients 
life. 
Tom 
et 
al. 
[20] 
consider 
patients 
under 
3 
years 
are 
inappropriate 
candidates 
for 
outpatient 
surgery. 
However, 
they 
did 
not 
compare 
these 
results 
with 
a 
control 
group 
of 
children 
aged 
3 
years 
or 
older. 


Of 
interest 
is 
also 
the 
tendencially 
higher 
amount 
of 
patients 
with 
protracted 
emesis 
after 
T&A 
who 
were 
three 
and 
older 
as 
compared 
with 
the 
children 
younger 
than 
3 
years 
(P*0.0997). 
The 
high 
emesis 
rates 
and 
amount 
of 
i.v. 
fluid 
treatment 
show 
that 
dehydration 
and 
poor 
oral 
intake 
are 
significant 
postoperative 
sequelae, 
differing 
from 
Haberkern 
et 
al. 
[21] 
and 
Reiner 
et 
al. 
[15]. 


Persistent 
postoperative 
fe6er 
usually 
caused 
by 
dehydration, 
was 
considered 
to 
be 
dependent 
on 
the 
type 
of 
surgery 
(A 
or 
T&A), 
since 
the 
Fischer’s 
exact 
test 
showed 
a 
significantly 
higher 
postoperative 
fever 
rate 
after 
T&A 
(P*0.01). 


Hemorrhage 
not 
having 
occurred 
primarily 
(0%) 
at 
all 
and 
only 
twice 
secondarily 
(2%) 
was 
a 
postoperative 
complication 
with 
an 
incidence 
as 
in 
other 
surveys 
[3,14,22,23]. 


Results 
of 
various 
studies 
on 
pain 
management 
in 
children 
[11,21,24–27] 
imply 
that 
in 
general, 
nurses 
and 
parents 
underestimate 
the 
children’s 
pain; 
thus 
pain 
assessment 
and 
control 
remain 
crucial 
and 
difficult 
[24]. 


5. 
Conclusions 
In 
this 
study, 
114 
patients 
after 
A 
and 
T&A 
were 
assessed 
and 
tendencies 
for 
the 
future 
management 
of 
these 
surgery 
types 
were 
elaborated. 
However, 
the 
number 
of 
children 
in 
our 
study 
population 
is 
too 
small 
to 
be 
used 
for 
a 
general 
recommendation 
and 
therefore 
further 
studies 
are 
necessary. 


Nonetheless, 
we 
propose 
adenoidectomy 
being 
done 
as 
a 
same 
day 
discharge 
procedure 
except 
for 
those 
patients 
with 
underlying 
pathologies 
listed 
in 
the 
exclusion 
criteria 
and 
children 
with 
severe 
obstructive 
airway 
symptoms. 
Surgery 
of 
the 
tonsils 
generally 
causes 
significantly 
more 
postoperative 
sequelae 
than 
adenoidectomy, 
although 
some 
children 
in 
our 
study 
(59%) 
fulfilled 
discharge 
criteria 
after 
T&A, 
and 
same 
day 
discharge 
would 
have 
been 
possible, 
too.

Thus, 
it 
still 
remains 
in 
the 
surgeons’ 
hands 
to 
check 
and 
balance 
the 
child’s 
condition 
pre-and 
postoperatively 
and 
decide 
when 
a 
patient 
can 
be 
discharged 
safely.
