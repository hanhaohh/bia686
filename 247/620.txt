Objective: 
To 
assess 
the 
efficacy 
of 
adenotonsillar 
surgery 
on 
respiratory 
sleep 
parameters 
and 
avoiding 
continuous 
positive 
airway 
pressure 
(CPAP) 
treatment 
in 
morbidly 
obese 
children 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
syndrome 
(OSAS). 


Design: 
Retrospective. 


Setting: 
Tertiary 
referral 
institution. 


Patients: 
Children 
aged 
2 
to 
18 
years, 
with 
a 
body 
mass 
index 
(BMI) 
at 
or 
higher 
than 
the 
95th 
percentile 
(adjusted 
forageandsex),undergoingadenotonsillarsurgeryforOSAS. 


Interventions: 
Adenotonsillectomy. 


Main 
Outcome 
Measures: 
Preoperative 
and 
postoperative 
respiratory 
disturbance 
index, 
oxygen 
saturation 
nadir, 
overall 
severity 
of 
OSAS 
(mild, 
moderate, 
or 
severe) 
and 
candidacy 
for 
CPAP 
treatment 
were 
assessed 
and 
compared. 
Variables 
such 
as 
age, 
severity 
of 
disease, 
adenotonsillar 
size, 
and 
BMI 
z 
scores 
were 
compared 
between 
responders 
and 
nonresponders 
to 
surgical 
treatment. 


Results: 
A 
total 
of 
19 
patients 
with 
full 
preoperative 
and 
postoperative 
data 
for 
evaluation 
were 
identified. 
The 
median 
(SD) 
age 
was 
78 
months 
(53.3 
months). 
The 
median 
(SD) 
BMI 
z 
score 
was 
2.84 
(0.94). 
Eighteen 
patients 
(95%) 
had 
OSAS 
preoperatively 
to 
warrant 
CPAP 
treatment. 
Surgery 
reduced 
the 
overall 
median 
(SD) 
respiratory 
disturbance 
index 
from 
20.7 
(24.5) 
to 
7.3 
(14.9) 
(P.001) 
and 
improved 
the 
median 
(SD) 
oxygen 
saturation 
nadir 
from 
77.5% 
(16.3%) 
to 
88.5 
(13.1%) 
(P.01). 
A 
total 
of 
7 
patients 
(37%) 
were 
cured 
by 
surgery. 
Ten 
patients 
(53%) 
had 
postoperative 
disease 
of 
sufficient 
severity 
to 
require 
CPAP. 
Surgery 
obviated 
the 
need 
for 
further 
treatment 
in 
only 
8 
(44%) 
of 
the 
18 
patients 
with 
preoperative 
disease 
warranting 
CPAP. 
No 
differences 
were 
identified 
between 
responders 
and 
nonresponders 
to 
surgical 
treatment. 


Conclusions: 
Adenotonsillar 
surgery 
improves 
sleep 
respiratory 
parameters 
in 
morbidly 
obese 
children 
with 
OSAS. 
Most 
patients 
have 
residual 
OSAS 
requiring 
further 
treatment.

BSTRUCTIVE 
SLEEP 
APNEA 
syndrome 
(OSAS) 
is 
an 
increasingly 
recognized 
disease 
entity 
in 
childhood, 
affecting 
2% 
of 
the 
pediatric 
population.1 
Most 
cases 
result 
from 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy 
and 
are 
thus 
amenable 
to 
surgical 
cure.2 
It 
now 
represents 
the 
most 
common 
indication 
for 
pediatric 
adenotonsillectomy.3 
In 
Western 
populations, 
childhood 
morbid 
obesity 
has 
risen 
dramatically 
over 
the 
past 
2 
decades.
4,5 
This 
increase 
has 
significant 
implications 
for 
the 
otolaryngologist 
because 
OSAS 
is 
reported 
to 
occur 
in 
37% 
to 
46% 
of 
morbidly 
obese 
children.6,7 
This 
suggests 
that 
morbid 
obesity 
has 
a 
major 
role 


in 
the 
pathogenesis 
of 
OSAS 
in 
this 
subgroup. 
Notwithstanding 
this, 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy 
may 
also 
be 
present 
in 
these 
patients. 
The 
relative 
contribution 
each 
of 
these 
entities—morbid 
obesity 
and 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy—to 
resultant 
OSAS 
in 
these 
children 
is 
not 
clear.8 
The 
obvious 
implication 
is 
that 
adenotonsillectomy 
will 
be 
increasingly 
performed 
on 
morbidly 
obese 
children. 


To 
our 
knowledge, 
there 
are 
only 
a 
handful 
of 
publications 
in 
the 
literature 
addressing 
the 
effect 
of 
surgery 
on 
OSAS 
in 
morbidly 
obese 
children, 
and 
none 
have 
specifically 
addressed 
the 
need 
for 
further 
treatment 
after 
surgery.

of

who 
underwent 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSAS 
over 
a 
36-month 
period. 
Only

and 
more 
than 
3 
months 
of 
postoperative 
follow-up, 
including 
PSG 
where 
appropriate, 
were 
included. 


Demographic 
data 
recorded 
included 
age, 
sex, 
height, 
weight, 
and 
BMI. 
A 
BMI 
z 
score 
was 
calculated 
for 
each 
patient 
to 
facilitate 
comparative 
analysis. 
Tonsil 
size 
was 
graded 
on 
a 
4-point 
scale. 
Grade 
1 
tonsils 
were 
those 
lying 
lateral 
to 
the 
tonsillar 
fauces; 
grade 
2, 
at 
the 
level 
of 
the 
fauces; 
grade 
3, 
medial 
to 
the 
fauces 
but 
not 
to 
midline; 
and 
grade 
4, 
touching 
at 
the 
midline. 
Adenoidal 
grading 
was 
on 
a 
4-point 
scale: 
0, 
absent; 
1, 
minimal 
adenoidal 
tissue; 
2, 
moderate 
hypertrophy; 
and 
3, 
obstructing 
the 
choanae, 
as 
assessed 
at 
the 
time 
of 
operation. 


Preoperative 
and 
postoperative 
overnight 
sleep 
study 
data 
were 
recorded. 


Overnight 
sleep 
studies 
included 
full 
overnight 
PSG 
or 
overnight 
sleep 
oximetry. 
The 
PSG 
was 
performed 
by 
measuring 
the 
following 
standard 
neurophysiologic 
and 
respiratory 
signals 
(Com


pumedics 
Sleep 
Pty 
Ltd, 
E-series, 
Abbotsford, 
Australia): 
electroencephalogram 
with 
central, 
anterior, 
and 
occipital 
leads; 
electro-
oculograms; 
submental 
and 
diaphragmatic 
electromyogram 
using 
external 
electrodes; 
and 
heart 
rate 
and 
rhythm 
recorded 
by 
electrocardiogram. 
Airflow 
was 
recorded 
using 
a 
nasobuccal 
thermistor. 
Nasal 
pressure 
was 
measured 
using 
a 
nasal 
cannula 
connected 
to 
a 
pressure 
transducer. 
Chest 
wall 
excursion 
was 
measured 
by 
respiratory 
inductive 
plethysmography 
(Respitrace 
PT, 
model 
105-042-01; 
NIMS 
Inc, 
Miami 
Beach, 
Fla). 
Oxygen 
saturation 
was 
measured 
by 
pulse 
oximetry 
set 
at 
a 
2-second 
averaging 
time 
(Nellcor, 
Hayward, 
Calif). 
Body 
position 
was 
noted, 
and 
digital 
videotapes 
were 
taken. 
The 
following 
PSG 
results 
were 
recorded: 
respiratory 
disturbance 
index 
(RDI), 
defined 
as 
the 
sum 
of 
obstructive 
apneas 
and 
hypopneas 
per 
hour 
of 
sleep, 
and 
the 
oxygen 
saturation 
nadir, 
the 
lowest 
percentage 
of 
oxygen 
saturation 
recorded 
during 
sleep 
study. 
An 
RDI 
of 
more 
than 
5 
and 
less 
than 
10 
was 
considered 
mild 
OSAS; 
at 
least 
10 
but 
less 
than 
20, 
moderate 
OSAS; 
and 
20 
or 
higher, 
severe 
disease. 
All 
sleep 
studies 
were 
evaluated 
by 
a 
pediatric 
sleep 
physician 
(A.W.). 
The 
presence 
of 
preoperative 
disease 
of 
sufficient 
severity 
to 
warrant 
treatment 
with 
continuous 
positive 
airway 
pressure 
(CPAP) 
was 
evaluated 
and 
assigned 
by 
the 
pediatric 
sleep 
physician. 


The 
follow-up 
evaluation 
for 
each 
patient 
was 
assessed 
with 
regard 
to 
polysomnographic 
parameters 
recorded 
during 
the 
overnight 
sleep 
study, 
and 
the 
outcome 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
need 
for 
CPAP 
therapy 
was 
noted. 


Paired 
data 
were 
analyzed 
using 
2-tailed 
paired 
t 
test. 
Other 
statistical 
analysis 
was 
performed 
using 
the 
Mann-Whitney 
test 
and 
Fisher 
exact 
test. 
A 
P 
value 
of 
less 
than

RESULTS
A 
total 
of 
26 
morbidly 
obese 
patients 
were 
identified 
who 
underwent 
adenotonsillar 
surgery 
as 
the 
primary 
procedure 
over 
a 
36-month 
period; 
of 
these, 
20 
had 
sleepstudy–
documented 
OSAS. 
Of 
these 
20, 
19 
had 
preoperative 
and 
postoperative 
data 
available 
for 
analysis 
and 
were 
included 
in 
this 
study. 
All 
patients 
had 
a 
full 
preoperative 
respiratory 
and 
sleep 
physician 
evaluation, 
and 
none 
had 
a 
comorbid 
diagnosis 
of 
significant 
pulmonary 
disease. 
The 
cohort 
included 
2 
patients 
with 
named 
syndromes: 
1 
with 
Albright 
osteodystrophy 
and 
1 
with 
Down 
syndrome. 


Fourteen 
patients 
were 
boys, 
and 
5 
were 
girls. 
The 
Figure 
represents 
the 
demographical 
data 
for 
the 
patient 
cohort, 
plotting 
age 
against 
BMI 
on 
sex-specific 
percentile 
charts. 
The 
median 
age 
(SD) 
was 
78 
(53.3) 
months 
(range, 
24-212 
months). 
The 
median 
(SD) 
BMI 
z 
score 
was 
2.84 
(0.94) 
(range, 
2.02-5.28). 
Median 
tonsillar 
and 
adenoidal 
size 
were 
grades 
3 
and 
2, 
respectively. 


All 
19 
patients 
had 
overnight 
sleep 
studies 
preoperatively, 
either 
full 
overnight 
PSG 
(n=18) 
or 
overnight 
sleep 
oximetry 
alone 
(n=1). 
Median 
(SD) 
preoperative 
RDI 
was 
22.0 
(33.5) 
(range, 
7.6-129.2). 
The 
median 
(SD) 
oxygen 
saturation 
nadir 
measured 
during 
sleep 
was 
75.0% 
(15.9%) 
(range, 
22%-92%). 
Preoperative 
disease 
severity 
was 
judged 
to 
be 
severe 
in 
10 
patients 
(53%), 
moderate 
in 
8 
(42%), 
and 
mild 
in 
1 
(5%). 
Based 
on 
the 
preoperative 
severity 
of 
disease, 
18 
patients 
(95%) 
were 
considered 
candidates 
for 
CPAP. 


Seventeen 
patients 
had 
undergone 
adenotonsillectomy, 
1 
(an 
older 
patient 
with 
bulky 
uvular 
tissue) 
also 
had 
undergone 
a 
modified 
uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, 
and 
another 
had 
undergone 
only 
tonsillectomy, 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
adenoidal 
tissue 
for 
resection. 
All 
were 
clinically 
assessed 
no 
sooner 
than 
6 
weeks 
postoperatively. 
One 
patient 
had 
full 
resolution 
of 
all 
symptoms, 
including 
snoring. 
Although 
a 
follow-up 
sleep 
study 
had 
been 
planned, 
the 
patient’s 
parent 
refused 
to 
participate 
because 
full 
symptomatic 
resolution, 
including 
that 
of 
snoring, 
had 
occurred 
postoperatively. 
In 
view 
of 
the 
absence 
of 
snoring 
and 
associated 
preoperative 
symptoms, 
this 
patient 
was 
considered 
cured. 
The 
remaining 
18 
patients 
had 
full 
overnight 
PSG 
at 
a 
mean 
13-week 
interval 
after 
surgery 
(range, 
8-30 
weeks). 
Paired 
preoperative 
and 
posttreatment 
PSG 
data 
were 
available 
for 
these 
patients. 
The 
median

OSAS 
(n=2). 
The 
disease 
severity 
of 
6 
patients 
was 
on 
follow-
up 
PSG, 
and 
1 
patient’s 
OSAS 
was 
up-staged 
from 
moderate 
to 
severe. 
Ten 
patients 
(53%) 
were 
found 
to 
have 
residual 
disease 
of 
sufficient 
severity 
to 
warrant 
further 
treatment 
in 
the 
form 
of 
CPAP 
therapy. 
This 
was 
tolerated 
well 
in 
all 
patients. 
Of 
the 
19 
patients 
who 
underwent 
surgery, 
18 
(95%) 
had 
initial 
disease 
of 
sufficient 
severity 
to 
warrant 
CPAP 
therapy. 
Of 
this 
group 
(n=18), 
10 
(56%) 
ultimately 
required 
this 
treatment, 
with 
8 
(44%) 
improving 
after 
surgery 
to 
a 
degree 
that 
CPAP 
was 
not 
indicated, 
either 
by 
cure 
or 
by 
mild

(Table

COMMENTCOMMENT
This 
study 
confirms 
the 
overall 
positive 
effect 
of 
surgery 
on 
respiratory 
parameters 
during 
sleep, 
namely, 
RDI 
and 
oxygen 
saturation 
nadir. 
Mitchell 
and 
Kelly9 
recently 
reported 
similar 
findings 
in 
a 
prospective 
study 
of 
30 
morbidly 
obese 
children 
with 
a 
diagnosis 
of 
OSAS 
proved 
by 
polysomnography.10 
Other 
reports10,11 
have 
also 
observed 
a 
beneficial 
result 
following 
surgery, 
but 
only 
Weit 
et 
al10 
had 
PSG 
documentation 
of 
disease 
and 
resolution 
in 
a 
pediatric 
population 
that 
was 
morbidly 
obese. 
Mitchell 
and 
Kelly9 
also 
noted 
the 
high 
prevalence 
of 
residual 
disease 
in 
their 
study 
population, 
with 
36% 
of 
children 
having 
moderate 
or 
severe 
disease. 
Although 
the 
current 
study 
was 
retrospective 
and 
had 
a 
smaller 
cohort, 
a 
higher 
prevalence 
of 
significant 
residual 
disease 
was 
identified 
(56%). 
One 
of 
the 
difficulties 
that 
exists 
in 
relation 
to 
pediatric 
OSAS 
and 
the 
use 
of 
PSG 
as 
the 
gold 
standard 
diagnostic 
tool 
is 
that 
the 
correlation 
between 
the 
magnitude 
of 
RDI 
and 
oxygen 
saturation 
nadir 
abnormalities 
measured 
during 
PSG 
and 
resultant 
adverse 
sequelae 
of 
OSAS 
has 
not 
been 
established.8 
It 
follows 
that 
improving 
RDI 
and 
oxygen 
saturation 
scores 
is 
of 
uncertain 
clinical 
benefit. 
The 
additive 
risk 
of 
adverse 
outcomes 
with 
increasing 
disease 
stratifications, 
from 
mild 
to 
severe, 
also 
remains 
ill-defined. 
Therefore, 
it 
also 
remains 
unclear 
whether 
regression 
of 
disease 
severity 
without 
a 
cure, 
as 
seen 
in 
26% 
(5 
of 
19) 
of 
this 
study 
population, 
has 
any 
significance 
on 
the 
outcome 
of 
the 
disease 
if 
left 
untreated. 


Notwithstanding 
this, 
few 
would 
argue 
the 
justification 
of 
treating 
pediatric 
OSAS 
when 
diagnosed. 
Most 
often, 
adenotonsillectomy 
represents 
the 
first 
line 
of 
treatment 
for 
pediatric 
OSAS, 
with 
CPAP 
reserved 
for 
patients 
in 
whom 
surgery 
was 
not 
successful 
or 
those 
in 
whom 
surgery 
is 
contraindicated.12 
Therapy 
with 
CPAP 
is 
a 
low-risk, 
well-tolerated 
treatment 
option 
in 
children 
with 
OSAS.13 
However, 
it 
is 
not 
without 
attendant 
problems. 
It 
requires 
expensive 
equipment, 
parental 
training, 
and 
patient 
habituation. 
In 
addition, 
it 
must 
be 
used 
for 
an 
unspecified, 
prolonged 
period 
of 
time 
and 
entails 
multiple 
hospital 
admissions 
for 
dose 
titration 
and 
disease 
surveillance, 
further 
adding 
to 
the 
cost 
burden. 
As 
an 
alternative, 
the 
option 
of 
a 
one-time 
surgical 
procedure—adenotonsillectomy—is 
indeed 
an 
attractive 
option. 
In 
the 
study 
group, 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
preoperative 
disease 
severity, 
18 
patients 
were 
candidates 
for 
CPAP. 
Subjecting 
this 
cohort 
to 
surgery 
obviated 
the 
need 
for 
further 
treatment 
in 
only 
8 
(44%) 
of 
18 
patients. 
Ten 
patients 
(56%) 
had 
surgery 
that 
improved 
individual 
respiratory 
sleep 
parameters 
overall 
and 
even 
disease 
stratification 
in 
some 
but 
did 
not 
alter 
the 
outcome 
in 
terms 
of 
avoiding 
CPAP. 
To 
the 
best 
of 
our 
knowledge, 
this 
is 
the 
first 
report 
to 
highlight 
the 
failure 
of 
surgery 
to 
avoid 
CPAP 
in 
morbidly 
obese 
children 
with 
significant 
OSAS. 


Nonetheless, 
in 
the 
combined 
results 
of 
Mitchell 
and 
Kelly9 
and 
the 
results 
presented 
herein 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
effect 
of 
surgery 
on 
disease 
categories, 
57% 
of 
children 
had 
either 
a 
cure 
or 
residual 
mild 
disease 
following 
surgery. 
Surgery 
is 
effective 
in 
some 


morbidly 
obese 
children 
and 
not 
in 
others. 
Possible 
variables 
that 
may 
influence 
the 
efficacy 
of 
surgery 
include 
age, 
BMI 
z 
score, 
severity 
of 
preoperative 
disease, 
and 
size 
of 
the 
adenotonsillar 
tissue. 
None 
of 
these 
preoperative 
factors 
were 
significantly 
different 
between 
the 
group 
that 
received 
postoperative 
CPAP 
and 
the 
group 
that 
received 
no 
further 
treatment 
in 
the 
current 
study, 
although 
the 
small 
numbers 
preclude 
any 
firm 
conclusions 
being 
drawn. 
In 
the 
absence 
of 
preoperative 
variables 
predictive 
of 
a 
positive 
surgical 
outcome, 
surgery 
may 
well 
be 
offered 
to 
all 
morbidly 
obese 
children 
with 
significant 
OSAS 
in 
the 
knowledge 
that 
this 
approach 
will 
avoid 
the 
need 
for 
CPAP 
in 
half 
of 
them. 
However, 
this 
requires 
justification 
by 
risk-and 
cost-benefit 
analyses 
to 
confirm 
primarily 
the 
safety 
and 
secondarily 
the 
economic 
validity 
of 
this 
approach.8 
The 
former 
is 
of 
particular 
concern 
considering 
the 
higher 
risk 
of 
postoperative 
respiratory 
complications 
in 
children 
undergoing 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSAS.14-16 
The 
risks 
specific 
to 
the 
morbidly 
obese 
subgroup 
have 
not 
been 
clarified.8 


Adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSAS 
in 
morbidly 
obese 
children 
improves 
RDI 
and 
oxygen 
saturation 
nadir. 
Fewer 
than 
half 
of 
these 
children 
are 
cured 
by 
surgery. 
Similarly, 
only 
44% 
of 
those 
patients 
with 
preoperative 
OSAS 
severe 
enough 
to 
warrant 
CPAP 
are 
ultimately 
spared 
this 
intervention 
by 
undergoing 
surgery. 
No 
preoperative 
variables 
predictive 
of 
responders 
and 
nonresponders 
to 
surgery 
have 
been 
identified. 
Further 
studies 
evaluating 
the 
risk-benefit 
and 
cost-benefit 
equations 
of 
performing 
adenotonsillectomy 
in 
morbidly 
obese 
children 
will 
clarify 
the 
appropriateness 
of 
offering 
surgery 
to 
all 
patients 
in 
this 
group 
as 
first-line 
treatment.
