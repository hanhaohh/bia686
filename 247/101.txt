Study Objectives: Children with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) or 
periodic leg movements during sleep (PLMS) often have hyperactive 
behavior that improves when the sleep disorder is treated. Some children 
with SDB also have PLMS. To determine what polysomnographic features 
of SDB might be associated with hyperactive behavior, we studied 
behavior, SDB, and PLMS in a series of patients. 
Design: Prospective and observational 
Setting: University-based sleep disorders laboratory 
Subjects: Children (n=113) aged 2 to 18 years, referred for suspected 
SDB 
Interventions: Parents completed the hyperactivity index of the Connors’ 
Parental Rating Scale, and results were converted to age-adjusted t-
scores. Children underwent laboratory-based polysomnography, with 
esophageal pressure monitoring when requested (n=19) by referring 
physicians. 
Results: Children with SDB (n=59) showed high hyperactivity scores 
(mean 59.5±18.3 SD, 95% C.I. [54.7, 64.2]) but these scores were no 

INTRODUCTION 

CHILDREN WITH OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP-DISORDERED 
BREATHING (SDB), IN THE FORM OF OBSTRUCTIVE 
SLEEP APNEA OR UPPER AIRWAY RESISTANCE SYNDROME, 
are reported to have inattentive, hyperactive, and 
aggressive behavior.1-3 Some pediatric patients arrive at sleep 
centers already diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD) and treated with methylphenidate; once SDB 
is diagnosed and treated, behavior improves and stimulants 
sometimes can be discontinued.2,4,5 The frequency with which 
ADHD and SDB occur together, in the community, remains 
unknown, but ADHD affects more than 5% of children,6 undiagnosed 
SDB affects at least 1% to 3%,7,8 and surveys about symptoms 
of the two conditions suggest that the comorbidity may be 
relevant to a substantial minority of children with hyperactive 
behavior.9 

The mechanism by which SDB may contribute to hyperactive 
behavior is unknown. Children deprived of sufficient amounts of 
sleep or adequate quality of sleep may fidget, spring out of 
chairs, shift attention, and create excitement in an effort to 
remain awake and learn. Sleep disruption is implicated as a 
cause of hyperactivity in SDB by observations that other sleep 
disorders, such as periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD)10-12

higher than those of children without SDB (59.0±15.1, [54.8, 63.1]). 
Hyperactivity showed no significant associations with the rate of apneas 
and hypopneas, minimum oxygen saturation, or most negative 
esophageal pressure (p>0.10), but was associated with the presence of 5 
or more PLMS per hour (p=0.02). The rate of PLMS showed a linear 
association with hyperactivity among those subjects with SDB (p = 0.002), 
but no association among those subjects without SDB (p = 0.64). 
Conclusions: These findings suggest that hyperactive behavior is common 
among children referred for suspected SDB, regardless of the presence 
or severity of SDB. Current observations cannot prove causality, but 
they are consistent with the hypothesis that PLMS may contribute to 
hyperactivity and SDB may act as an effect modifier. 
Key words: Sleep-disordered breathing; obstructive sleep apnea; upper 
airway resistance syndrome; polysomnography; hyperactivity; attentiondeficit/
hyperactivity disorder; ADHD; periodic leg movements; periodic 
limb movement disorder; children 

and narcolepsy,13,14 also are associated with hyperactive behavior. 
As in SDB, treatment of PLMD or narcolepsy often leads to 
behavioral improvement.15,16 In contrast to children, adults with 
SDB most often complain of excessive daytime sleepiness.17 
Once again, however, the mechanism by which SDB causes daytime 
symptoms is unclear: both hypoxemia and the frequency of 
apneic events—presumably a reflection of the severity of sleep 
disruption—are independently associated with objective measures 
of sleepiness, but the magnitudes of these associations are 
not large.18 Analogous studies in children, to compare behavioral 
outcomes with polysomnographic measures of SDB, have not 
been performed. 

Finally, the argument that SDB actually causes hyperactive 
behavior in children, by any mechanism, remains far from 
proven. Few studies have used validated behavioral measures to 
document largely anecdotal observations. Clinical series have 
not included behavioral data on children referred to sleep centers 
but not found to have SDB. Hyperactive children may be 
referred for sleep studies more frequently than others because 
they frequently have disturbed sleep.19-22 No double-blind, single-
blind, placebo controlled, or randomized treatment trials 
have documented improvement in hyperactivity as a result of 
treatment for SDB. 

If SDB does cause hyperactivity in children, an association 
between levels of hyperactivity and polysomnographic measures 
of SDB would be expected. We used the well-validated hyperactivity 
index of the Connors’ Parental Rating Scale23,24 to assess 
hyperactivity in a series of children evaluated for suspected SDB, 
and then examined what polysomnographic measures of SDB 
were most closely and independently associated with hyperactiv-

ity. As PLMD is common in SDB, at least among adults, we also 
tested for associations between the frequency of periodic leg 
movements during sleep and levels of hyperactivity. 

METHODS 

Subjects 

Children were included in this prospective, observational, 
Institutional Review Board-approved study if the parents or 
guardians signed an informed consent, subjects 10 years of age or 
older signed an assent, and subjects met the following criteria: 1) 
referral to our sleep laboratory for a full night of nocturnal 
polysomnography between August 23, 1996 and March 29, 2000 
to assess for suspected SDB; 2) age 2.0 to 18.0 years; 3) hyperactivity 
scale completed by a parent or guardian at the time of 
polysomnography; 4) no tracheostomy normally open during 
sleep; and 5) no concurrent cognitive, physical, or medical disability, 
as reported by the parent on a laboratory questionnaire, 
that would be likely to preclude interpretation of the hyperactivity 
score. The questionnaire included a medical history; list of 
current medications; specific inquiry about any physician-suspected 
or diagnosed psychological, psychiatric, emotional, and 
behavioral problems; and an immediate family history for behavioral 
or psychiatric problems. To avoid creation of a sample with 
little resemblance to that seen in clinical practice, subjects were 
still included if they were diagnosed with sleep disorders other 
than SDB, or with behavioral problems judged unlikely to prevent 
behaviors addressed by the hyperactivity measure described 
below. A total of 113 patients met criteria and were included in 
this study. 

Measures 

Hyperactive behavior was assessed with the hyperactivity 
index of the commonly-used Connors’ Parental Rating Scale.23,24 
Raw scores were converted to age-adjusted t-scores, which range 
from 0 to 100 and average 50 in population samples. Conversion 
was based on standard age-appropriate data from children aged 3 
through 17 years; data for the three to five-year-old group were 
used, as an approximation, for study subjects who were 2.0 to 2.9 
years old. The Connors’ Scale is not used to establish a diagnosis 
of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, but the hyperactivity 
index t-scores provide a widely recognized measure of behavior 
in which either one s.d. above the population mean (score=60) 
or two SD’s (score=70) is used to define an abnormally hyperactive 
group. 

Nocturnal polysomnography included four electroencephalographic 
leads (C3-A2, C4-A1, O1-A2, O2-A1 of the 10-20 international 
electrode placement system), 2 electro-oculographic 
leads (right and left outer canthi), chin and bilateral anterior tibialis 
surface electromyograms, 2 electrocardiographic leads, 
nasal and oral airflow (thermocouples), thoracic and abdominal 
excursion (piezoelectric strain gauges), and finger oximetry. In a 
minority of cases (n=19), and at the referring physician’s request, 
esophageal pressure was monitored with a water-filled catheter25 
that does not have significant adverse effects on children’s 
sleep.26 Sleep stages were scored in 30-second epochs according 
to standard criteria27 by technologists who, after an extensive 
training program, had correctly scored at least 90% of epochs in 

a set of reliability records. 

An apnea was defined as 10 or more seconds of complete airflow 
cessation during sleep, regardless of any change in oxygen 
saturation. An hypopnea was defined as a 10-second reduction in 
airflow, chest excursion, or abdominal excursion that led to either 
a 4% or greater oxyhemoglobin desaturation, an arousal, or an 
awakening. Some pediatric sleep laboratories now score apneas 
or hypopneas that are less than 10 seconds long, in part because 
normal respiratory rates can be considerably higher in young 
children than in adults. However, this justification would not 
apply well to the older children and teenagers included in our 
sample. We suspect that in the current study, esophageal pressure 
monitoring allowed identification of subtle SRBDs in some of 
the younger children for whom shorter apneic event criteria 
might otherwise have been important. 

For this study, we classified subjects as having SDB if they 
had a rate of apneas and hypopneas (apnea/hypopnea index, or 
AHI) that was at least five per hour of sleep, or if their peak negative 
end-inspiratory esophageal pressure was -20 cm of water or 
more negative. These criteria were chosen to provide internally 
uniform limits that would be reasonably applicable to our wide 
range of subject ages, and with the realization that better cutoffs 
are difficult to define at present in the absence of the necessary 
outcome-based, age-stratified studies.28 Although one frequently 
cited study of 50 normal children found an apnea index of 1 or 
more to be unusual,29 this study did not define what rate of apneas 
causes adverse outcomes and did not address the role of hypopneas, 
which at least in adults appear to have outcome-related significance 
comparable to that of apneas.18,30 We chose to include 
hypopneas in our criterion for OSA, and we used an AHI threshold 
of 5 instead of an apnea index of 1. 

Although esophageal pressures in excess of -20 cm of water 
do not define upper airway resistance syndrome, no widely 
accepted alternative definition is available. One frequently referenced 
publication described the syndrome as a combination of 
excessive daytime sleepiness and gradually worsening pressures 
that lead to frequent arousals,31 but published data have not 1) 
defined a minimum required rate of arousals above that seen in 
normal adult sleep,32 2) established a criterion pressure that distinguishes 
abnormal vs. normal pressures, 3) indicated what proportion 
of an abnormal record must exhibit abnormal pressures, 
or 4) established what length of recording, prior to an arousal, 
should exhibit continuously worsening pressures in order to 
attribute the arousal to increased breathing effort. Furthermore, 
some publications33,34 and our own experience have suggested 
that some patients have excessively negative pressures without 
frequent arousals but still experience improvement in symptoms 
after upper airway obstruction is relieved. As a criterion for 
inclusion in the current SDB group when OSA was absent, we 
therefore adopted a simple, objective, but somewhat conservative 
criterion: a minimum esophageal pressure of -20 cm of water.35 
This cut-off level is twice the limit considered to be pathological 
by some researchers.31 

Arousal frequency was not scored in these studies, and 
Multiple Sleep Latency Tests (MSLTs) were not generally administered, 
but surrogate measures for sleep disruption and sleepiness 
were available, namely sleep efficiency (total sleep time 
divided by time in bed) and nocturnal sleep latency. At least 
among adults, the nocturnal sleep latency is the best nocturnal 
correlate of MSLT results.36

and conditions that were described rather than labeled by parents 
(n=18). Neurological problems were reported in 29 children, 
most of whom had seizures (n=15) or headaches (n=5). Family 
histories were notable for ADHD (n=6 relatives of five children) 
and other learning or psychiatric problems (n=10 problems in 
nine relatives). Sixty-one children regularly took medications, 
the most common of which included stimulants (n=20 children), 
antiepileptics (n=15), antidepressants (n=10), neuroleptics (n=3), 
inhalers (n=4), antihistamines (n=6), diuretics (n=4), calcium 
channel blockers (n=3), and beta blockers (n=5). Among the 27 
children with hyperactivity scores more than 2 SDs above normal, 
9 were treated with stimulants and 18 were not. The proportion 
of hyperactive children who were treated with stimulants 
was identical among those with and without SDB (5 of 15 children 
and 4 of 12 children, respectively). Within the hyperactive 
group, nine children with SDB and five children without SDB 
took no stimulant or other psychoactive medication. 

Correlates of Hyperactivity 

The mean hyperactivity index t-score showed a statistically 
significant elevation from normal (50), at 59.2 ± 16.8 (95% C.I. 
[56.1, 62.3]). The mean scores were no different between subjects 
with and without SDB. Hyperactivity scores > 2 SDs above 
population means were somewhat more frequent among SDB 
subjects compared to non-SDB subjects (Table 1), but the difference 
was not statistically significant (.2=0.16, p=0.69). Similar 
results were obtained for a history of attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder and for current stimulant use. 

Regression of hyperactivity scores on AHI, minimum oxygen 
saturation, most negative esophageal pressure, PLMI, sleep efficiency, 
sleep latency, age, or sex showed no significant associations 
except that hyperactivity was associated with male sex (R2 
= 0.049, p = 0.02, Table 2). Regression of hyperactivity scores 
on SDB (presence vs. absence) also showed no significant association. 
Among the 29 children with PLMI =5, PLMI still 
showed no association with hyperactivity (R2 = 0.000, p = 0.690, 
not shown in Table 2). Among these children, 11 (38%) had 
hyperactivity scores more than 2 SDs above normal, whereas 
among the 84 children with PLMI < 5, 16 (19%) had hyperactiv


ity scores in this range. Regression of hyperactivity scores on 
PLMD (PLMI = 5 vs. PLMI < 5) within the entire sample suggested 
that although a linear (“dose-dependent”) relationship 
with PLMI had not been found, the presence of PLMD was associated, 
on average, with an 8-point higher hyperactivity score 
(R2=0.045, p=0.02, Table 2). When male sex was added to the 
model, PLMD was still associated with higher hyperactivity 
scores (Part R2=0.034, p=0.047). For comparison, Table 2 also 
shows the strength of the associations between hyperactivity 
scores and two expected correlates: history of attentiondeficit/
hyperactivity disorder and stimulant use. Controlling for 
stimulant use caused essentially no change in the strengths of the 
associations between hyperactivity and AHI, minimum oxygen 
saturation, most negative esophageal pressure, SDB, PLMI, or 
PLMD. 

To help exclude the possibility that the above analyses failed 
to detect a non-linear association, subjects were categorized 
based on AHI into four groups of similar size, but regression of 
hyperactivity on these categories still failed to reveal a significant 
association. A quadratic model of AHI also showed no significant 
association. Similar negative results were obtained with categorical 
and quadratic models of minimum oxygen saturation 
and esophageal pressure. 

Children With SDB 

Among the 59 children who had SDB, hyperactivity again 
showed no association with AHI, minimum oxygen saturation, 
most negative Pes (n = 15), sleep efficiency, or sleep latency 
(Table 3). However, hyperactivity was significantly associated 
with PLMI, PLMD, older age, and male sex. On average, an 
increase in the PLMI of 1 movement per hour was associated 
with a 1-point increase on the hyperactivity scale T-score 
(R2=0.159, p=0.002), and the presence of PLMD was associated 
with a 13-point increase in the hyperactivity score (R2=0.099, 
p=0.015; Figure 1A). In a multiple regression that adjusted for 
age and male sex, hyperactivity retained a significant association 
with PLMI (Part R2 = 0.098, p = 0.010).

Children Without SDB 

Among the 54 children who did not have SDB, hyperactivity 
showed no significant association with AHI, minimum oxygen 
saturation, most negative Pes (but n=4), sleep efficiency, sleep 
latency, age, male sex, PLMI, or PLMD (all p>0.10, Figure 1B). 
The association between hyperactivity and PLMI remained 
insignificant when two possible outliers with PLMI> 60 were 
removed from the analysis (F=1.037, p=0.3134, R2=0.020). 

An interaction model for all subjects (n=113) verified that 
SDB (as measured by AHI) was a statistically significant effect 
modifier in the relationship between hyperactivity and PLMI 
(Part R2=0.086, p=0.002 for the interaction term): increased

PLMI was associated with increased hyperactivity among subjects 
with higher AHI but not among those with lower AHI 
(Figure 1). Adjustment for age and sex did not change this result 
appreciably (Part R2=0.075, p=0.003). In an analogous interaction 
model for minimum oxygen saturation and PLMI, the interaction 
term showed a trend toward significance (Part R2=0.034, 
p=0.052), even after adjustment for age and sex (Part R2=0.032, 
p=0.056).

higher hyperactivity index t-scores (HIT), but when SDB was absent (B), no such association existed.

polysomnographically-confirmed SDB, but no higher than 
among children without SDB. Levels of hyperactivity were not 
associated with measures of SDB severity, but were associated 
with the presence of PLMS. Upon more detailed analysis, the 
association between hyperactivity and PLMS derived entirely 
from the results of the children who had SDB; no such association 
could be detected among children without SDB. More 
severe SDB, as measured by AHI, linearly increased the strength 
of the association between PLMS and hyperactivity. These 
results—which to the authors’ knowledge represent the first 
quantitative behavioral and polysomnographic comparisons in 
children – are surprising in several respects. Conclusions that 
can be drawn from correlative data in a clinical sample have several 
notable limitations, but the findings may have important 
implications for the hypothesis that inadequate sleep, common to 
several types of sleep disorders, contributes to hyperactivity in 
children. 

The high level of hyperactivity in subjects not found to have 
SDB was unexpected. Previous clinical series that described 
hyperactive behavior in children with polysomnographicallyconfirmed 
SDB did not discuss referred children who did not 
have SDB.1,2 In one study, 11 snoring children without SDB 
showed similar hyperactivity scores to those of 12 children with 
SDB, but the assessment for SDB relied primarily on oximetry 
and video data.4 

Another unexpected observation was the extent to which 
PLMD, in this sample of children studied for suspected SDB, 
was associated with hyperactivity. However, this result is consistent 
with previous studies, among different samples of children, 
that suggest a strong association between PLMD and 
ADHD,10,12,42 especially when PLMD is severe.11 In a consecutive 
series of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, 
26% were identified by parental report as having periodic leg 
movements, studied with polysomnography, and confirmed to 
have PLMIs > 5.12 

Although the current data showed no direct association 
between SDB and hyperactivity, SDB did appear to be an important 
effect modifier43 of the association between PLMS and 
hyperactivity: among subjects with SDB, but not those without 
SDB, PLMI showed a dose-dependent association with hyperactivity. 
This previously unreported finding was not hypothesized 
prior to the study, and therefore requires future confirmation. If 
verifiable, the finding may have implications for mechanisms 
that underlie reports of associations between sleep disorders and 
hyperactivity. 

Our study also has several limitations that stem from techniques 
used and subjects enrolled. First, some of our subjects 
who did not have SDB had other sleep-related diagnoses, and all 
were referred for sleep-related symptoms. Many of the subjects 
had psychiatric problems, neurological problems (especially 
seizures), and medication regimens for which we could not control. 
The complexity of this patient population may reflect, in 
part, the location of our sleep laboratory in a neurology department 
of a large tertiary referral center. In addition, despite use of 
both age-appropriate T-scores and statistical adjustment for age 
effects, the broad age range included in this study suggests that 
hyperactivity, even as measured on a single instrument, is likely 
to represent somewhat different constructs at the two ends of the 
age spectrum. 

Second, SDB may have remained undetected in some cases by 

the methods and criteria used in this study. In adults, the AHI is 
not strongly correlated with objective measures of sleepiness,36,38 
and in children, upper airway resistance syndrome (with AHIs 
close to zero) and OSA reportedly are associated with similar frequencies 
of hyperactivity.1,2 These observations suggest that the 
measure of SDB severity most relevant to behavioral outcomes 
may not be the AHI we calculated. In young children, a shorter 
criterion for apnea and hypopnea length,39 commensurate with 
increased respiratory rates, may produce a more relevant AHI. 
Furthermore, airflow monitoring with nasal pressure cannulae 
are now advocated in adults to increase sensitivity for hypopneas.
40 Failure to detect subtle hypopneas in some patients may 
have allowed some hypopneas to be scored as PLMS, as the two 
phenomena sometimes can be difficult to distinguish. Future 
studies that incorporate more sensitive measures of SDB might 
allow currently undetected relationships to emerge between SDB, 
PLMS, and behavior. 

On the other hand, no outcome-based studies have yet demonstrated 
the advantage of shorter criteria for apneas and hypopneas,
41 and no studies of nasal pressure in children, who are often 
mouth-breathers, have been published. Even if sub-optimal in 
younger children, the AHI derived from 10-second events and 
thermocouple recordings would still be expected to show high (if 
imperfect) correlations with the AHI derived from other criteria 
or equipment. Finally, in a subsample of 19 children in the current 
study, even a gold-standard assessment of respiratory 
effort—esophageal pressure monitoring—failed to show any 
association with hyperactivity. These observations support the 
validity of our central finding that levels of hyperactivity were 
not associated with SDB severity. 

Figure 2 shows several potential mechanisms that could theoretically 
explain associations between sleep disorders and 
hyperactive behavior in children. In model A, SDB, PLMS, and 
other sleep disorders contribute to hyperactive behavior, perhaps 
through intervening variables such as sleep disruption or deprivation. 
Our current data, which show no association between 
SDB and hyperactivity, make the hypothesis that SDB contributes 
directly to the abnormal behavior less tenable. In addition, 
the lack of association between hyperactivity and either 
sleep efficiency or nocturnal sleep latency—though not optimal 
measures of sleep disruption and sleepiness—fail to support the 
idea that sleep disruption or sleepiness acts as an intervening 
variable. In model B, a third, as yet unidentified variable causes 
both PLMS and hyperactive behavior. Neurological disorders, 
antiepileptic agents, and other medications—all of which were 
common in our clinical sample—may affect sleep and behavior, 
and could potentially explain comorbidity of PLMS and hyperactive 
behavior. Correlative data such as ours cannot distinguish 
models A and B. However, model B is difficult to reconcile with 
reports that other sleep disorders besides PLMS are associated 
with hyperactive behavior; that experimental sleep deprivation, 
inadequate sleep, or sleepiness can lead to such behavior; and 
that treatment for a wide range of sleep disorders leads to behavioral 
improvement.2,16,44-46 

In models C and D, PLMS are hypothesized to contribute to 
hyperactive behavior or hyperactive behavior is hypothesized to 
produce PLMS, but in each case SDB or other sleep disorders are 
shown as effect modifiers, as suggested by our data for SDB. 
Only model C, however, is consistent with past reports which 
suggest that treatment for sleep disorders ameliorates hyperactiv-

Figure 2—Several hypothetical models that could explain associations between 
sleep disorders and hyperactivity in children are shown. In Model A, various 
sleep disorders can contribute to hyperactive behavior, perhaps through an intervening 
variable such as sleep disruption. In Model B, a third variable (i.e., some 
as yet unidentified factor) produces both hyperactive behavior and PLMS. In 
Model C, PLMS contribute to hyperactive behavior; SDB and perhaps other disorders 
that disrupt sleep act as effect modifiers and permit the effect of PLMS on 
behavior to be expressed. In Model D, hyperactive behavior leads to PLMS, and 
other sleep disorders again act as effect modifiers. Data from the current study 
arestudy, in combination with those from previous reports, are more consistent 
with Models C and D, but notD than with A or B. SDB = sleep-disordered breathing; 
PLMS = periodic leg movements during sleep. 

ity. The designs of these studies have prevented firm conclusions, 
but we speculate that future data on these important issues 
will support model C. 

Our findings have several important implications for clinical 
practice and research. The results of this study suggest that SDB 
is not a direct cause of hyperactivity in children, though its presence 
may modify a relationship between PLMS and daytime 
behavior. Clinicians who find PLMS and SDB on a polysomnogram 
often dismiss the PLMS as an incidental finding, and treat 
only the SDB. Our findings raise the possibility that treatment of 
either problem could improve a child’s daytime behavior. 
However, our study was observational in design; and associations 
cannot establish causality. Future research should endeavor to 
clarify the central neurophysiology of PLMS and hyperactive 
behavior, to further examine the possibility that PLMS contribute 
to hyperactive behavior, and to explain the behavioral effects of 
nocturnal sleep disruption.
