Summary. Obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
(OSA) 
syndrome 
is 
a 
common 
disorder 
among 
children 
and 
is 
often 
associated 
with 
significant 
morbidity. 
The 
causes 
of 
OSA 
are 
related 
to 
either 
fixed 
upper 
airway 
abnormalities 
such 
as 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy, 
or 
dynamic 
airway 
abnormalities 
such 
as 
laryngomalacia 
and 
pharyngeal 
wall 
collapse. 
The 
aim 
of 
the 
present 
study 
was 
to 
determine 
the 
prevalence 
of 
dynamic 
upper 
airway 
abnormalities, 
based 
on 
endoscopic 
findings, 
in 
normotonic 
and 
hypotonic 
children 
with 
polysomnographically 
documented 
OSA. 
The 
records 
of 
39 
consecutive 
children 
with 
OSA 
who 
underwent 
bronchoscopy 
(22 
with 
normal 
tone, 
and 
17 
with 
hypotonia) 
were 
reviewed. 
The 
prevalence 
of 
dynamic 
defects 
among 
children 
with 
normal 
tone 
decreased 
with 
age. 
All 
7 
patients 
less 
than 
1 
year 
old 
had 
dynamic 
abnormalities 
(isolated 
or 
combined 
fixed/dynamic), 
compared 
to 
only 
66% 
(6/9) 
of 
patients 
between 
1–2 
years 
old, 
and 
17% 
(1/6) 
of 
children 
more 
than 
2 
years 
old. 
In 
contrast, 
dynamic 
abnormalities 
were 
very 
common 
among 
hypotonic 
children, 
independent 
of 
age. 
Since 
children 
with 
dynamic 
defects 
are 
less 
likely 
to 
respond 
to 
surgical 
treatments, 
it 
would 
be 
appropriate 
to 
identify 
these 
children 
prior 
to 
any 
intervention. 
Due 
to 
the 
higher 
frequency 
of 
dynamic 
defects 
in 
both 
infants 
(<1 
year) 
and 
hypotonic 
children, 
it 
may 
be 
appropriate 
to 
include 
endoscopy 
as 
part 
of 
the 
diagnostic 
evaluation 
of 
OSA 
in 
these 
subgroups.

INTRODUCTION 

Nearly 
3% 
of 
children 
are 
estimated 
to 
suffer 
from 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
(OSA), 
a 
disorder 
characterized 
by 
repeated 
and 
frequent 
episodes 
of 
airway 
obstruction 
associated 
with 
clinical 
symptoms 
of 
disturbed 
sleep, 
snoring, 
and 
behavioral 
alterations, 
together 
with 
intermittent 
hypoxemia 
and 
hypercapnia.1 
Among 
several 
therapeutic 
modalities 
for 
OSA, 
adenoidectomy 
and/or 
tonsillectomy 
(T&A) 
to 
relieve 
anatomic 
causes 
of 
obstruction 
are 
the 
most 
frequently 
employed 
interventions 
used.2 
In 
a 
majority 
of 
patients, 
this 
procedure 
is 
curative. 
However, 
up 
to 
21.5% 
will 
not 
have 
clinical 
improvement 
after 
surgery.3 
This 
is 
a 
significant 
number, 
given 
both 
the 
costs 
and 
potential 
complications 
associated 
with 
this 
procedure.2 


To 
increase 
the 
rate 
of 
successful 
T&A 
and 
other 
surgical 
procedures, 
it 
would 
be 
important 
to 
identify 
prior 
to 
surgery 
those 
children 
most 
likely 
to 
benefit 
from 
the 
procedure. 
Most 
cases 
of 
OSA 
are 
related 
to 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy, 
and 
for 
these 
cases, 
T&A 
should 
be 
effective. 
However, 
other 
causes 
of 
OSA, 
such 
as 
pharyngeal 
dysfunction, 
neuromuscular 
defects, 
and/or 
dysmorphic 
abnormalities, 
are 
less 
likely 
to 
be 
amenable 
to 
treatment 
with 
T&A, 
whose 
purpose 
is 
to 
relieve 
anatomic 
obstruction.4–7 


The 
aim 
of 
this 
study 
was 
to 
examine 
the 
mechanisms 
of 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
in 
patients 
with 
hypotonia 


.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Patient Population 

The 
charts 
of 
all 
children 
who 
underwent 
both 
fiberoptic 
endoscopy 
and 
polysomnography 
for 
evaluation 
of 
OSA 
by 
the 
pediatric 
pulmonary 
service 
in 
Shaare 
Zedek 
Medical 
Center 
between 
1996–2001 
were 
reviewed. 
To 
be 
included 
in 
the 
analysis, 
subjects 
had 
to 
have 
documented 
OSA 
based 
on 
polysomnographic 
findings 
(see 
below). 


For 
patients 
included 
in 
the 
study, 
information 
pertaining 
to 
clinical 
presentation 
and 
physical 
examination 
findings, 
including 
muscle 
tone 
and 
tonsillar 
size, 
were 
recorded. 
Generalized 
muscle 
tone 
was 
defined 
as 
normal 
or 
low, 
based 
on 
physical 
examination 
by 
the 
referring 
pulmonologist. 
In 
addition, 
indications 
for 
endoscopy 
and 
polysomnography 
and 
their 
results 
were 
noted. 


Upper Airway Endoscopy 

Endoscopic 
examinations 
were 
done 
with 
patients 
in 
supine 
position, 
using 
a 
3.6-mm 
flexible 
fiberoptic 
bronchoscope 
(Olympus 
model 
BF-3c20) 
introduced 
through 
the 
nasal 
cavity. 
The 
dynamics 
and 
anatomy 
of 
the 
pharynx/hypopharynx 
and 
larynx 
were 
assessed 
with 
the 
patient 
spontaneously 
breathing 
under 
sedation, 
utilizing 
Midazolam 
0.1 
mg/kg 
body 
weight 
and 
Fentanyl 
1–2 
mg/kg, 
or 
Diprofol 
0.1–0.2 
mg/kg. 
The 
dose 
was 
titrated 
to 
the 
point 
that 
subjects 
did 
not 
have 
a 
significant 
resistance 
to 
introduction 
of 
a 
bronchoscope 
through 
the 
nares. 
Lidocaine 
(0.5% 
up 
to 
1.5 
years 
of 
age, 
and 
1% 
thereafter) 
was 
sprayed 
in 
the 
laryngeal 
area 
after 
initial 
observation 
of 
laryngeal 
function, 
which 
was 
followed 
by 
endoscope 
insertion 
into 
the 
trachea. 


Observed 
abnormalities 
were 
categorized 
as 
either 
fixed 
or 
dynamic. 
Abnormalities 
categorized 
as 
fixed 
included 
narrow 
nasal 
passageways 
(difficulties 
in 
passing 
a 
3.6-mm 
endoscope 
through 
the 
nasal 
turbinates), 
adenoidal 
hypertrophy 
with 
more 
than 
50% 
narrowing 
of 
the 
nasopharynx, 
tonsillar 
hypertrophy 
(tonsils 
occupying 
more 
than 
2/3 
of 
the 
oropharynx), 
and 
tongue 
enlargement 
compromising 
the 
airway. 
Dynamic 
abnormalities 
included 
pharyngeal 
wall 
collapse 
(complete 
or 
near-complete 
closure 
of 
the 
glottic 
entrance 
caused 
by 
inspiratory-induced 
collapse 
of 
the 
pharyngeal 
walls) 
and 
laryngomalacia. 
Patients 
with 
normal 
anatomy 
on 
bronchoscopy, 
but 
with 
abnormal 
findings 
on 
polysomnography, 
were 
considered 
to 
have 
dynamic 
abnormalities. 


Polysomnography 

Polysomnography 
was 
conducted 
using 
a 
12-channel 
polygraph. 
Flow 
was 
detected 
using 
a 
nasal 
thermocouple, 


and 
respiratory 
effort 
was 
assessed 
using 
abdominal 
and 
chest 
bands. 
Electroencephalogram 
(EEG), 
electrooculogram 
(EOG), 
electrocardiogram 
(EKG), 
and 
electromyogram 
(EMG), 
oxygen 
saturation, 
and 
end-tidal 
CO2 
were 
recorded 
as 
well. 
Obstructive 
apnea 
was 
defined 
as 
cessation 
of 
breathing 
with 
normal 
respiratory 
effort. 
Obstructive 
hypopnea 
was 
categorized 
as 
a 
decrease 
in 
flow 
signal 
by 
50% 
or 
greater 
with 
normal 
respiratory 
effort. 
For 
the 
diagnosis 
of 
OSA, 
the 
apnea-hypopnea 
index 
(AHI; 
number 
of 
obstructive 
apnea 
and 
hypopnea 
events 
in 
1 
hr) 
had 
to 
be 
1/hr. 


Statistical Analysis 

Differences 
between 
groups 
were 
assessed 
by 
chi-
square 
test. 
For 
groups 
with 
less 
than 
5 
subjects, 
Fisher’s 
exact 
test 
was 
employed. 


RESULTS 

During 
the 
period 
from 
1996–2001, 
49 
patients 
underwent 
both 
polysomnography 
and 
endoscopy. 
The 
indication 
for 
polysomnography 
in 
all 
cases 
was 
suspected 
OSA. 
Of 
these 
patients, 
38 
underwent 
endoscopy 
to 
identify 
possible 
upper 
airway 
obstruction. 
The 
other 
11 
patients 
underwent 
endoscopy 
for 
other 
indications, 
including 
recurrent 
pneumonia, 
recurrent 
wheezing, 
evaluation 
of 
atelectasis, 
or 
chronic 
obstructive 
pulmonary 
disease 
(COPD), 
and 
to 
obtain 
bronchoalveolar 
lavage 
and 
culture. 
Thirty-nine 
patients 
had 
an 
AHI 
1.0/hr 
indicative 
of 
OSA, 
and 
were 
included 
in 
the 
study. 


The 
clinical 
characteristics 
of 
the 
OSA 
group 
are 
summarized 
in 
Table 
1. 
The 
median 
age 
of 
patients 
at 
time 
of 
evaluation 
was 
15 
months, 
with 
38% 
of 
patients 
being 
less 
than 
1 
year 
old. 
There 
was 
a 
strong 
male 
preponderance: 
the 
male:female 
ratio 
was 
2.55. 
When 
the 
OSA 
group 
was 
categorized 
according 
to 
the 
presence 
or 
absence 
of 
generalized 
hypotonia 
as 
noted 
on 
physical 
examination, 
nearly 
half 
of 
the 
patients 
were 
found 
to 
be 
hypotonic. 
In 
the 
majority 
of 
cases 
(71%), 
hypotonia 
was 
associated 
with 
either 
a 
systemic 
disorder 
or 
genetic 
syndrome 
(4 
with 
trisomy 
21, 
2 
with 
other 
chromosomal 
abnormalities, 
1 
with 
periarteritis 
nodosa, 
and 
1 
with 
Prader-Willi 
syndrome). 
Four 
children 
were 
suspected 
of 
having 
a 
genetic 
syndrome 
because 
of 
hypotonia, 
slow 
development, 
and 
unusual 
looking 
facies 
or 
other 
dysmorphology, 
even 
though 
an 
identifiable 
syndrome 
could 
not 
be 
diagnosed. 


The 
endoscopic 
findings 
of 
study 
patients 
are 
also 
summarized 
in 
Table 
1. 
The 
major 
fixed 
airway 
abnormalities 
found 
were 
adenoidal 
hypertrophy 
(64% 
of 
patients) 
and 
tonsillar 
hypertrophy 
(31% 
of 
patients). 
The 
major 
dynamic 
abnormalities 
found 
were 
laryngomalacia 
(44% 
of 
patients) 
and 
pharyngeal 
wall 
collapse 
on 
inspiration 
(38% 
of 
patients). 
A 
large 
percentage 
of 
children 
(41%) 
had 
both 
dynamic 
and 
fixed 
abnormalities.

In 
15% 
(6/39) 
of 
cases, 
neither 
dynamic 
nor 
fixed 
abnormalities 
were 
identified, 
and 
these 
children 
were 
presumed 
to 
have 
OSA 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
a 
dynamic 
disorder 
not 
demonstrable 
by 
endoscopy. 


Of 
17 
patients 
with 
laryngomalacia, 
16 
had 
associated 
disorders. 
Five 
had 
associated 
pharyngeal 
wall

6 
had 
adenoidal 
hypertrophy, 
and 
5 
had 
both. 
Only 
5 
patients 
with 
laryngomalacia 
presented 
with 
stridor. 


The 
occurrence 
of 
dynamic 
abnormalities 
decreased 
with 
age. 
As 
shown 
in 
Figure 
1, 
all 
7 
normotonic 
patients 
less 
than 
1 
year 
old 
had 
dynamic 
abnormalities, 
compared 
to 
only 
66% 
(6/9) 
of 
patients 
between 
1–2 
years 
old, 
and 
17% 
(1/6) 
of 
children 
more 
than 
2 
years 
old. 
The 
difference 
in 
frequency 
of 
dynamic 
abnormalities 
among 
children 
<1 
year 
old 
compared 
to 
>2 
years 
old 
is 
highly 
significant 
(P 
¼ 
0.005), 
and 
remains 
significant 
even 
when 
children 
with 
normal 
endoscopic 
findings 
are 
removed 
from 
the 
analysis. 
The 
decline 
in 
dynamic 
abnormalities 
with 
increasing 
age 
is 
characteristic 
only 
of 
children 
with 
normal 
tone. 
This 
trend 
is 
not 
seen 
in 
children 
with 
hypotonia, 
among 
whom 
the 
rate 
of 
dynamic 
abnormalities 
does 
not 
significantly 
vary 
with 
age 
(Fig. 
2A). 
For 
children 
who 
are 
2 
years 
old, 
the 
percentage 
of 
dynamic 
abnormalities 
in 
hypotonic 
children 
is 
significantly 
greater 
than 
in 
children 
with 
normal 
tone 
(83% 
vs. 
17% 
respectively; 
P 
¼ 
0.04). 


The 
frequency 
of 
fixed 
disorders 
increases 
with 
age, 
both 
among 
children 
with 
normal 
tone 
and 
those 
with 
hypotonia 
(Fig. 
2B). 


DISCUSSION 

In 
this 
study, 
we 
found 
that 
in 
children 
with 
OSA 
and 
normal 
muscle 
tone, 
the 
prevalence 
of 
fixed 
abnormalities 


of 
the 
upper 
airways 
increases 
with 
age, 
while 
dynamic 
abnormalities 
decrease. 
All 
patients 
less 
than 
1 
year 
old 
with 
normal 
tone 
had 
dynamic 
abnormalities 
(isolated 
or 
combined 
with 
fixed 
defects), 
as 
compared 
to 
only 
1/6 
of 
children 
older 
than 
2 
years. 
Similar 
to 
children 
with 
normal 
tone, 
the 
hypotonic 
children 
also 
had 
a 
higher 
rate

2 years old is significant (P¼0.005).

of 
fixed 
abnormalities 
with 
increasing 
age. 
In 
contrast, 
children 
characterized 
as 
hypotonic 
did 
not 
show 
a 
decline 
in 
the 
frequency 
of 
dynamic 
abnormalities, 
and 
approximately 
80% 
of 
such 
children 
older 
than 
2 
years 


had 
either 
isolated 
dynamic 
or 
combined 
dynamic/fixed 
abnormalities. 


The 
increased 
frequency 
of 
dynamic 
defects 
in 
normal 
children 
less 
than 
1 
year 
old 
can 
be 
explained 
by 
anatomic 
and 
physiologic 
aspects 
of 
the 
infant 
upper 
airway 
that 
predispose 
them 
to 
OSA. 
Obstructive 
apnea 
occurs 
when 
the 
opening 
force 
generated 
by 
pharyngeal 
dilating 
muscles 
is 
not 
sufficient 
to 
overcome 
the 
negative 
pressure 
within 
the 
pharynx. 
Anatomic 
features 
unique 
to 
the 
infant 
upper 
airway, 
including 
the 
narrow 
upper 
airway 
diameter, 
relatively 
large 
tongue 
size, 
shape 
of 
the 
jaw, 
and 
close 
apposition 
of 
the 
tongue 
and 
larynx, 
facilitate 
airway 
narrowing 
and 
contribute 
to 
relatively 
high 
negative 
pharyngeal 
pressure 
during 
inspiration.8,9 
In 
addition, 
the 
mean 
closing 
pressure 
of 
the 
passive 
larynx 
is 
relatively 
high 
among 
normal 
infants 
as 
compared 
to 
older 
children. 
The 
combination 
of 
highly 
negative 
pharyngeal 
pressure 
and 
relatively 
high 
laryngeal 
closing 
pressure 
in 
infants 
renders 
them 
prone 
to 
dynamic 
airway 
obstruction.
6,10 
As 
children 
get 
older, 
the 
airway 
matures, 
and 
closing 
pressure 
decreases. 
OSA 
then 
is 
most 
often 
caused 
by 
fixed 
obstructions 
such 
as 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy. 


Children 
with 
hypotonia 
have 
neuromuscular 
disorders 
that 
can 
affect 
both 
muscle 
strength 
and 
the 
central 
control 
of 
breathing.7 
Similar 
to 
infants, 
hypotonic 
children 
often 
do 
not 
generate 
enough 
tone 
in 
the 
pharyngeal 
dilating 
muscles 
during 
sleep 
to 
keep 
the 
pharynx 
and 
larynx 
open, 
thereby 
causing 
OSA. 
Because 
these 
defects 
do 
not 
change 
over 
time, 
it 
would 
not 
be 
expected 
that 
the 
frequency 
of 
dynamic 
disorders 
would 
decline 
with 
advancing 
age. 


In 
our 
study, 
6 
(4 
hypotonic 
and 
2 
normotonic 
patients, 
all 
less 
than 
2 
years 
old) 
of 
39 
children 
with 
OSA 
had 
a 
normal 
upper 
airway 
endoscopy. 
Normal 
endoscopy 
in 
a 
patient 
with 
OSA 
suggests 
an 
intermittent 
dynamic 
rather 
than 
fixed 
abnormality. 
Normal 
bronchoscopies 
in 
patients 
with 
OSA 
were 
previously 
reported.11 
Since 
OSA 
is 
an 
intermittent 
phenomenon, 
with 
some 
patients 
having 
only 
few 
episodes 
of 
obstruction 
per 
hour, 
the 
absence 
of 
an 
overt 
closing 
sight 
observed 
during 
the 
examination 
is 
not 
surprising. 
Moreover, 
apnea 
events 
can 
be 
related 
to 
a 
specific 
body 
position, 
and 
not 
necessarily 
the 
supine 
one 
maintained 
during 
endoscopy. 
Since 
no 
anatomical 
abnormality 
was 
seen 
in 
these 
6 
patients, 
it 
is 
likely 
that 
these 
patients 
have 
intermittently 
collapsing 
airways. 


Several 
studies12–16 
described 
an 
association 
between 
laryngomalacia 
and 
obstructive 
apnea. 
In 
this 
current 
series, 
17 
patients 
had 
laryngomalacia, 
16 
of 
them 
with 
associated 
disorders, 
so 
we 
cannot 
isolate 
the 
major 
mechanism 
of 
obstruction 
in 
these 
patients. 
However, 
our 
clinical 
impression 
is 
that 
OSA 
and 
laryngomalacia 
are 
causally 
associated. 


It 
should 
be 
noted 
that 
patients 
with 
combined 
fixed 
and 
dynamic 
airway 
abnormalities 
can 
be 
divided 
into 
two 



groups. 
One 
consists 
of 
children 
with 
a 
fixed 
airway 
abnormality 
combined 
with 
a 
primary 
dynamic 
airway 
abnormality. 
The 
other 
group 
consists 
of 
children 
with 
fixed 
airway 
obstruction 
associated 
with 
a 
secondary 
dynamic 
airway 
obstruction. 
Secondary 
dynamic 
airway 
obstruction 
is 
a 
result 
of 
normally 
increased 
inspiratory 
negative 
pressure 
generated 
to 
overcome 
the 
fixed 
obstruction. 
Although 
not 
done 
in 
this 
series, 
introduction 
of 
a 
nasopharyngeal 
tube 
in 
order 
to 
bypass 
the 
fixed 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
might 
enable 
separating 
primary 
from 
secondary 
dynamic 
obstructions. 
Whatever 
the 
mechanism 
(primary 
or 
secondary), 
dynamic 
airway 
obstruction 
is 
very 
frequent 
in 
infants 
and 
hypotonic 
children 
with 
OSA, 
but 
is 
rare 
in 
normotonic 
toddlers 
with 
OSA. 


The 
number 
of 
children 
with 
dynamic 
abnormalities 
may 
be 
overrepresented 
in 
our 
study. 
One 
cannot 
easily 
observe 
the 
complex 
functional 
anatomy 
of 
the 
extra-
thoracic 
airway 
without 
inserting 
an 
instrument 
into 
the 
airway, 
which 
inevitably 
affects 
pressures 
and 
resistance 
within 
the 
airway. 
Insertion 
of 
a 
bronchoscope 
through 
the 
nasal 
cavity 
increases 
upper 
airway 
resistance, 
especially 
in 
infants, 
who 
already 
have 
narrow 
airways. 
The 
increased 
resistance 
may 
augment 
the 
negative 
pressure 
within 
the 
pharynx 
that 
is 
modulated 
by 
the 
respiratory 
muscles 
in 
order 
to 
maintain 
sufficient 
flow. 
This 
increased 
negative 
pressure 
can 
induce 
phenomena 
that 
mimic 
overcompliant 
airways 
but 
are 
not 
physiologic. 
It 
is 
possible, 
then, 
that 
in 
some 
of 
our 
patients, 
the 
over-
compliance 
of 
the 
airway 
was 
induced 
by 
the 
endoscopy 
itself. 
Hence, 
great 
care 
needs 
to 
accompany 
the 
physician 
who 
uses 
bronchoscopy 
to 
elucidate 
the 
etiologies 
of 
OSA 
in 
early 
childhood. 


Endoscopies 
were 
also 
done 
when 
the 
patient 
was 
under 
sedation. 
Sedatives 
induce 
reduction 
in 
neural 
activities 
of 
the 
hypoglossal 
and 
recurrent 
laryngeal 
nerves,17 
and 
may 
worsen 
OSA.18 
Thus 
it 
is 
possible, 
in 
some 
cases, 
that 
the 
overcompliant 
airway 
was 
caused 
by 
sedation. 
In 
an 
attempt 
to 
minimize 
this 
artifact, 
lidocaine 
was 
sprayed 
in 
the 
laryngeal 
area 
only 
after 
initial 
observation 
of 
its 
function. 
In 
addition, 
dynamic 
upper 
airway 
events 
were 
reassessed 
while 
the 
patient 
was 
awakening. 
Another 
way 
that 
might 
help 
identify 
an 
artificial 
obstruction 
caused 
by 
sedation 
or 
by 
increased 
resistance 
induced 
by 
the 
bronchoscope 
is 
to 
ask 
the 
parents 
if 
the 
noise 
(stridor 
or 
snoring) 
heard 
during 
the 
procedure 
is 
the 
same 
as 
heard 
at 
home, 
and 
if 
the 
work 
of 
breathing 
during 
sedation 
is 
similar 
to 
that 
observed 
during 
sleep 
at 
home. 


An 
interesting 
finding 
is 
the 
high 
male 
preponderance 
of 
patients 
in 
our 
study. 
While 
among 
adults, 
OSA 
is 
more 
common 
in 
the 
male 
population, 
the 
same 
was 
not 
found 
to 
be 
true 
in 
children.19,20 
However, 
a 
male 
predilection 
is 
seen 
in 
infants, 
and 
this 
may 
partially 
explain 
our 
findings.21 
Our 
patient 
population 
was 
also 
not 
fully 
representative 
of 
childhood 
OSA, 
as 
most 
children 
with 
OSA 
do 
not 
undergo 
endoscopy 
when 
diagnosed 
with 


Endoscopic Findings in Obstructive Sleep Apnea 209 

OSA 
by 
polysomnography, 
and 
some 
patients 
underwent 
endoscopy 
for 
indications 
other 
than 
OSA. 


T&A 
is 
the 
treatment 
of 
choice 
for 
childhood 
OSA, 
and 
is 
effective 
therapy 
in 
the 
majority 
of 
cases.3 
Unfortunately, 
a 
significant 
percentage 
of 
children 
do 
not 
improve 
after 
T&A, 
some 
of 
them 
because 
of 
persistent 
dynamic 
disorders. 
Patients 
with 
OSA 
and 
dynamic 
airway 
disorder 
might 
improve 
by 
adenotonsillectomy 
even 
in 
cases 
of 
only 
mild 
adenotonsillar 
enlargement, 
because 
this 
procedure 
will 
decrease 
resistance 
in 
the 
upper 
airway 
and 
might 
even 
improve 
the 
accompanying 
dynamic 
disorder. 
Although 
some 
of 
these 
patients 
will 
not 
benefit 
from 
the 
procedure, 
it 
is 
worth 
trying. 
It 
is 
less 
clear 
if 
normal-sized 
tonsils 
and 
adenoids 
should 
be 
removed. 
For 
these 
children, 
alternative 
therapies 
designed 
to 
keep 
the 
airway 
patent 
(e.g., 
continuous 
positive 
airway 
pressure) 
may 
be 
more 
appropriate.22 


The 
results 
of 
our 
study 
suggest 
that 
in 
selected 
populations, 
endoscopic 
evaluation 
may 
be 
a 
valuable 
tool 
in 
determining 
the 
etiology 
of 
OSA 
and 
in 
providing 
prognostic 
information 
as 
to 
whether 
these 
children 
will 
benefit 
from 
T&A 
or 
other 
surgical 
procedures. 
Moreover, 
children 
with 
dynamic 
lesions 
need 
to 
be 
observed 
in 
hospital 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
with 
continuous 
monitoring 
because 
of 
their 
vulnerability 
to 
ongoing 
symptomology. 


In 
conclusion, 
many 
children 
with 
OSA, 
especially 
those 
<1 
year 
old 
or 
with 
neuromuscular 
disorders, 
would 
be 
well-served 
by 
careful 
endoscopic 
evaluation 
of 
their 
upper 
airways 
before 
intervention 
is 
planned. 
Finding 
the 
mechanism 
of 
obstruction 
will 
aid 
in 
determining 
the 
appropriate 
medical 
(e.g., 
continuous 
positive 
airway 
pressure) 
or 
surgical 
intervention, 
increase 
the 
rate 
of 
success 
for 
the 
treatment 
of 
OSA, 
and 
help 
in 
planning 
postoperative 
care.
