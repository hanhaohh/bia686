nasal CPAP therapy on respiratory and spontaneous arousals 
in infants with OSA. J. Appl. Physiol. 87(3): 889–896, 1999.— 
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in infants has been shown to 
resolve frequently without a cortical arousal. It is unknown 
whether infants do not require arousal to terminate apneas or 
whether this is a consequence of the OSA. We studied the 
apnea and arousal patterns of eight infants with OSA before 
and after treatment with nasal continuous positive airway 
pressure (CPAP). These infants were age matched to eight 
untreated infants with OSA and eight normal infants. Polysomnographic 
studies were performed on each infant. We 
found that the majority of central and obstructive apneas 
were terminated without arousal in all OSA infants. After 
several weeks of nasal CPAP treatment, the proportion of 
apneas terminating with an arousal during rapid-eyemovement 
sleep increased in treated infants compared with 
untreated infants. Spontaneous arousals during rapid-eyemovement 
sleep were reduced in all OSA infants; however, 
during CPAP treatment, the spontaneous arousals increased 
to the normal control level. We conclude that OSA in infants 
possibly depresses the arousal response and treatment of 
these infants with nasal CPAP partially reverses this depression. 


rapid-eye-movement sleep; obstructive apnea; spontaneous 
arousals; respiratory arousals; nasal continuous positive 
airway pressure 

AROUSAL FROM SLEEP IS CONSIDERED to be an important 
response to a respiratory stimulus, allowing an individual 
to initiate protective reflexes that are depressed 
during sleep (22). Several respiratory stimuli, including 
hypoxia (11), hypercapnia (21), airway occlusion (9, 
7), and laryngeal stimulation (29), can induce arousal 
from sleep and stimulate reflex respiratory changes. 
The arousal response has been shown to differ between 
different sleep states; stronger stimuli are often required 
to induce arousal from rapid-eye-movement 
(REM) sleep than from non-rapid-eye-movement 
(NREM) sleep (7, 21, 29). 

Arousal is a prominent feature of the adult obstructive 
sleep apnea (OSA) syndromes (27), and the arousal 
threshold to upper airway occlusion and hypoxia has 
been demonstrated to be higher in OSA patients than in 
normal subjects (13). Adults with OSA can experience 
profound oxyhemoglobin desaturation before awakening 
(6), which is more severe during REM sleep (27). 

The costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the 
payment of page charges. The article must therefore be hereby 
marked ‘‘advertisement’’ in accordance with 18 U.S.C. Section 1734 
solely to indicate this fact. 

The potential mechanisms of the increased arousal 
threshold are unknown; however, it has been suggested 
that sleep fragmentation and repeated hypoxemia associated 
with OSA may be involved. Recently, it was 
found that the impairment of the arousal responsiveness 
to occlusion was partially reversed after long-term 
treatment with nasal CPAP (4, 5). 

Previously, we have shown that the majority of 
obstructive and central apneas in infants and children 
are not resolved with an accompanying electroencephalogram 
(EEG) arousal (18). It was also demonstrated 
that infants with OSA have a reduction in the number 
of spontaneous arousals during REM sleep compared 
with normal infants. It is not known whether infants do 
not require arousal to resolve an obstructive event or 
whether, similar to adults, arousal has been depressed 
as a consequence of the OSA. The effects of OSA on 
arousability in infants during NREM and REM sleep 
have not been previously described. 

We hypothesized that OSA in an infant is associated 
with a depressed arousability and that treatment of 
OSAwould result in an increase in an infant’s arousability. 
Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) 
therapy has been demonstrated previously to be an 
effective treatment for OSA in infants, preventing 
obstruction and reversing the associated sleep disturbances 
(8, 17). We examined the respiratory and spontaneous 
arousal patterns during overnight polysomnographic 
studies in infants who had OSA and required 
treatment with nasal-mask CPAP. We studied these 
infants before treatment with nasal CPAP and on the 
first night of CPAP withdrawal after several weeks of 
CPAP therapy. Their respiratory and spontaneous 
arousal patterns were compared with those of normal 
infants and infants with OSA who were not treated. We 
wanted to determine the effects of nasal CPAP treatment 
on respiratory and spontaneous arousability and 
whether there were any differences between NREM 
and REM sleep. 

METHODS 

Patients 

Three separate groups of infants were included in the 
study. All of the infants studied had been referred to our sleep 
unit for investigation of OSA either because of a family 
history of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or because 
they had experienced an apparent life-threatening event. All 
infants included in the study were normal on clinical examination 
while awake and had no anatomic or congenital 
abnormality. 

We studied eight infants who were diagnosed with OSA 
from a diagnostic sleep study and were treated with nasal-

EFFECT OF NASAL CPAP ON INFANT AROUSAL 

mask CPAP therapy (group I). OSA in the present study was 
defined as obstructive events recorded in the diagnostic study 
in excess of five events per hour of sleep. These infants were 
between 6 and 18 wk of age when they were first diagnosed 
with OSA. The decision to treat these infants with nasal 
CPAP was based on the severity of OSA. Infants were treated 
with nasal CPAP if their obstructive apnea index exceeded 15 
apneas/h of total sleep time. Treatment with nasal CPAP was 
commenced within 2 wk of diagnosis. We also selected a 
control group of eight infants (control infants) who had 
undergone overnight polysomnographic studies and had normal 
sleep and breathing patterns. In addition, a group of 
eight infants who were diagnosed with OSA but were not 
treated with nasal CPAP was also included (group II). These 
infants were monitored at home with a cardiorespiratory 
monitor. The control and untreated groups of OSA infants 
were age-matched to the group I infants for the first diagnostic 
and a repeat diagnostic study performed ,7 wk later. The 
clinical characteristics of the three groups of infants are 
described in Table 1. 

Polygraphic Monitoring 

Each infant underwent overnight polysomnographic recordings. 
The polysomnographic data were recorded on a Grass 
(model 8) 12-channel EEG polygraph recorder (Grass Instrument, 
Quincy, MA). In each patient, sleep was monitored with 
two channels of EEG (C3-A2,O2-A1, 10–20 international 
placement system), two channels of electrooculogram, and 
submental electromyogram (EMG). Diaphragm (EMGDia) and 
abdominal EMG were also measured. The electrocardiogram 
was measured continuously. Pulse oximetry with the use of a 
foot probe was measured continuously as an indication of 
arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation (Ohmeda Biox 3700E, 
Denver, CO). Transcutaneous CO2 was measured continuously 
with a transcutaneous probe (TCM3, Radiometer, Copenhagen, 
Denmark) as an indication of arterial partial pressure 
of CO2. Airflow was monitored by using small infant nasal 
prongs that were placed in the infant’s nostrils and then 
attached to a pressure transducer (DP103, Validyne, North-
ridge, CA). Chest wall and abdominal movements were 
measured by using inductance plethysmography (Respitrace, 
Ambulatory Monitoring, Ardsley, NY). 

Each infant underwent at least two overnight sleep studies. 
The first was a diagnostic study to determine the severity 
of obstructive and central apnea and the sleeping pattern in 
each of the infants. Follow-up diagnostic sleep studies were 
repeated at 1-to 2-mo intervals to review the progress of the 
infant’s apnea. Infants who were treated with nasal-mask 
CPAP had an additional study within 1 wk of their initial

diagnostic study to commence nasal CPAP therapy, and the 
appropriate CPAP pressure was determined. After the CPAP 
study, each infant in group I continued treatment during 
sleep at home. The follow-up diagnostic study was performed 
without CPAP and was the first night of nasal CPAP removal 
since treatment was started. 

Each study was started at the time the infant normally 
went to sleep for the night, usually between 7:00 and 9:00 PM. 
Each study was stopped at 6:00 AM the following morning. All 
patients were observed throughout each study by the nursing 
staff. Any movements, changes in body position, crying, 
mouth breathing, or nursing interventions were recorded on 
the polygraph paper. 

Nasal CPAP 

Each infant treated with nasal CPAP underwent a CPAP 
pressure determination study to determine the appropriate 
level of CPAP pressure. An overnight polysomnographic 
study was performed with the same setup as the diagnostic 
study except that nasal CPAP was applied throughout sleep. 
Nasal CPAP was applied by using commercially available 
CPAP machines and infant masks (ResMed, Sydney, Australia). 
The mask was fitted over the infant’s nose and secured 
with a head strap (Remcap, Sydney, Australia). Nasal CPAP 
was commenced on the lowest level, i.e., 3.7 cmH2O, and the 
pressure was gradually increased by small increments (0.3 
cmH2O) during inspiration until the obstructive events were 
abolished. As the pressure was increased, the breathing 
patterns and CO2 recordings were monitored carefully. The 
optimal pressure was the level that minimized obstructive 
events and did not increase the CO2 level or the length of 
central apneas. 

Analysis 

Each polysomnographic study was scored, and 60-s epochs 
of recording were assigned as either NREM sleep, REM sleep, 
or awake according to established criteria for neonates and 
infants (1, 23). NREM sleep was further subdivided into light 
sleep equivalent to stage 1–2 NREM and slow-wave sleep 
equivalent to stage 3–4 NREM sleep. The total time in each 
sleep state and the proportion of total sleep time spent in 
stage 1–2 NREM, slow-wave sleep, and REM sleep were 
calculated. 

All apneas were scored on each study. An apnea was 
defined as a cessation of respiration for the duration of at 
least two respiratory cycles, which was ,3 s in the infants 
studied. Apneas were classified as central when there was an 
absence of airflow, EMGDia, and Respitrace movements. Obstructive 
apneas were scored if there was an absence of 
airflow and continued EMGDia bursts and deflections from the 
Respitrace. An apnea was classified as mixed if it involved a 
central and obstructive component. The number of central, 
mixed, and obstructive apneas was summed during each 
study. For the purpose of analysis, mixed and obstructive 
apneas were combined and are referred to as obstructive 
apneas. An apnea index (apneas/h) was calculated for central, 
obstructive, and total apneas during NREM and REM sleep 
for each study. 

Arousals were scored according to EEG, EMG, and behavioral 
criteria, similar to those outlined by our previous 
findings (18). An arousal was defined as an abrupt change in 
the EEG to alpha frequencies (8–13 Hz) or frequencies .16 
Hz for a minimum of 1 s. During REM sleep, arousals were 
scored if the change in EEG was accompanied by an increase 
in the amplitude of the submental EMG signal. The arousals 
were then classified as either respiratory or spontaneous. A

respiratory arousal was defined as an arousal that occurred 
at the termination of, or immediately after, an apnea, whereas 
a spontaneous arousal was defined as an arousal that occurred 
without any preceding respiratory event. The number 
of each type of arousal for NREM and REM sleep was 
calculated and expressed as an arousal index (arousals/h). In 
addition, the percentage of central, obstructive, and total 
apneas that resulted in arousal was calculated for NREM and 
REM sleep for each study. 

The apnea, sleep, and arousal data were combined and 
averaged according to the infant group and sleep state. The 
differences in the central and obstructive apnea index and in 
the respiratory and spontaneous arousal index between the 
first and follow-up diagnostic studies for each of the three 
groups of infants were examined according to sleep state with 
the paired t-test. The differences in the apnea and arousal 
patterns recorded in each of the diagnostic studies between 
the two groups of infants with OSA (groups I and II) and the 
control infants were examined by using ANOVA. The apnea, 
sleep, and arousal pattern of the CPAP study in group I 
infants was compared with their first diagnostic study by 
using the rank-sum test and paired t-test. The arousal 
pattern of CPAP was also compared with the first diagnostic 
study of the control infants by using the unpaired t-test. All 

data are expressed as means 6 SE. A P value of ,0.05 was 
considered significant. 

RESULTS 

Sleep Apnea and Sleeping Pattern 

Obstructive apneas were recorded during NREM and 
REM sleep in the first and follow-up diagnostic studies 
of the group I and II infants, and the severity ranged 
from moderate to severe. Obstructive apnea was more 
frequent in group I than in group II infants (P , 0.05, 
t-test). The control infants had either occasional or no 
obstructive events recorded during their first diagnostic 
study (Table 2). Central apnea was recorded in all 
the infants and varied in severity among individual 
infants. The number of central apneas during NREM 
and REM sleep was significantly higher in group I and 
II infants, who had OSA, than in the control infants 
(P , 0.05, t-test). Apnea length and the arterial oxyhemoglobin 
saturation level associated with central and 
obstructive apnea were similar for all three groups of 
infants during both diagnostic studies (Table 3).

EFFECT OF NASAL CPAP ON INFANT AROUSAL 

Treatment with nasal CPAP in group I infants resulted 
in a prevention of nearly all obstructive events 
during both NREM and REM sleep (P , 0.05, rank 
sum; Table 2). Nasal CPAP treatment was also associated 
with a significant reduction in central apnea 
during NREM sleep, whereas, during REM sleep, central 
apneas were decreased, but the difference was not 
significant (P . 0.05, t-test; Table 2). Each of the 
infants who was treated tolerated the CPAP mask and 
the CPAP well. Parents reported, at the time of the 
follow-up diagnostic study, that their infant had been 
sleeping well at home with the use of nasal CPAP 
therapy. 

During the follow-up diagnostic study, central apnea 
and OSA were still recorded in both group I and II 
infants; however, the number was smaller than that 
recorded in the previous diagnostic studies (Table 2). 
The number of both central and obstructive events 
recorded from group I and II infants remained significantly 
higher than that of the control infants (P , 0.05, 
ANOVA). Control infants had a similar number of 
central apneas recorded during both diagnostic studies, 
and, although the number of obstructive events was 
low, the obstructive apnea index was significantly 
reduced during the second diagnostic study (Table 2). 

The sleep disordered breathing of group I and II 
infants was associated with differences in the sleeping 
architecture. Infants of groups I and II had significantly 
less REM sleep than did the control infants 
during both diagnostic studies (P , 0.05, ANOVA). The 
treatment of OSA in group I infants with CPAP, however, 
was associated with a significant increase in the 
amount of REM sleep, similar to that recorded in the 
control infants (P , 0.05, t-test; Table 2). 

Arousal Pattern 

Respiratory arousals. The central and obstructive 
apneas recorded in group I and II infants were sometimes 
terminated or immediately followed by a brief 
cortical arousal from sleep (Fig. 1). The majority of 
apneas during the first diagnostic study for both groups 
of infants, however, were resolved without any change 
in EEG patterns during NREM and REM sleep (Fig. 2). 
Arousals terminating apneas during the diagnostic 
studies in the control infants occurred occasionally. The 
respiratory arousal index during NREM sleep in the 
first diagnostic study was 3.9 6 1.0, 3.0 6 0.6, and 0.3 6 

0.1 arousals/h for group I, group II, and control infants, 
respectively. During REM sleep, the respiratory arousal 
index was 5.7 6 1.1, 5.5 6 1.0, and 1.4 6 0.5 arousals/h 
for group I, group II, and control infants, respectively. 
Respiratory arousals were significantly less frequent in 
control infants than in the two groups of OSA infants 
during both sleep states; however, controls had fewer 
apneas than did group I and II infants (P , 0.05, 
ANOVA). 
During the follow-up diagnostic study, the respiratory 
arousal index was similarly low for all infants of 
groups I and II during NREM and REM sleep and was 
still significantly lower in control infants than in OSA 
infants (P , 0.05, ANOVA). During NREM sleep, the

respiratory arousal index was 2.7 6 0.6, 1.9 6 0.3, and

arousal index was 6.3 6 1.1, 3.6 6 0.8, and 0.6 6 
0.3 arousals/h for group I, group II, and control infants, 
respectively. The respiratory arousal index during 
NREM and REM sleep for each group of infants was not 
significantly different from the first diagnostic study 
(P . 0.05 for each comparison, t-test).

similar during both diagnostic studies, the apnea index

recorded during the follow-up studies had decreased. 
During NREM sleep, the proportion of apneas that 
resulted in arousal was similar to the previous diagnostic 
study, and there was no difference between groups I 
and II (Fig. 3). During REM sleep, however, the proportion 
of apneas that was terminated by arousals in group 
I infants significantly increased during the follow-up 
study, i.e., during the first night of CPAP removal (P , 
0.05, t-test). The percentage of apneas terminated with 
arousal during REM sleep was approximately double 
that of the previous diagnostic study (Fig. 4). In group 
II infants during REM sleep, however, there was no 
significant change in the proportion of apneas terminated 
by an arousal during REM sleep (Fig. 4). The 
increase in the proportion of apneas ending in arousal 
in group I infants was due to an increase in respiratory 
arousals after both central and obstructive apneas. The 
respiratory arousals after central apnea increased from 

3.5 6 0.3 to 11.7 6 1.2% of apneas, and the respiratory 
arousals associated with obstructive apnea increased

Respiratory arousals in the control infants were less 
frequent than in infants of groups I and II; however, the 
controls aroused frequently to their occasional obstructive 
events. During the first diagnostic study, 2 of 6 and 
9 of 22 obstructive apneas were terminated by an 
arousal during NREM and REM sleep, respectively. 
During the follow-up diagnostic study of the control 
infants, there were no obstructive events during NREM 
sleep; however, during REM sleep one of five obstructive 
apneas was terminated by an arousal. The proportion 
of obstructive apneas that were terminated by an 
arousal in both studies was greater than that recorded 
in the infants with OSA; however, because of the low 
number of obstructive events recorded during the control 
infant studies, compared with group I and II 
infants, no statistical analysis was performed. 

Spontaneous arousals. Spontaneous arousals occurred 
in all infants studied during NREM and REM 
sleep and varied from brief arousals to full sustained 
awakenings. During the first diagnostic study, the 
spontaneous arousal index during NREM sleep was 
similar for all three groups of infants. During REM 
sleep, however, the infants of groups I and II had 
significantly fewer spontaneous arousals than did the 
control infants (P , 0.05, ANOVA; Table 4). 

The treatment of OSA with nasal CPAP in group I 
infants resulted in a significant increase in the spontaneous 
arousals during REM sleep (P , 0.05, t-test). The 
frequency of REM spontaneous arousals during CPAP 
treatment was similar to the number recorded during 
REM sleep in the first diagnostic study in the control 
infants. During NREM sleep, the frequency of spontaneous 
arousals was not different during treatment with 
nasal CPAP (Table 4). 

The spontaneous arousal index during NREM and 
REM sleep in the follow-up diagnostic studies ,7wk

arousals during NREM and REM sleep compared with 
their first diagnostic study. The control infants, on the

DISCUSSION 

Our study has revealed new findings on the interaction 
between OSA and arousal in infants and the effects 
of nasal CPAP treatment on the infant arousal response. 
Nasal-mask CPAP is the treatment of choice for 
the adult OSA syndrome (28) and is now commonly 
used in the treatment of OSA in children (15, 30). Nasal 
CPAP has been used less often in infants but has been 
documented to effectively prevent obstructive events 
and reverse sleep disturbances in infants with OSA (8, 
17). The present study has reaffirmed the effectiveness 
of nasal CPAP as a therapy to treat OSA in infants. 
More importantly, it is now clear that the spontaneous 
and respiratory arousal patterns during REM sleep are 
possibly depressed in infants who have OSA, and 
arousal responses are increased by the treatment of 
OSA with nasal CPAP. 

The infants in the present study who had OSA had 
reduced respiratory and spontaneous arousals during 
REM sleep. Arousal from sleep is considered to be an 
important response to a respiratory stimulus, allowing 
an individual to initiate protective reflexes that are 
depressed or absent during sleep (22). The OSA syndrome 
in adults is characterized by repeated episodes 
of obstructive apnea resulting in repeated arousal from 
sleep (27). Arousal was previously thought to be necessary 
to terminate obstructive apneas and to reestablish 
upper airway patency (25). It has been demonstrated 
recently, however, that arousal defined by EEG criteria 
does not always terminate obstructive apnea in adults 

(24) and in pediatric patients (18). It is possible that the 
termination of obstructive and central apneas without 
any clear EEG arousal may indicate that cortical 
arousal is not an important phenomenon to resolve 
apnea, and subcortical mechanisms may be necessary 
(3, 18). 
Arousal in our infants could be depressed, or the 
arousal threshold may be increased as a consequence of 
the OSA. Adult OSA patients have been shown to have 
higher arousal thresholds compared with control subjects 
(13). Potential explanations suggested for the 
difference in arousability between OSA patients and 
control subjects have included an inherently higher 
arousal threshold in patients with OSA or the consequence 
of repeated obstructive apnea, resulting in the 
habituation of the arousal response (3). In the present 
study, although no statistical analysis was performed, 
the arousability to obstructive apnea in the control 
infants appeared to be higher than in the infants with 
OSA. The control infants aroused more often to occasional 
obstructive events during NREM and REM sleep 
than did infants who had significant OSA. Although we 
cannot be certain of the mechanism, the respiratory 
arousal responses of infants with OSA are likely depressed. 


After several weeks of nasal CPAP treatment, withdrawal 
of CPAP treatment for one night resulted in a 
return of significant obstructive and central apnea 
during NREM and REM sleep and an increase in the 
arousability to central and obstructive apnea during 
REM sleep in infants with OSA. Similar to our findings, 
the removal of CPAP treatment in adults is followed by 
a return of apnea, the associated hypoxemic episodes, 
and sleep fragmentation (14). The number of apneas 
was smaller than the level initially recorded; however, 
there was a similar reduction in apnea in group II 
infants who were not treated with nasal CPAP. The 
improvement in apnea severity was possibly a consequence 
of increasing age and development, because 
OSA in infants has been shown to diminish with age 
(19). Recently, some investigators have demonstrated 
changes in the arousability to respiratory stimuli in 
adult OSA patients after treatment with nasal CPAP. 
Berry et al. (4) found that, after withdrawal of CPAP, 
the arousal response to nasal occlusion occurred more 
rapidly than that measured before treatment. In a 
separate study, Boudewyns et al. (5) found that, on the 
first night of CPAP withdrawal, apnea duration was 
shorter and arousal occurred more quickly compared 
with the pretreatment values. Both of these studies 
imply that OSA impairs the arousal response, which 
can at least be partially reversed by CPAP treatment. 
Recently, Marcus et al. (16) found that the arousal 
threshold to respiratory stimuli was higher in children 
with OSA than in controls and that treatment of OSA 
with adenotonsillectomy resulted in a decreased arousal 
threshold. These investigators suggested that the 
blunted arousal response in these children was secondary 
to OSA. The increase in the proportion of apneas 
that were terminated by an arousal on the first night of 
CPAP withdrawal suggests that the decreased arousability 
is possibly secondary to OSA in infants and can 
be partly reversed by prevention of the sleep-disordered 
breathing with CPAP treatment. 

The spontaneous arousability was also depressed 
during REM sleep in infants with OSA. Although the 
arousals occurred at a similar frequency between infants 
with OSA and control infants during NREM 
sleep, the number of spontaneous arousals during REM 
sleep was smaller in both groups of infants with OSA 
than in controls. This is consistent with our previous 
findings in which we found a selective depression of 
spontaneous arousals during REM sleep associated 
with OSA in infants (18). Also similar to our previous 
findings, OSA in infants was associated with a reduced 
amount of REM sleep (19). When nasal CPAP was used 
to treat the OSA in some infants, the number of 
spontaneous arousals during REM sleep increased to a 
similar level as that measured in the control infants. 
Nasal CPAP therapy prevented obstructive events and 
increased the amount of REM sleep in these infants. 
The improvement in the frequency of spontaneous 
arousals during REM sleep to a level similar to the 
controls during CPAP treatment suggests that the 
decrease in spontaneous arousability is secondary to 
the sleep-disordered breathing. The increase in sponta-

neous arousals during CPAP therapy could be related 
to the elimination of obstructive apnea or the normalization 
of REM sleep architecture. 

The depression of spontaneous as well as respiratory 
arousal responsiveness in infants with OSA was only 
apparent during REM sleep. In contrast, arousal responses 
during NREM sleep were similar between both 
groups of infants with OSA and infants with normal 
breathing during sleep. Previous studies investigating 
the arousal responsiveness in neonatal animal models 
have found that depression of arousal often occurs more 
readily during REM sleep than NREM sleep. Fewell et 
al. (7) demonstrated in a lamb model that repeated 
upper airway obstruction resulted in a depression of 
the arousal response only during REM sleep. In addition, 
Johnston et al. (11) showed that repetitive hypoxia 
in lambs resulted in a depression of arousal and that 
the arousal decrement was first apparent in REM 
sleep. Furthermore, other investigators demonstrated 
that the arousal threshold to airway obstruction in 
lambs was shown to be greater during REM sleep than 
during NREM sleep, leading to a possible increased 
vulnerability during this sleep state (2, 9). These 
studies suggest that the primary mechanisms initiating 
arousal from NREM and REM sleep are different. 
The sleep-state-specific arousal depression in the present 
study, as well as others, suggests that the possibility 
of arousal failure is greater in REM sleep than in 
NREM sleep. Infants spend a greater proportion of 
sleep in REM sleep than do children or adults, and 
REM sleep in infants is believed to be important for 
brain growth and development (20). Although there 
may be a combination of factors, the depression of 
arousal responsiveness during REM sleep may, therefore, 
have been caused by an increasing drive to 
preserve REM sleep. 

The difference in the spontaneous and respiratory 
arousal frequency between infants with OSA and normal 
infants in the present study is interesting considering 
the previous polysomnographic and pneumogram 
findings of infants who subsequently became SIDS 
victims (12, 26). It was demonstrated that SIDS infants 
have more frequent obstructive events during sleep 
than do age-matched controls, suggesting that OSA 
may predispose an infant to SIDS (12). In addition, a 
further finding from both of the previous studies was a 
reduced amount of movement activity during sleep in 
infants who subsequently became SIDS victims than in 
matched controls (12, 26). It is possible that the movements 
recorded were associated with arousal behavior 
in these infants, and a reduced number of movements 
could, therefore, imply a reduced number of arousals. 
Furthermore, some investigators have suggested that 
recovery from an asphyxiating stimulus by arousal or 
resumption of breathing is the crucial vulnerability of 
SIDS victims (10, 22). The depression of arousal responses 
from REM sleep associated with OSA in infants 
allows us to speculate that these findings could 
have implications for an increased risk of SIDS in such 
infants. 

The present study has provided information on the 
arousal responses and their changes with development 
in infants with normal sleep and breathing patterns 
and infants with OSA who are left untreated. Although 
arousal responses in infants to various chemical and 
mechanical stimuli have been studied (7, 9, 11), the 
natural arousal pattern and its changes with development 
have not previously been reported. The main 
finding was that the number of spontaneous arousals 
during REM sleep decreased with age in the control 
infants and remained the same for the OSA infants. 
During the follow-up diagnostic study, the spontaneous 
arousal frequency was not different, however, among 
the three groups of infants. Spontaneous arousals are 
very frequent during REM sleep in normal young 
infants (18); however, it appears that their importance 
possibly diminishes with time. Although OSA appears 
to depress spontaneous arousals during REM sleep in 
young infants, this effect is likely diminished with 
development. In contrast, the frequency of respiratory 
arousals in infants with OSA did not change with age. 
In infants whose OSA was left untreated, the arousability 
to respiratory events was unchanged with development, 
despite an improvement in their apnea index. It 
is possible that these infants will continue to have 
reduced arousal responses until their OSA is resolved 
with development. 

This study has shown that the spontaneous and 
respiratory arousals during REM sleep are possibly 
depressed in infants who have OSA compared with 
infants with normal breathing patterns during sleep. 
Treatment of OSA with nasal CPAP improves the REM 
sleep spontaneous arousal pattern, and the immediate 
withdrawal of CPAP leads to increased respiratory 
arousals in response to central and obstructive apneas 
during REM sleep. We believe that the OSA and its 
associated sleep disturbances in infants alter and possibly 
impair the spontaneous and respiratory arousal 
responses during REM sleep. The depression in arousability 
is partially reversed by the treatment of OSA by 
using nasal CPAP treatment. The state-specific changes 
in arousal responses in infants with OSA imply that 
infants may be more vulnerable to a life-threatening 
stimulus during REM sleep and that treatment of the 
OSA may protect an infant from such a stimulus.
