Abstract 

Study Objectives: To compare a validated subjective measure of childhood sleepiness to an objective 
determination, assess the frequency of problematic sleepiness among children with suspected sleep-
disordered breathing (SDB), and examine what standard or investigational polysomnographic 
measures of SDB predict subjective sleepiness. 

Design: Prospective, cross-sectional 

Setting: University-based sleep disorders laboratory 

Participants: Washtenaw County Adenotonsillectomy Cohort 

Intervention: Polysomnography followed by Multiple Sleep Latency Tests in 103 children 5-12 years 
old: 77 were scheduled for clinically-indicated adenotonsillectomy, usually for suspected SDB, and 
26 for unrelated surgical care. Parents completed the previously-validated, 4-item Pediatric Sleep 
Questionnaire–Sleepiness Subscale (PSQ-SS). 

Results: Thirty-three (43%) of the adenotonsillectomy children had high PSQ-SS scores, in 
comparison to only 3 (12%) of the controls (p=0.004). The PSQ-SS scores correlated inversely with 
mean sleep latencies on the Multiple Sleep Latency Tests (rho=-0.23, p=0.006). The obstructive 
apnea index, apnea/hypopnea index, and respiratory disturbance index (which included respiratory 
event-related arousals identified by esophageal pressure monitoring) each correlated similarly with

PSQ-SS scores, as did investigational quantification of esophageal pressures and respiratory cycle-
related EEG changes (each rho˜0.30, p<0.02). A stepwise regression identified sigma-frequency 
respiratory cycle-related EEG changes as the strongest independent predictor of subjective sleepiness 
among all subjects, and particularly those without obstructive sleep apnea. 

Conclusions: Sleepiness is a frequent problem among children with suspected SDB. Subjective 
sleepiness (PSQ-SS) reflects Multiple Sleep Latency Test results to a limited extent, as in adults. 
Standard polysomnographic measures of SDB predict subjective sleepiness, but respiratory cycle-
related EEG changes may offer additional clinical utility.

INTRODUCTION 

Among the consequences of childhood sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), sleepiness is often 
downplayed in comparison to other neurobehavioral outcomes.1 One recent study, however, 
confirmed that children with obstructive sleep apnea, in comparison to those without SDB, had 
shorter mean sleep latencies on a research version of the Multiple Sleep Latency Test that uses 
30-minute nap opportunities.2 In another study, standard clinical Multiple Sleep Latency Tests 
before and after adenotonsillectomy (AT) or other surgical care showed that the AT children 
had shorter mean sleep latencies before the surgery, but not one year later.3 Behavioral and 
cognitive measures similarly differed between groups and improved after AT, but only daytime 
sleepiness showed significant association with baseline SDB severity, and only daytime 
sleepiness changed after AT in parallel to the SDB measures. These findings combine to 
suggest that sleepiness may be a more important feature of childhood SDB than previously 
thought. 

Subjective sleepiness in children has received less scrutiny than objectively-measured 
sleepiness. In adults, subjective and objective sleepiness can differ substantially.4,5 School-
aged children with snoring and other symptoms of SDB clearly can show subjective sleepiness 
as well.6 Part of the reason why available data are limited is that subjective measures of 
sleepiness have not been as extensively developed, validated, and studied in children as in 
adults. 

At least three instruments to assess subjective sleepiness in children have been described and 
validated in some manner. The sleepiness subscale within the parent-completed Pediatric Sleep 
Questionnaire distinguishes referred children with polysomnographically-confirmed SDB 
from control children recruited in general pediatrics waiting rooms.7 High scores on the self-
administered Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale correspond with low school achievement, 
absenteeism, and diminished sleep time among middle-school students.8 The parent-
completed Epworth Sleepiness Scale, modified for children, distinguishes patients studied for 
suspected SDB from controls, though not children with sleep apnea from those with primary 
snoring.9 None of these three instruments has been validated against the gold-standard 
objective test for sleepiness, the Multiple Sleep Latency Test. Furthermore, only one study has 
explored the extent to which objective polysomnographic measures of SDB severity predict 
subjective sleepiness.9 Such information might advance understanding of how this symptom 
arises in childhood SDB.

METHODS 
Subjects 

Subjects were children aged 5.0 – 12.9 years enrolled in the Washtenaw County 
Adenotonsillectomy Cohort, a study of neurobehavioral outcomes in pediatric SDB.3 A parent 
signed an informed consent and the child assented to participate in this IRB-approved protocol. 
Inclusion criteria included 1) scheduled AT or other surgical care (often hernia repair, 
sometimes only a non-otolaryngology surgical office visit), 2) no clinical need for a 
polysomnogram as judged by treating otolaryngologists (most of whom rarely obtain sleep 
studies prior to AT), and 3) absence of medical conditions that would impede performance or 
interpretation of sleep and behavioral testing. The AT could be scheduled for any clinical 
indication, but the treating otolaryngologists for almost all the participants (91%) indicated 
that the indication for surgery was, at least in part, an office-based diagnosis of nocturnal airway 
obstruction. Additional details of the recruitment procedures and protocol have been described 
elsewhere.3 

The number of families approached about the study in otolaryngology and other surgical clinics 
was approximately 735. The study enrolled 105 children, of which 103 form the basis for the 
current report. Two subjects were excluded because technical limitations within their digitally-
recorded sleep studies did not allow computation of a key measure based on spectral analysis 
(see below). The 103 subjects had a mean age of 8.4 ± 1.9 years and 59 were boys. Among the 
103 subjects, 77 were scheduled for AT and 26 for other surgical care. Ethnic and racial 
backgrounds included Caucasian/non-Hispanic (84 subjects), African-American (10), 
Hispanic (4), and other groups (5). Comparisons between participants and larger samples of 
non-participants suggested no significant differences between groups in gender, racial 
distribution, socioeconomic status, history of chronic tonsillitis, snoring frequency, or 
witnessed apneas.3 Participants were older than non-participants, by less than one year on 
average. Parents of AT participants, in comparison to non-participants, more frequently had 
behavioral concerns about their children (56% vs. 40%), but no such difference was observed 
among control participants and non-participants (15% vs. 15%). 

Polysomnography 

Each child and accompanying parent were admitted to a private room in the Michael S. Aldrich 
Sleep Disorders Laboratory between December, 1999, and December, 2002. Polysomnography 
included all standard leads required to score sleep stages.10 Breathing was monitored with 
oronasal thermocouples, chest and abdominal excursion with piezoelectric strain gauges, 
oxygen saturation by finger oximetry, end-tidal CO2 by pediatric nasal cannula, and esophageal 
pressure through a thin water-filled catheter previously shown to have a negligible effect on 
sleep in children.11,12 About 1/4 of the children did not tolerate esophageal pressure 
monitoring for at least 2 hours, and their data for relevant variables were considered missing.
13 On the day after the nocturnal polysomnogram, a Multiple Sleep Latency Test was 
performed. This included 4 or 5 twenty-minute nap attempts at 2-hour intervals, and followed 
a standard clinical protocol.14 

Scoring was performed by an experienced, registered polysomnographic technician who was 
masked to identity and clinical status of the subjects.10 For the Multiple Sleep Latency Tests, 
the latency to the first epoch of stage 1 sleep was calculated on each nap attempt and the mean 
sleep latency was computed across all naps, assigning 20 minutes for those periods in which 
no sleep was obtained. Nocturnal polysomnographic measures of SDB severity included 
standard variables as well as several that appear less commonly in clinical practice but were 
considered to be promising investigational measures. The variables used were obstructive 
apnea index, apnea/hypopnea index, respiratory disturbance index, minimum oxygen

saturation, EEG arousal index, percent sleep time with end-tidal CO2 > 50 mm Hg, most 
negative esophageal pressure, percent of sleep time with esophageal pressure more negative 
than -10 cm water, and respiratory cycle-related EEG changes. The definition, rationale, and 
limitations for each variable are listed in the Appendix. 

Subjective Sleepiness 

Subjective sleepiness was assessed with the 4-item Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire -- Sleepiness 
Subscale (PSQ-SS).7 These items ask a parent, who is encouraged to ask the child for help, 
whether the subject 1) wakes up feeling unrefreshed in the morning, 2) has a problem with 
sleepiness during the day, 3) appears sleepy during the day according to comments of a teacher 
or other supervisor, or 4) is hard to wake up in the morning. Responses are Yes, No, or Don't 
Know. In initial tests of validity, each item individually distinguished children with SDB from 
controls.7 The mean response (Yes = 1, No = 0, Don't Know = missing) among the available 
items is the score for the subscale. Previous data on the 22-item PSQ Sleep-Related Breathing 
Disorder score, which includes the PSQ-SS, suggested that a cut-off of 0.33 would be most 
effective. A similar threshold (PSQ = 0.33) was used in the current study of the PSQ-SS to 
identify subjective sleepiness. By this criterion, a child whose parent answered all question-
items would have to suffer from at least 2 of 4 sleepiness symptoms to be classified as 
subjectively sleepy. 

Analysis 

Data were double-entered (to verify accuracy) into a SAS database (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) 
by a professional data entry company. Means and standard deviations were used as summary 
measures, and medians were also computed for the non-continuous PSQ-SS scores. The non-
parametric Spearman correlation rho was used initially to test associations between subjective 
sleepiness (PSQ-SS scores) and each polysomnographic variable. Multiple stepwise logistic 
regression was then used to account for co-linearity of the polysomnographic variables and 
identify which few were the best independent predictors of subjective sleepiness. A model that 
included the best identified predictor, along with apnea/hypopnea index (the most commonly-
used single measure of SDB severity) was also tested, both with and without adjustment for 
age, sex, and body mass index (kg/m2). This model was also tested separately among subjects 
with and without obstructive sleep apnea, as defined by an obstructive apnea index = 1.15 

RESULTS 
Subjective Sleepiness 

The mean PSQ-SS score among all 103 subjects was 0.28 ± 0.32 (s.d.), and the median was 

0.25. Among the 77 AT subjects, the mean was 0.35 ± 0.33 (median 0.25), whereas among the 
26 control subjects the mean was 0.09 ± 0.19 (median 0.00). The difference between groups 
was statistically significant (Mann-Whitney U test, p = 0.0002). Figure 1 shows the distribution 
of the PSQ-SS scores among all the subjects, the AT subjects, and the control subjects. A total 
of 36 (35%) of all subjects had a PSQ-SS score = 0.33 and were classified for the purpose of 
dichotomous analyses as having problematic subjective sleepiness: these included 33 (43%) 
of the children in the AT group and 3 (12%) of those in the control group (X2=8.39, p=0.004). 
Polysomnographic measures of SDB for the entire sample, the 36 subjectively sleepy subjects, 
and the 67 more alert subjects are shown in Table 1. 
Comparison of Subjective and Objective Sleepiness 

The mean sleep latency on the Multiple Sleep Latency Tests averaged 16.5 ± 3.3 minutes. The 
PSQ-SS correlated inversely but not strongly with the mean sleep latency on the Multiple Sleep 
Latency Test (rho=-0.23, p=0.018; Figure 2). The correlation was stronger within the subgroup

of AT subjects (n=39) who had obstructive sleep apnea (average of mean sleep latencies = 15.6 
± 3.6, rho=-0.43, p=0.006). 

Polysomnographic Correlates of Subjective Sleepiness 

Apneic event rates, esophageal pressures, and high-frequency RCREC proved to be the best 
predictors of subjective sleepiness in initial bivariate non-parametric correlations (Table 2). 
Stepwise logistic regression in which all Table 2 polysomnographic measures could be entered 
(n = 70 subjects with data for each) retained only two predictor variables in the final model, 
sigma RCREC and alpha RCREC. A single standard deviation increase in either variable was 
independently associated with a 2-fold increase in probability of subjective sleepiness, and the 
model explained 26% of the variance in subjective sleepiness (Table 3). Log-transformation 
of the skewed obstructive apnea index, apnea/hypopnea index, or respiratory disturbance index 
did not have a large impact on their level of significance. Examination of all-possible subset 
models with 2 explanatory variables allowed, with or without the log-transforms, showed that 
the 4 best models always retained sigma RCREC but that alpha RCREC could be replaced by 
any of the apnea indices without sizeable change in significance of the overall model. In a 
logistic regression model that forced inclusion of the apnea/hypopnea index along with sigma 
RCREC (n=103), each variable retained significance after adjusting for the other (Table 4). 
Adjustment for age, gender, and body mass index did not substantially alter these results. 

Correlates in Children With and Without Obstructive Sleep Apnea 

Among the 39 AT children with sleep apnea, the mean apnea/hypopnea index was 13.3 ± 15.5, 
and 19 (49%) had subjective sleepiness. Subjective sleepiness as an outcome in simple logistic 
regression models was predicted by the normalized apnea/hypopnea index (OR = 2.6 [1.0, 6.8]) 
but not sigma RCREC (OR = 1.3 [0.6, 2.9]). 

Among the 64 children who were either controls or AT subjects without sleep apnea, the mean 
apnea/hypopnea index was 1.2 ± 1.4 (equivalent to that among controls alone3), and 17 (27%) 
had subjective sleepiness. In simple logistic regression models, subjective sleepiness was 
predicted by normalized sigma RCREC (OR = 2.5 [1.3, 4.7]) but not by apnea/hypopnea index 
(OR = 1.1 [0.1, 83.2]). Models that adjusted for age, gender, and body mass index showed 
essentially unchanged results for the 39 AT children with sleep apnea and the 64 remaining 
subjects. 

DISCUSSION 

This study of 103 children aged 5 to 12 years used a previously-validated, parent-generated 
subjective sleepiness scale to show that patients scheduled for AT, in contrast to controls, 
frequently have problems with daytime sleepiness. Comparison of PSQ-SS scores to results 
of concurrent Multiple Sleep Latency Tests demonstrated for the first time that a subjective 
rating of childhood sleepiness corresponded with an objective gold-standard. Comparison of 
the PSQ-SS scores to results of nocturnal polysomnography showed that several standard sleep 
laboratory measures predicted subjective sleepiness levels to a moderate degree. One of the 
best polysomnographic correlates of subjective sleepiness was sigma RCREC, a recently-
developed measure of the extent to which EEG spectral power during non-apneic sleep varies 
in synchrony with the respiratory cycle. The new measure was particularly helpful among those 
subjects whose apnea/hypopnea index was too low to be informative. 

Among children scheduled to have AT, usually for suspected SDB, 43% met study criteria for 
subjective sleepiness. In most cases this meant that parents endorsed at least two of four specific 
sleepiness symptoms. Similarly, another study of children with suspected SDB found that 28% 
(vs. only 12% of controls) met adult criteria for subjective daytime sleepiness on a slightly-

modified Epworth Sleepiness Scale.9 To the extent that sleepiness is not as readily evident 
among children as it is among adults,16 more subjects in that study might have qualified as 
sleepy had an age-adjusted cut-off been used. The Epworth already enjoys widespread use for 
adult patients. However, possible advantages of the shorter PSQ-SS are that it includes 
questions more specific to children, assesses the degree to which sleepiness is a problem (rather 
than just sleep propensity in different situations), and reflects input of parents and teachers who 
are in the best positions to observe child behavior. 

Another advantage of the PSQ-SS is that it has now been validated against an objective measure 
of sleepiness, the Multiple Sleep Latency Test. The magnitude of association between the two 
measures was only low to moderate, but entirely consistent with existing data that have 
compared subjective and objective measures of sleepiness in adult patients.4 In fact, two of 
the largest published clinical series of adults with suspected SDB found no significant 
association between Epworth and Multiple Sleep Latency Test scores.5,17 

Our study also demonstrated statistically-significant associations between several standard 
nocturnal polysomnographic variables and subjective sleepiness. Again these associations 
were not particularly robust, but they were as strong or stronger than those reported previously 
in adults studied for suspected SDB.5 In the Sleep Heart Health Study, for example, the patients 
with the most severe sleep apnea showed Epworth scores only 2 points higher (on a scale of 0 

– 24) than those without sleep apnea.18 
In an attempt to examine the potential for added clinical utility of esophageal pressure 
monitoring in children, we used this technique successfully in most subjects to identify 
respiratory event-related arousals (RERAs).19,20 About 1/4 of our subjects did not tolerate 
esophageal pressure monitoring,13 but in clinical practice pediatric patients are not research 
volunteers and failure to tolerate the procedure is rare.12 In any case, the addition of RERAs 
to apneas and hypopneas (within an overall respiratory disturbance index) did not, in fact, 
identify many events missed by relatively sensitive but justifiable criteria for pediatric 
hypopneas (Table 1).19,21,22 Therefore, the ability to predict subjective sleepiness was not 
greater for the respiratory disturbance index in comparison to the simpler apnea/hypopnea 
index. This is shown in Table 2, where the small difference between the two indices arose 
mainly from the slight difference in samples (n=74 vs. n=103). In contrast, the addition of 
hypopneas to the obstructive apnea index more than doubled the number of events (Table 1), 
but surprisingly contributed essentially nothing to the ability to predict the outcome under 
study, namely subjective sleepiness (Table 2). 

This analysis is among the first to show that the highly-correlated obstructive apnea, apnea/ 
hypopnea, and respiratory disturbance indices may not provide different clinical utility. Nasal 
pressure monitoring may serve as a surrogate measure when esophageal pressure is not 
available,19 and may identify a larger number of subtle respiratory events than thermistors do 
in children.23 However, the one pediatric study that tested the association between hypopnea 
rates determined by nasal pressure and thermistors found a near-perfect correlation (r=0.94).
24 If our findings are confirmed in studies of outcomes other than subjective sleepiness, the 
implication for clinical practice is that continued efforts to identify increasingly subtle apneic 
events, or their induced cortical and subcortical arousals, may provide only diminishing returns. 
An adequate understanding of how outcomes relate to the thermistor-derived obstructive apnea 
index, for example, could show this simple measure to be about as useful as more elaborate 
methods that identify many more apneic events. 

On the other hand, entirely new approaches that are not based on apneic events or associated 
arousals may provide new, incremental utility in polysomnography. Our study explored two 
types of new approaches. One was based on respiratory effort, which is suspected to be the

cause of arousals that terminate apneas and hypopneas.25 The other was based on a recently-
developed measure (RCREC) of the extent to which cerebral cortical activity, as reflected by 
the EEG, varies in concert with the respiratory cycle during non-apneic sleep. The clinical 
utility of the new esophageal pressure measures -- the most negative esophageal pressure 
recorded and the percent of sleep time spent with esophageal pressures more negative than -10 
cm of water – has not been tested previously to our knowledge in children or adults. Our 
findings suggested good clinical utility, but could not show incremental utility above that 
already provided by standard indices of apneic events. 

In contrast, RCREC in high frequency bands may provide incremental utility as they clearly 
predicted subjective sleepiness independently of the standard respiratory indices we tested. 
These findings parallel those recently published for a series of adults studied for suspected 
SDB: sigma RCREC predicted next-day Multiple Sleep Latency Test results more robustly 
than did the apnea/hypopnea index or any other standard polysomnographic measure.26 During 
an average non-apneic inspiration, sigma power increased and delta power decreased, and this 
tendency was accentuated in patients who were excessively sleepy.26 These data, in 
combination with the results of the current study, support the idea that RCREC may represent 
transient, subtle, but numerous inspiratory microarousals enhanced or provoked during labored 
non-apneic breathing. As most SDB patients spend only a minority of their sleep time actually 
within an apnea or hypopnea, RCREC may be a useful measure of a physiological process that 
contributes to sleepiness incompletely explained by the frequency of apneic events. Our data 
suggest that RCREC may be particularly useful in primary snoring, when apneas and 
hypopneas cannot be detected but neurobehavioral morbidity can still arise.9,27-29 

Among the limitations of this study, the non-randomized design was necessary because of the 
desire to assess long-term outcomes without ethical barriers that might arise if some subjects 
with SDB had to forego AT. Participants in the cohort resembled non-participants in most 
respects,3 but potential effects of selection bias cannot be excluded. The age range of the 
subjects (8 years) raises the possibility that the PSQ-SS may have functioned differently for 
the youngest and oldest participants. However, the PSQ-SS was designed to include items 
relevant to both younger and older children. The instrument did not show sensitivity to age in 
a previous validation study that enrolled 2 – 18 year-olds,7 and taking age into account in the 
current analysis did not change results of the logistic regression models. In older children, a 
self-administered sleepiness questionnaire might be more effective than a parental survey, but 
one previous study that compared both approaches in children aged 6 to 18 years found good 
correlation between results obtained either way (r=0.71).9 Although the PSQ-SS showed clear 
associations with Multiple Sleep Latency Test scores, the discrepancy between the two 
measures was sufficiently large to suggest that in clinical practice, one test should not substitute 
for the other. This study could not possibly examine simultaneously all polysomnographic 
methods available that may help to understand subjective sleepiness. In particular, nasal 
pressure monitoring was not performed, and neither were largely-investigational but promising 
techniques to assess autonomic arousals30-32 or the cyclic alternating pattern.33,34 Finally, 
this study did not examine non-neurobehavioral SDB morbidity, which could show different 
associations with polysomnographic SDB measures. 

In conclusion, results of this study suggest that the traditional message about the scarcity of 
sleepiness in pediatric SDB could be refined. Inattention, hyperactivity, or other 
neurobehavioral manifestations may be more obvious, but subjective daytime sleepiness is also 
frequently a problem that can be elicited by a careful clinical history or use of the PSQ-SS. 
Standard polysomnographic measures can be informative about risk for daytime sleepiness, 
but only to a moderate extent. Identification of increasingly subtle apneic events or RERAs 
may not be necessary if additional studies, perhaps focused on other SDB consequences, also 
cannot show added clinical utility in head-to-head comparisons with simpler measures. Instead,

novel conceptual approaches to SDB, such as RCREC or others that also escape dependence 
on the frequency of apneic events, may provide missing information. Development of these 
new approaches could prove especially important to the large number of snoring children who 
may be symptomatic even in the absence of discrete apneic events.

Rationale for Use as Measure of SDB SeverityOne the most common and well-studied measures of pediatric SDB.15 
In comparison to hypopneas, apneas are more easily and reliably 
identified. Criteria for their definition, in comparison to those forhypopneas, are less variable between laboratories. Limitations: May not 
capture many more subtle obstructions of the upper airway that can still 
be associated with arousals, hypoxemia, and daytime morbidity.
Single most commonly-used measure of SDB severity. Addition of 
hypopneas to the apnea index supported by similar physiology, potential 
to precede arousal, and observation that some patients with clinicaldiagnosis of sleep apnea have mainly hypopneas rather than apneas.36 
In adults, each hypopnea contributes to measured daytime sleepiness 
about the same amount on average as each apnea, though with increasedvariability.37 Limitations: Definitions of pediatric hypopneas are less 
well defined and accepted than those for apneas.38 Available data on 
normal children are limited.39 
Respiratory disturbance index 
(Established measure, but usedonly to a variable extent in clinical 
practice) 
Number of apneas, hypopneas, 
or respiratory event-relatedarousals (RERAs 19) per hour of 
sleep. RERAs scored when, in 
the absence of an apnea orhypopnea, esophageal pressures 
over 5 consecutive breaths 
gradually became more negative(by at least 5 cm of water) just 
prior to arousal. 
Patients with upper airway resistance syndrome, a form of obstructive 
SDB, have increased upper airway resistance and work of breathing butessentially no apneas or readily-detected hypopneas.40 Instead, 
sequences of gradually increasing effort lead to arousals. Associated 
symptoms include daytime sleepiness in adults20 and other 
neurobehavioral morbidity in children.40 Studies in snoring children 
that have found such morbidity in the absence of apneas and hypopneas 
often have noted that the findings could have arisen by inadvertentinclusion of subjects with RERAs whose upper airway resistance 
syndrome was not detected.9,27,41 Limitations: The number of breaths, 
amount of negative pressure increase, and definition of arousals thatoptimally define RERAs are not well known. Some patients with steady, 
unchanging, excessively-negative esophageal pressures suffer from 
excessive daytime sleepiness, have no RERAs, but still respond totreatment for SDB.42

Helps to predict sleepiness in adults, even after adjustment for the apnea/ 
hypopnea index.37 Limitations: Derived from one time point only.
However, the measure is widely-used in clinical practice. Alternative 
proposals to use percent of sleep time spent below a variably-specified 
threshold saturation are not yet supported by evidence of improvedclinical utility. 
Arousals induced by respiratory events are widely believed to play a 
central role in SDB-associated sleepiness and behavioral morbidity.43 
Recent data support use of 3-second criteria, originally developed for 
adults, in children as well.44 Limitations: Apneas and hypopneas do not 
always cause visible EEG arousals. Non-visible arousals, detected insome cases only by autonomic measures or computer analysis of the 
EEG, may still cause daytime sleepiness.30,45,46 
Children with SDB may show obstructive hypoventilation.21 
Limitations: Few data are available to link this polysomnographic 
finding with outcomes.22 
Esophageal pressure provides a gold-standard assessment of respiratoryeffort during sleep.19 Increased respiratory effort is believed to be the 
cause of arousals in SDB.25 Limitations: Single point measure. Little 
previous work to link with outcomes.
As above, but derives from assessment throughout sleep period.
Limitations: No previous data linking this measure with outcomes.
