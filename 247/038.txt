Objective: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in children is frequently 
associated with growth interruption. The objective of this study was 
to evaluate the effect of OSAS and adenotonsillectomy on the insulin-like 
growth factor-I (IGF-I) axis in children. 

Study design: Thirteen prepubertal children (mean age, 6.0 ± 2.8 years) 
were studied before and after adenotonsillectomy (T&A). Weight, height, 
overnight polysomnography, and IGF-I and IGF-binding protein-3 levels 
were evaluated before and 3 to 12 months after T&A. The children’s 
weights and heights were monitored for 18 months. 

Results: The respiratory disturbance index improved from 7.8 ± 9.1 
events/h to 1.0 ± 2.1 events/h after T&A (P < .02). Slow-wave sleep increased 
from 29.1% ± 7.2% to 34.6% ± 9.8% after T&A (P < .02). The 
weight standard deviation score increased from 0.86 ± 1 to 1.24 ± 0.9, 18 
months after T&A (P < .01). Serum IGF-I levels increased from 146.3 ± 

76.2 ng/mL before T&A to 210.3 ± 112.5 ng/mL after surgery (P < .01), but 
IGF–binding protein-3 levels did not change significantly. 
Conclusion: The respiratory improvement after T&A in children with 
OSAS is associated with a significant increase in serum IGF-I levels and 
weight. We conclude that the IGF-I axis is affected in children with OSAS.

bance index of >1 obstructive event per

cause of OSAS in children is adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy. Thus adenotonsillectomy 
is the treatment of choice. A 
significant reduction in sleep disturbances 
after T&A has been reported, as 
well as catch-up growth.4-11 The prevalence 
of growth retardation in children 
with OSAS was estimated to be up to 
50%, although the prevalence is probably 
lower today, as a result of earlier diagnosis 
and treatment.7,8

The mechanism causing failure to 
thrive is unclear. Interruption of the 
growth hormone–insulin-like growth 
factor-I axis secondary to abnormal 
nocturnal GH secretion,12,13 low 
caloric intake caused by poor appetite 
and dysphagia,5,11 and high energy expenditure 
as a consequence of increased 
work of breathing during 
sleep6,14 have been proposed as causes. 

The purpose of this study was to clarify 
the relationship between OSAS in 
children and the potent growth factor 
IGF-I. Serum IGF-I and IGF–binding 
protein-3 (its main binding protein in 
the serum) are highly correlated with

the 24-hour mean GH levels and thus 
can be used as an index of the GH status.
15-17 We hypothesized that children 
with OSAS would exhibit significant 
improvement after T&A, with catch-up 
growth and increased serum IGF-I and 
IGFBP3 levels. 

METHODS 

Study Population 

Prepubertal children aged 1 to 11 
years were recruited. They were referred 
to the Sleep-Wake Disorders 
Unit because of signs and symptoms 
consistent with OSAS. The parents of 
51 children (of 85 who were approached) 
gave informed consent for 
their children to participate in the study. 
Thirty-three of these 51 children were 
diagnosed with OSAS and referred for 
T&A. The diagnosis of OSAS was 
based on a detailed clinical history obtained 
by using a standard question-
naire,18 physical examination, and sleep 
monitoring. Thirteen of the 33 children 
returned for a second sleep evaluation 
after T&A. There was no substantial 
difference between the children who attended 
the second sleep study and those 
who did not. Ten of the 13 patients returned 
for a full polysomnography, and 
3 had an overnight oximetry test. The 
decision not to perform a full PSG on 
the latter 3 children was not related to 
the severity of their clinical symptoms 
but was due to their inability to cooperate 
at the baseline PSG. Children with 
other chronic medical illnesses or facial 
anomalies were excluded. No sedation 
was used to induce sleep. The institutional 
ethics committee approved the 
study protocol. 

Polysomnographic Evaluation 

The children were studied before 
and 3 to 12 months after T&A. Two 
sleep studies, PSG (10 children) and 
overnight oximetry (3 children), were 
performed. 

OVERNIGHT POLYSOMNOGRAPHY. Thirteen 
signals were acquired by using a 

commercially available sleep monitoring 
system (SensorMedics Inc) and 
streamed through to an optical disk for 
later analysis. Signals were analyzed by 
computerized software, and the results 
were edited manually by a trained technician 
and by one of the investigators 
(A.B.). The following parameters were 
acquired: electroencephalogram—C4A1, 
C3A2; left and right electro-oculogram; 
left and right chin electromyogram; 
electrocardiogram—modified V2 lead; 
right tibialis electromyogram; snore (by 
a microphone); nasal and buccal airflow 
(by a thermistor); thoracic and abdominal 
movements (strain-gauges); SaO2 
by a pulse oximeter (Ohmeda 4700). 

OVERNIGHT OXIMETRY. When full PSG 
could not be carried out (non-cooperative 
patients), an attended overnight 
oximetry was conducted. The child 
slept at the sleep laboratory and was 
observed by the technician throughout 
the night, and SaO2 was measured continuously 
by a Biox 3700 pulse oximeter. 
The mean percent SaO2 during an 
8-hour sleep period and the percent 
time with SaO2 <90% during sleep 
were calculated automatically by using 
customized software.19 

Scoring 

SLEEP ARCHITECTURE. Sleep/wake and 
sleep stages during nocturnal sleep 
were scored by using the criteria of 
Rechtschaffen and Kales.20 Sleep latency, 
sleep efficiency, and indices of 
arousals and awakenings (events per 
hour of sleep) were calculated. 
Arousals and awakenings were scored 
according to the American Sleep Disorders 
Association task force recommendations 
with appropriate modifications 
for children.21 The sleep stage 
accumulative duration expresses the 
time spent in each sleep stage as a percent 
of the total sleeping time. 

RESPIRATORY PARAMETERS. Obstructive 
apneic and hypopneic events were 
scored according to the recommended 
pediatric criteria of the American Thoracic 
Society.22 Paradoxical breathing 
for at least 2 respiratory cycles with 
complete cessation of nasal airflow was 

defined as obstructive apnea. A hypopnea 
was scored if the paradoxical 
breathing was accompanied by a reduction 
of 50% in airflow, resulting in 
either an arousal or in oxygen desaturation 
of at least 4%. The RDI was calculated 
as the number of respiratory 
events (apnea/hypopnea) per hour of 
sleep. Paradoxical breathing time, an 
indication of increased upper airway 
resistance,23 was defined as the percentage 
of the total sleep time spent in 
paradoxical breathing. The desaturation 
index was calculated as the number 
of desaturation events (SaO2 decreased 
more than 4%) per hour of 
sleep. The percentage of time with a 
mean SaO2 below 90% was calculated 
and expressed as T90. 

Growth and Growth Factors 

Data for growth parameters were 
collected from the charts of the primary 
care clinics. Additional measurements 
were taken on arrival at the sleep 
laboratory and at 2 follow-up visits (3 
to 6 and 14 to 22 months after T&A). 

Venous blood samples were drawn 
for measurements of serum IGF-I and 
IGFBP3 on the mornings after the 
sleep studies (before and after T&A). 
The samples were centrifuged, frozen, 
and stored frozen at –20°C. 

SERUM IGF-I DETERMINATION. The determination 
of all serum IGF-I levels 
was performed in one assay. Two hundred 
fifty microliters of serum was 
added to 1 mL of 0.5 normal HCl, and 
IGF-binding proteins were removed by 
using Octadecasilyl-silica columns before 
the assay of IGF-I. The extracted 
serum was assayed for IGF-I concentration 
with the iodine 125 radioimmunoassay 
kit (Instar, Stillwater, Minn) by 
using a polyclonal rabbit antibody. 
Human serum IGF-I was used to generate 
a standard curve. The sensitivity of 
the assay was approximately 20 µg/L. 
The intra- and inter-assay variances 
were 4.5% and 7.2%, respectively. 

SERUM IGFBP3 DETERMINATION. The 
determination of all serum IGFBP3 
levels was also performed in one assay.

Data were compared by using 2-tailed 
t tests for non-paired data. A multivariate 
linear regression analysis was performed 
by using the mean baseline 
serum IGF-I levels and the change in 
its level after treatment as the dependent 
variables versus the mean values 
and changes in the variables RDI, 
SaO2 percent, desaturation index, duration 
of slow-wave sleep and stage II 
sleep, which served as independent 
variables. The null hypothesis was rejected 
at the 5% level. 

RESULTS 

Patients 

Thirteen prepubertal children, 11 
boys and 2 girls, participated in this 
study. The mean age at surgery (T&A) 
was 6.0 ± 2.8 years (range, 1.6 to 10.8 
years). In 10 children, a PSG study 
was performed, whereas in the other 3, 
overnight oximetry was performed. 
The mean time from the pre-T&A sleep 
study to surgery was 3.0 ± 2.6 months 
(range, 0.3 to 10 months), and the 
mean time between the pre-T&A and 
the post-T&A sleep studies was 5.0 ± 

3.0 months (range, 3 to 10 months).

Serum IGFBP3 was measured by 
IRMA kit (Diagnostic Systems Laboratories 
Inc, Webster, Texas). Ten microliters 
of serum was diluted to 0.5 
mL of IGFBP3 sample diluent and 
then added to coated tubes with goat 
anti-IGFBP3 polyclonal immunoglobulin 
immobilized to the inside wall of 
each tube. The samples were assayed 
for IGFBP3 concentration with 125Ilabeled 
goat anti-IGFBP3 polyclonal 
antibody. Human serum IGFBP3 was 

used to generate a standard curve. The 
intra- and inter-assay coefficient variations 
were less than 4% and 2%, respectively. 
There was negligible IGFBP3 antiserum 
cross-reactivity against IGF-I, 
IGF-II, and the other IGFBPs. 

Data Analysis 

Data for control and OSAS groups 
were compiled and tested for normal 
distribution (Kolmagorov-Smirnov 
test) and are presented as mean ± SD. 

SLEEP CHARACTERISTICS (TABLE I). 

The combined stage III and IV, that is, 
SWS accumulative duration increased 
significantly from 29.1% ± 7.2% before 
to 34.6% ± 9.8% after T&A (P < .02). 
There were no significant changes in 
the accumulative duration spent in the 
other sleep stages, sleep latency, or 
sleep efficiency. 

RESPIRATORY CHARACTERISTICS (TABLE 
II). The RDI and paradoxical breathing 
time significantly decreased from 7.8 ± 

9.1 events/h and 37.4% ± 17.8% to 1.0 ± 
2.2 events/h and 18.6% ± 18.8% (P < 
.02), respectively. There were no significant 
changes in the T90, the desaturation 
index, or the mean sleep SaO2. 
GROWTH. The mean weight standard 
deviation score24 increased significantly 
from 0.86 ± 1.02 to 1.24 ± 0.94, 18

months after T&A (P < .01). Postoperative 
changes in the mean height SDS 
did not reach statistical significance, although 
in 7 of the 13 children there 
was an improvement of at least 0.2 
SDS (Table III). All children were still 
in Tanner stage I (prepubertal) at the 
last follow-up. 

SERUM GROWTH FACTORS. The mean 
serum IGF-I level increased by 70%, 
from 146.3 ± 76.0 ng/mL before T&A 
to 210.3 ± 112.0 ng/mL after T&A (P < 
.01), whereas the IGFBP3 did not 
change significantly (Table III). 

The multivariate linear regression 
analysis showed no correlation between 
the baseline IGF-I levels or its 
change after T&A and any other sleep 
study variable and no relationship between 
baseline serum IGF-I levels or 
its change after T&A and weight or 
height and their change over the 
course of the follow-up. 

DISCUSSION 

Improvement in growth after the resolution 
of OSAS in children is accompanied 
by a significant increase in 
serum IGF-I levels. The children’s 
weight increased after surgery, consistent 
with previous studies reporting 
catch-up growth after T&A.4-11 Although 
there was no statistically significant 
increase in the mean height, in 7 
of the 13 children the SDS of height 
increased by at least 0.2. 

The physiologic secretion of GH is 
episodic and closely associated with 
the sleep-wake cycle. The relationship 
between GH secretion and sleep was 
first reported by Quabbe et al.25 Other 
investigators expanded on these findings 
and linked the nocturnal GH secretion 
to the first cycle of SWS.26 It 
has been suggested that GH secretion 
is associated with sleep onset and transition 
from non-rapid eye movement 
sleep to rapid eye movement sleep 
rather than SWS.27,28 Buzi et al29 suggested 
that nocturnal GH secretion in 

prepubertal short children is independent 
of the different sleep stages. 

The only parameter of sleep architecture 
that changed after T&A was the 
SWS accumulative duration, which increased 
by 5.5%. However, we have no 
data to prove that the increase in SWS 
is the direct cause of the increase in 
IGF-I levels. Studies in adult patients 
with OSAS also demonstrated elevated 
GH levels after continuous positive 
airway pressure therapy, accompanied 
by an increase in the total amount of 
SWS.30,31 Although the reduction in 
the amount of SWS may interrupt the 
secretion of GH, the precise linkage 
between GH secretion and SWS is not 
sufficiently clear. GH secretion is not 
directly associated with SWS.27-29 It is 
possible that SWS is an indirect factor 
that amplifies the secretion of GH, 
rather than a direct stimulus. It is also 
possible that both GH secretion and 
SWS are interrupted simultaneously 
and independently by the respiratory 
disturbance, and thus without a direct 
association between them, both increase 
after the resolution of OSAS. 

Serum IGF-I levels reflect daily 
mean GH levels.15,16 Others have 
shown a similar correlation between 
IGFBP3 and mean GH levels.17 An increase 
in serum IGF-I levels points to 
a role for the GH-IGF-I axis in the 
catch-up growth after T&A in children 
with OSAS. Although the serum IGFI 
levels increased significantly after 
surgery, there was no significant 
change in serum IGFBP3 levels. This 
dissociation between IGF-I and 
IGFBP3 levels may express the complexity 
of the IGF-I and the IGF-binding 
protein systems, which are controlled 
by several positive and negative 
feedback pathways, rather than one 
simple pathway. The increase in IGF-I 
levels without a corresponding change 
in IGFBP3 levels may indicate an elevation 
of the free IGF-I levels, because 
IGFBP3 is the major binding protein 
in the circulation. It should be emphasized 
that although there was a significant 
improvement in sleep-disordered 

breathing after treatment, the respiratory 
parameters did not return to normal 
in some of the children. 

Serum IGF-I levels change minimally 
with growth in the prepubertal period.
32 In our study all the children remained 
prepubertal throughout the 
study period. In addition, the duration 
of SWS is not expected to change in 
the course of a few months in this age 
group. Thus in this study group, the 
change in serum IGF-I is probably not 
time- or age-dependent. Each patient 
served as his or her own control, and 
the interval between the 2 PSG studies 
and serum IGF-I measurements was 
relatively short (a few months), so it is 
unlikely that the change in SWS and 
IGF-I is time dependent. 

We assume that the respiratory disturbance 
during sleep in children with 
OSAS is associated with an interruption 
of nocturnal GH secretion, a major factor 
in growth retardation. This hypothesis 
is supported by several studies in 
adults with OSAS, which demonstrated 
an increase in GH levels after treatment 
with CPAP.12,30,31 Cooper et al31 measured 
blood levels of insulin, C-peptide, 
GH, cortisol, and glucagon together 
with the intermediate metabolites of carbohydrate 
in 6 obese nondiabetic adult 
patients with OSAS, with and without 
CPAP. They found a marked reduction 
in GH concentrations in patients with 
OSAS, with a significant increase on the 
CPAP night, indicating that the suppression 
of GH secretion in untreated 
patients with OSAS is rapidly reversed 
by appropriate therapy.31 Previous studies 
suggested that failure to thrive in 
children with OSAS is related to energy 
balance, that there is a reduced energy 
supply stemming from dysphagia and 
lack of appetite,5,11 and that there is increased 
energy consumption because of 
the increased respiratory effort during 
sleep.6,14 

The small number of patients is a relative 
limitation of this study. However, 
the significant increase in serum IGF-I 
levels, which is described for the first 
time in children with OSAS, could 


BAR ET AL 

make an important contribution to the 
understanding of growth retardation in 
these children. The improvement in 
growth after surgical removal of the nasopharyngeal 
airway obstruction is a 
well-known phenomenon, possibly involving 
multiple factors such as increased 
GH secretion, increased caloric 
intake, decreased energy expenditure, 
and an increase in serum IGF-I levels. 

The significant increase in serum IGF-I 
levels and weight in children with OSAS 
after T&A found in this study indicates a 
role for the IGF-I axis in growth retardation 
of children with chronic upper 
airway obstruction caused by hypertrophied 
adenoids and tonsils.
