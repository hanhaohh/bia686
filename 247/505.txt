Summary. Adenotonsillectomy 
(T&A) 
has 
established 
effectiveness 
for 
the 
treatment 
of 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
(OSA). 
However, 
more 
than 
20% 
of 
children 
with 
OSA 
have 
respiratory 
compromise 
requiring 
medical 
intervention 
in 
the 
postoperative 
period. 
The 
reasons 
for 
this 
complication 
are 
not 
well-defined. 
We 
aimed 
to 
compare 
the 
nature 
and 
severity 
of 
sleep-
disordered 
breathing 
in 
children 
with 
mild 
and 
severe 
OSA 
on 
the 
first 
night 
following 
adenotonsillectomy. 
Ten 
children 
were 
classified 
into 
groups 
of 
mild 
and 
severe 
OSA, 
based 
on 
preoperative 
testing. 
On 
the 
first 
night 
after 
T&A, 
they 
underwent 
polysomnography, 
including 
electroencephalograph, 
submental 
electromyography, 
bilateral 
electro-oculograms, 
monitoring 
of 
respiratory 
movements, 
heart 
rate, 
ECG, 
and 
oxygen 
saturation. 
Sleep-disordered 
breathing 
was 
assessed 
by 
the 
apnea-hypopnea 
index, 
the 
SaO2 
nadir, 
and 
the 
desaturation 
index, 
including 
dips 
in 
saturation 
below 
90% 
(DI90). 
Sleep 
quality 
was 
assessed 
by 
sleep 
efficiency, 
time 
spent 
in 
each 
sleep 
state, 
and 
respiratory 
arousal 
index. 
Obstructive 
events 
occurred 
postoperatively 
in 
all 
children, 
but 
were 
more 
frequent 
in 
those 
with 
severe 
OSA 
preoperatively: 
the 
median 
(interquartile 
range) 
mixed/obstructive 
apnea/hypopnea 
indicies 
were 
6.9 
(2.2–9.8) 
events/hr 
and 
21.5 
(15.1– 
112.1) 
events/hr 
for 
the 
mild 
OSA 
group 
and 
the 
severe 
OSA 
group, 
respectively 
(P 
¼ 
0.009). 
Obstructive 
events 
were 
the 
major 
cause 
of 
desaturation 
during 
sleep 
postoperatively. 
Sleep 
quality 
was 
severely 
disrupted 
in 
both 
groups, 
with 
reductions 
in 
both 
slow-wave 
sleep 
and 
rapid 
eye 
movement 
sleep. 
In 
conclusion, 
despite 
removal 
of

upper 
airway 
obstruction 
occurred 
on 
the

postoperative 
night 
in 
children 
with

This 
study 
is 
the 
first 
to

INTRODUCTION 

Upper airway obstruction is an increasingly common 
indication for adenotonsillectomy (T&A) in children.1 
T&A has established effectiveness for the treatment of 
obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).2,3 If adenotonsillar enlargement 
is the predominant factor contributing to OSA in 
children,4 removal of the tonsils and adenoids should lead 
to immediate resolution of airway obstruction during 
sleep. However, several studies found that more than 20% 
of children with OSA have respiratory compromise 
requiring intervention in the postoperative period,5 and 
we reported that 60% of children with severe OSA 
required medical or nursing interventions following 
adenotonsillectomy.6–8 The most common intervention 
in these studies was the administration of supplemental 
oxygen. However, 11% of these children required reintubation 
for obstructive symptoms in the postoperative

period, a finding at variance with the reduction in 
obstructive events on the first postoperative night reported 
by Helfaer et al.9 in 15 children with mild to moderate 
OSA. 

In this study, we aimed to document the mechanism and 
severity of sleep-disordered breathing on the first night 
following adenotonsillectomy, comparing children with 
mild and severe OSA. We hypothesized that obstructive 
apnea would explain postoperative desaturation, and that 
these events would be more frequent in children with 
severe OSA. 

METHODS 

Otherwise healthy children over age 2 years with a 
history of habitual snoring and witnessed apnea during 
sleep were recruited into two groups, based on preoperative 
severity of OSA. Children with medical conditions 
other than OSA, including craniofacial syndromes and 
neuromuscular and cardiac disorders, were excluded. 
Inclusion in the severe OSA group required a history 
suggestive of OSA, adenotonsillar enlargement, and an 
overnight oximetry showing clusters of desaturations with 
multiple dips in SaO2 below 85%.10 Children with 
multiple dips below 90% were shown in our previous 
study to have a median apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) of 

16.4 events/hr.10 Those with mild OSA had a history 
suggestive of OSA, adenotonsillar enlargement, and an 
apnea/hypopnea index of 1–10 events/hr on polysomnography, 
without significant desaturation (SaO2 nadir 
above 85%). The study was approved by the Ethics Committee 
of the Montreal Children’s Hospital, and written 
informed consent was obtained from a parent of each 
subject. 
Adenotonsillectomy was performed under general 
anesthesia with tracheal intubation. All children were 
extubated awake in the operating room prior to transfer to 
the recovery room. Postoperative analgesia was managed 
with morphine until children were able to tolerate enteral 
codeine (1 mg/kg orally) and acetaminophen (10–15 mg/ 
kg, orally or per rectum). 

Polysomnography was performed on the first night after 
surgery, in the usual postoperative unit (surgical ward, 
postanesthetic care unit, or intensive care unit), and was 
attended by one or two of the authors (G.M.N. and 
A.S.K.). Surgery was usually performed in the morning 
(8 of 10 subjects), with a latest surgery time of 2:40 PM. All 
children were awake and drinking in the afternoon before 
polysomnography began. The following signals were 
recorded once the child settled down for the night and until 
spontaneous waking after 6 AM: electroencephalogram 
(C3/A2 and C4/A1), submental electromyogram, right 
and left electro-oculograms, calibrated respiratory inductance 
plethysmography (thorax, abdomen, and sum, Respitrace 
Plus1, Non-Invasive Monitoring Systems, Inc., 

First Night After Adenotonsillectomy for OSA 333 

Miami, FL), electrocardiogram (Respitrace Plus1), SaO2 
(Nellcor N-200 oximeter set to mode 2, 2–3-sec averaging 
time, Nellcor Corp., Hayward, CA), and heart rate 
(Nellcor). All signals were recorded and analyzed using 
a digital polysomnography system (Nicolet, Ultrasom, 
Madison, WI). 

Sleep state was scored according to standard criteria.11 
Sleep quality was assessed using the following measures: 
total sleep time, sleep period time (time available for 
sleep), sleep latency, sleep efficiency (proportion of time 
available for sleep that was spent asleep), time awake after 
sleep onset, respiratory arousals/hour, and percentages of 
each stage of sleep. An arousal was defined according to 
American Sleep Disorders Association (ASDA) criteria.12 
Apneas and hypopneas were identified using the sum 
signal of the calibrated respiratory inductance plethysmography 
(RIP). An American Academy of Sleep Medicine 
Task Force found that this signal provides acceptable 
detection of apneas and hypopneas.13 Other flow monitors 
were not attempted because it was felt that monitors on the 
face would not be tolerated by these preschool children in 
the postoperative period, and the copious nasal secretions 
would render impractical recordings of nasal airflow. 
Apnea was defined as a reduction in RIP sum signal to less 
than 20% of baseline, lasting 3 or more seconds. 
Hypopnea was defined as a reduction in the same signal 
to 20–50% of baseline, also lasting 3 sec or more, and 
associated with a reduction in SaO2 of at least 4%. A 
desaturation event was defined as a reduction in SaO2 of at 
least 4% in response to a respiratory event. The mixed/ 
obstructive apnea/hypopnea index (MOAHI, events/hr of 
sleep) was calculated for each subject. In addition, respiratory 
parameters were calculated for the first and last 
thirds of total sleep time, and for rapid eye movement 
(REM) and non rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. 

Statistical Analysis 

Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS for 
Windows program, version 9.0.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, 
IL). Statistics for nonparametric data were used in all cases 
because of the low numbers in each group. Clinical 
characteristics and all aspects of polysomnography results 
were compared between the two groups using the Mann-
Whitney U-test for nonparametric data. Comparisons of 
respiratory parameters between REM and non-REM 
sleep, and between the first and the last third of the night, 
were compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. 

RESULTS 

Five subjects were recruited in each group, matched for 
gender and age. The clinical characteristics of the two 
groups are shown in Table 1. The median (interquartile 
range) oxygen saturation nadir on preoperative testing 
was 76% (54–79%) in the severe OSA group, and 87%

(86–91%) in the mild OSA group. The median (interquartile 
range) number of desaturations below 90% per 
hour of recording time14 was 30/hr (11.0–108.5) in the 
severe OSA group, and 2/hr (1.5–3.5) in the mild OSA 
group. The mild OSA group had a median (interquartile 
range) AHI preoperatively of 4.4 (2.2–7.1) events/hr. 

One boy in the severe OSA group had tonsillectomy 
only (having previously had adenoidectomy); all other 
subjects had adenotonsillectomy. Surgical technique was 
the same in all cases: hot electrocautery dissection tonsillectomy 
and electrocautery ablative adenoidectomy.15,16 
All children received an inhalational induction (halothane, 
n ¼ 
1; sevoflurane, n ¼ 
9). Seven children received propofol 
(mild OSA group, 4). Maintenance anesthesia was 
with isoflurane. Intraoperative opioids were used in all 
children. At the discretion of the anesthesiologist and 
surgeon, dexamethasone was given intraoperatively to 
7 children (severe OSA group, n ¼ 
3; mild OSA group, 
n ¼ 
4; P 
¼ 
NS). Postoperative analgesia was achieved 
with morphine, at a mean (SD) dose of 0.08 (0.02) mg/kg. 
There was no difference in morphine dose between the 
mild and severe OSA groups (P 
¼ 
0.95). Postoperatively, 
codeine and acetominophen were used in 2 and 4 patients 
in each group, respectively. 

At least 5 hr (median, 9.3 hr) elapsed between time of 
surgery and the start of polysomnography recording. The 
total recording time exceeded 448 min (minimum 7.5 hr; 
median 10.2 hr) in all cases. Obstructive events were seen 

in all patients on the first postoperative night. Obstructive 
apneas and hypopneas were about 4 times as frequent and 
were associated with greater desaturation in the severe 
OSA group than in the mild OSA group (Table 2, Fig. 1). 
Desaturation events were mainly due to obstructive apneas 
and hypopneas, particularly in the severe OSA group. 
Central apneas caused the other events (Table 2). Hypoxia 
due to other causes (e.g., hypoventilation, pneumonia, or 
acute respiratory distress syndrome) did not occur in either 
group. 

There was a trend toward more apnea and desaturation 
in REM sleep than during quiet sleep. The postoperative 
mixed/obstructive apnea-hypopnea index was higher during 
REM sleep than during NREM sleep in 9 of 10 patients 
(median of 49 and 6 events/hr, respectively, P 
¼ 
0.07). The 
SaO2 nadir was similar in non-REM sleep and REM sleep 
(median, 85.5 vs 87.0%; P 
¼ 
0.07). 

The SaO2 nadir was lower in the last third of the night 
(P 
¼ 
0.04), but obstructive apneas were not significantly 
longer in the last third (P 
¼ 
0.58). The mean SaO2, the 
mixed/obstructive apnea-hypopnea index, mean apnea 
duration, time spent with SaO2 below 90%, and the respiratory 
arousal index were not different between the first 
and last thirds of the night (Table 3). This was despite 
increased REM sleep in the last third compared to the first 
third of the night in all children (P 
¼ 
0.005). 

One patient (male, age 2.8 years, severe OSA group) 
required intervention for respiratory compromise. Mask

First Night After Adenotonsillectomy for OSA 335 

DISCUSSION 

Adenotonsillectomy is well-established as an effective 
therapy for the majority of otherwise healthy children with 
OSA and adenotonsillar enlargement.2,3,18 This effectiveness 
was determined by resolution of signs and symptoms, 
improved growth, and repeat polysomnography several 
weeks after T&A. However, adenotonsillectomy for OSA 
in children may be complicated by postoperative respiratory 
compromise.5 This study is the first to demonstrate 
that sleep-related airway obstruction is the mechanism of 
the common postoperative complication of significant 
desaturation after adenotonsillectomy in children with 
severe OSA. Episodes of desaturation occurred during the 
first postoperative night in all 10 children studied, and 
these desaturation episodes were predominantly caused 
by upper airway obstruction. Obstructive apneas and 
hypopneas were more frequent and were associated with 
greater desaturation in those with more severe OSA 
preoperatively. The onset of respiratory compromise in 
these children was delayed at least 5 hr from surgery and 
the desaturation occurred during sleep, confirming the 
report of Koomson et al.19 The delayed onset of 
respiratory compromise and the occurrence of desaturation 
during sleep have implications for postoperative care. 

Several mechanisms may explain ongoing upper airway 
obstruction after T&A, and the observation that this is 
more marked in the severe OSA group. All children had 
copious nasal secretions following surgery (personal 
observation), and reactive, postsurgical edema in the 
adenoid and tonsillar beds would be expected. In obstructive 
sleep apnea in children, upper airway obstruction 
was shown to worsen through the night due to the 
increased proportion of REM sleep in the latter part of the 
night.20 Surprisingly, we did not find this pattern, raising 
the possibility that surgical factors exacerbated upper 
airway obstruction, particularly in the first part of the 
night. However, the difference between the mild and 
severe OSA groups makes this explanation less likely: the 
anesthesia given was similar for all children, and the 
surgical operation removes virtually all adenoid and

differences in airway structure between the mild and

OSA require more surgical dissection and therefore might 
have more reactive edema and secretions postoperatively. 
More likely, the severity of OSA that is present pre-
operatively may be an indicator of the presence of a 
primary or acquired abnormality that predisposes the child 
to severe OSA and continues to be present postoperatively, 
possibly compounded by postoperative edema and secretions. 
Children with more severe OSA have increased 
upper airway collapsibility,21,22 and are more susceptible 
to the respiratory-depressant effects of anesthesia and 
opiate drugs.23,24 Longer apneas in the severe group raise 
the possibility of an abnormality in arousal response.25–27 
While we did not perform repeat polysomnography in all 
children in this study, the subject with the most severe 
obstructive events on the first postoperative night did have 
a normal nocturnal oximetry several weeks after surgery 
(Fig. 2). 

We demonstrated that the first night after adenotonsillectomy 
is marked by sleep disturbance, airway obstruction, 
and desaturation. By excluding children at high risk 
for postoperative respiratory complications (age under 
2 years, preterm birth, and comorbidity), we attempted to 
isolate the effect of preoperative severity of OSA on 
breathing postoperatively. Our comparison of severity of 
postoperative upper airway obstruction in the two groups 
was limited by the fact that the subjects with severe OSA 
preoperatively did not undergo preoperative polysomnography. 
However, these children had an average of 30 dips 
in SaO2 per hour and a median SaO2 nadir of 76%, 
measures that in our previous work closely correlated with 
high apnea/hypopnea and respiratory arousal indices.28 

The abnormalities in sleep quality demonstrated in this 
study were striking. The literature would suggest that 
sleep architecture, particularly the quantity of REM sleep, 
is usually preserved in children with OSA before treat


20,29

ment.We demonstrated severe sleep disruption in all 
subjects, including reduced REM sleep, unrelated to the 
preoperative severity of OSA. This finding is consistent 
with sleep patterns previously described in adults after 

30,31

surgery.In adults, anesthesia leads to a reduction in 
slow-wave sleep in the first postanesthetic night,31 and 
sleep after surgery is characteristically low in REM and 
slow-wave sleep.30 In addition to possible effects of 
anesthetic and analgesic drugs, pain, environmental noise, 
disturbance by nursing interventions, anxiety, and the 
unfamiliar environment all contribute to poor-quality 
sleep in the immediate postoperative period. 

The literature does not answer the question of which 
children should remain in hospital overnight after adenotonsillectomy. 
Small, intensively monitored, prospective 
studies such as our own speak to the mechanism of postoperative 
respiratory compromise.9 Moderate-sized retrospective 
studies established demographic and medical 
factors that predispose children to postoperative respiratory 
complications.32 They also stated that severe OSA is a 


risk factor, a condition that requires preoperative diagnostic 
testing, as it is not identifiable by history or clinical 
examination.33,34 Given the limitations of retrospective 
study design, the literature is likely to underestimate the 
actual amount of postoperative desaturation. All children 
in our small prospective study demonstrated desaturation 
on the first postoperative night. In agreement with Helfaer 
et al.,9 the only other study using polysomnography to 
document sleep and breathing in the first night after 
adenotonsillectomy, we report an improvement in SaO2 
nadir postoperatively in most cases (Fig. 1). However, our 
study demonstrates desaturation to dangerous levels in the 
severe OSA group. Helfaer et al.9 suggested that children 
aged over 3 years with mild OSA (<15 events/hr) could be 
discharged on the day of surgery. By defining mild OSA as 
an AHI of up to 15/hr, and by including children with 
significant preoperative desaturation (6 of 15 subjects had 
a preoperative SaO2 nadir of <80%), that study may have 
underestimated the importance of OSA severity, particularly 
preoperative saturation nadir, as a predictor of 
significant airway obstruction in the postoperative period. 
We submit that the severity of OSA as assessed by the 
saturation nadir is an important predictor of postoperative 
desaturation (Fig. 3). Large prospective studies are needed 
to determine the discharge policy in children, given the 
rare but tragic incidence of respiratory arrest following 
adenotonsillectomy in the child with OSA.6,8,28 

In our study, continuous pulse oximetry monitoring in 
the postoperative period detected a high incidence of 
desaturation. Standard apnea monitoring is not sufficient 
for postoperative monitoring, as it is unable to detect 
obstructive apnea and hypopnea, and bradycardia is 

35,36

uncommon.Our local practice is therefore to use 
continuous pulse oximetry for postoperative monitoring 
after T&A for children with OSA. Given the frequency 
and severity of hypoxemia, airway obstruction, and 
respiratory compromise demonstrated in this study and 
others, we recommend overnight nursing observation plus 
continuous pulse oximetry for children with severe OSA 
for at least 1 night postoperatively in an appropriate unit 
skilled in pediatric airway management.
