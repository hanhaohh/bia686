ABSTRACT 

Objective: To identify the clinical factor(s) that 
identify obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) 
in children. 

Methods: A prospective study of children referred 
to the sleep clinic of the paediatric department 
was conducted in a public non-teaching regional 
hospital in Hong Kong.A standard questionnaire was 
administered and overnight sleep polysomnography 
was performed in a consecutive series of patients. 
Logistic regression analysis was performed to 
obtain significant risk factors for prediction of 
OSAS in this series of patients. 

Results: Sixty-two children were enrolled into the 
study and 22 were diagnosed to have OSAS. Logistic 
regression analysis showed that, among all the 
answers, ‘snoring every night’ is the single most 
significant risk factor (p<0.0001) to predict OSAS. 
‘Snoring every night’ has a sensitivity of 91% and 
specificity of 75% for OSAS patients. It also has a 
positive predictive value of 67% and negative 
predictive value of 94%. 

Conclusion: Snoring every night is an important 
risk factor in identifying OSAS in children. Priority 
for an overnight sleep polysomnogram should 
be given to those with this symptom.

INTRODUCTION 

Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) in 
children was estimated to affect 1-4% of children(1,2). 
The underlying pathogenesis involves an interaction 
of anatomical factors (e.g. adenotonsillar hypertrophy, 
subtle retrognathia, craniofacial malformation) and 
dynamic factors such as muscle tone of the pharyngeal 
airway(3). Snoring is the cardinal symptom. Other typical 
clinical features include difficulty in breathing during 
sleep, observed apnoea, restlessness, enuresis, 

and daytime symptoms like sleepiness, hyperactivity, 
behavioural and learning problems. However, previous 
studies showed that clinical risk factors are not well-
related to OSAS(4-6). Among the snoring children, only 
about 10 to 30% of them(1,7-10) were actually found to 
have OSAS as diagnosed by the sleep polysomnograph 
(PSG). Given the potentially serious sequel of untreated 
OSAS, e.g. cor pulmonale, respiratory failure and 
intellectual impairment(11), and the expenses of performing 
PSG, identification of significant clinical risk factors 
in different population remains an important task. 
This study aims at identification of clinical risk factors 
for OSAS in Chinese children in Hong Kong. 

METHODS 

Sixty-two children were referred to our sleep clinic 
for suspected OSAS by paediatricians or general 
practitioners from January 1998 to December 1999. 
All of them presented with snoring with or without 
other symptoms of OSAS. A questionnaire modified 
from a validated questionnaire by Brouillette et al(12) was 
filled in by one of the three authors. If the informants, 
usually the parents, were not sure about some of the 
answers, they would undertake an observation period 
of a few weeks. The clinician would also perform a 
standard clinical assessment for them. Those children 
who had neurological abnormalities or craniofacial 
syndromes were excluded from the study. 

All of them underwent an overnight polysomnogragh 
(PSG) in our sleep laboratory. Alice 3 (Respironics, 
Pittsburgh, USA) computerised sleep monitoring 
system was used. Sleep stages were scored according 
to the Rechtschaffen & Kales criteria by one of the 
following authors (DN,KC,KK)(13). The scorers 
were not blinded. The following 15 channels were 
monitored: 4 electroencephalogram (EEG) channels, 
2 electrooculogram (EOG) channels, chin and leg 
electromyogram (EMG) channels, oro-nasal airflow 
thermistor, chest and abdominal respiratory impedance 
plethysmography, electrocardiogram, oxygen saturation, 
snoring and body positioning sensor. An obstructive 
apnoeic episode was defined by the decrease of airflow 
by more than 80% for more than two respiratory cycles

Data were analysed by the Statistical Programs for 
Social Science (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Mean 
and standard deviations (S.D) were used to describe 
continuous variables. Logistic regression analysis of 
the risk factors for OSAS (i.e. AHI >1) were performed. 
A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. 

RESULTS 

Sixty-two children were recruited consecutively from 
the sleep clinic. The mean age was 6.79 years +/- 3.6 years 
(range: 2-13 years). Male to female ratio was 36 to 26 

(1.38 : 1). Twenty-two of them (12 boys and 10 girls) 
were diagnosed to have OSAS. AHI ranged from 
1.62 to 72.4, mean AHI 8.62 +/- 8.12. There was no 
statistically significant difference in gender and age 
distribution between the OSAS and the non-OSAS 
group (Table I). The common symptoms of the two 
groups were listed in Table II. Logistic regression 
analysis for various factors that contribute to OSAS 
was performed. Snoring every night turned out to be 
the only significant risk factors although observed 
apnea was found to approach significance with a 
p value of 0.055. (Table III) All other factors were not 
statistically significant. Regular snoring every night 
was found to be the most significant risk factor of OSAS. 
The odds ratio was 10.67 (95% C.I. 2.72-41.8). For the 
current studied population of children suspected to 
in the presence of respiratory effort. Obstructive 
hypopnoea was defined as a decrease in airflow by 50 to 
80% in the presence of respiratory effort, together with 
the presence of desaturation of more than 4% or EEG 
arousal. Each PSG was scored by one of the authors 
blindly in the absence of any clinical data. For the current 
study, the diagnostic criteria of OSAS is an obstructive 
apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) of more than one(14). 

have OSAS, the positive predictive value of nightly 
snoring was of 67% and absence of nightly snoring 
had a negative predictive value of 94%. Its sensitivity 
was 91% and the specificity was 75%. 

DISCUSSION 

There are several important observations in the current 
prospective study. Firstly, the overall prevalence of 
OSAS in our patients is 36%. This is much higher than 
the reported OSAS prevalence of 0.7 to 10.3% in the 
literature. The reasons are several-fold. Our patients 
were of higher risk groups as all were referrals from 
the inpatient service, the outpatient clinics and 
community-based doctors because of sleep disordered 
breathing symptoms. Moreover, the heterogeneity 
of diagnostic criteria of OSAS in children in the 
worldwide literature also contributes to a wide difference 
in the prevalence of this disease. Some studies did

not use PSG for the diagnosis. For example, Ali et al(1) 
reported an estimated prevalence of sleep-disordered 
breathing of 0.7% in a group of children without PSG. 
For studies that employed PSG as diagnostic criteria, 
Gislason et al(8) reported a prevalence of 2.9% among 
a group of habitual snorers and their diagnostic criteria 
was an apnoea-hypopnoea index of greater than 3. Redline 
et al(15) reported the prevalence in a general population 
of children to be 1.6% and 10.3% by using a diagnostic 
criteria of AHI more than 10 and 5 respectively. Hence, 
our high prevalence results from both our lower 
threshold of diagnosing OSAS, i.e. AHI >1 and our 
patients came from a selected high-risk group of 
children. The sex ratio showed no statistically significant 
difference between the OSAS and non-OSAS groups 
and this is in line with the worldwide literature about 
the equal sex ratio of OSAS in children(15,16). The mean 
age of our OSAS patients was 6.24 years and 14 out of 
22 of them (63.6%) were within three to six years old, 
the reported peak age group of OSAS(2). 

Mallory et al(17) studied 41 obese children with the 
mean age of 10.3 years and 24% of these children had 
AHI more than five. Marcus et al(18) studied 22 obese 
children with the mean age of 10-year and 27% of these 
children were found to have OSAS. Redline et al(15) 
reported that obesity increased the risk for OSAS by 
four to five folds in 364 children with the mean age of 
11 years. In contrast to these previous studies, the current 
series showed no difference in prevalence of obesity in 
the OSAS and non-OSAS group. These could be 
explained by the following factors: the relatively small 
sample size in the current series; the younger age of 
children in the current series (mean age of 6.2-year 
vs. 10-year in the previous series); the high risk OSAS 
status of the children in the current series may obscure 
the effect of obesity on OSAS. 

In children, normal value of obstructive apnoea of 
any duration was found to be 0.1 +/- 0.5 per hour(14). 
However, OSAS is best quantified by the combined 
apnoea and hyponoea episodes per hour, apnoea

hyponoea index (AHI). Unfortunately, normal values 
of AHI are not available for children. AHI values of 
5,10,15, 20 or 30 were used as indicative of OSAS 
in different studies(19). AHI more than one was 
regarded as OSAS in the authors’ department because 
all the cases were referred for suspected OSAS and 
represented a high risk group and a high sensitivity 
was desirable. 

Considering the individual risk factors, snoring 
every night is the most powerful predictor for OSAS 
and the presence of it signified a significantly increased 
risk of OSAS. It also gives a very good sensitivity (91%) 
and a reasonable specificity (75%) when used as a 
screening question for suspected OSAS. Enlarged tonsils 
are a common finding in children and no difference was 
found in the current study regarding size of tonsils 
as judged by clinical assessment and OSAS status. 
However, a recent study of volume measurement of 
tonsils by magnetic resonance imaging study showed 
that the volume of tonsils were indeed larger in children 
with OSAS compared with control, 9.1 ml vs. 5.8 ml 
(p<0.0005)(20). It reflects clearly that clinical estimation 
of tonsil volume is far too inaccurate to be useful as a 
risk estimate. We did also evaluate the relative risks 
of some other well-known features in OSAS like 
restlessness, daytime sleepiness, enuresis (see 
questionnaire) but none of them were significantly 
related to OSAS. 

Previous studies showed that symptoms and 
signs were not reliable in the diagnosis of OSAS(4,21). 
The inaccuracy was attributed to the fact that 
questionnaire depends highly on the accuracy of 
reporting by the caretakers who could be quite 
ignorant about the sleep symptoms. For example, it 
is well known that the apnoeic episodes occur more 
during the latter half of the night when children are 
in rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep. Their parents 
who would be asleep would not note such symptoms. 
However, it is evident from our present study that a 
carefully administered standardised questionnaire 
by trained clinicians together with an observation 
period in cases of doubt would help select out the 
high risk cases of OSAS in children. 

There are some limitations in our study. We had 
not measured the intrascorer and interscorer 
variability although all the scorers had received a 
standard training programme and followed a standard 
scoring protocol under close supervision of the 
consultant, DKN. The second limitation was the 
selection bias that was introduced when parents who 
could not give answers to the questions at the first 
contact were allowed to take a further observation 

again. The third limitation is the small number of 
patients studied. 

In conclusion, our study showed that nightly 
snoring is an important risk factor of OSAS. PSG 
should be arranged to those children who have 
this symptom.
