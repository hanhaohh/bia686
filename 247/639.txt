by Tonsillectomy and/or Adenoidectomy 
on Obesity in Children

Background: Obstructive sleep apnea is common in 
obese children who have enlarged tonsils and adenoids. 

Objective: To determine if treatment of obstructive sleep 
apnea by tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy will result 
in normalization of an obese child’s weight, as it does 
in underweight children, and as it does with other signs 
and symptoms. 

Design: Retrospective cohort study. We recorded weight 
and height changes after tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy 
and compared changes of the obese and morbidly 
obese patients with those of the other patients. 

Setting: A tertiary care inner-city hospital. 

Participants: Children (n = 45) who underwent tonsillectomy 
and/or adenoidectomy for obstructive sleep apnea 
in 1994-1995; their mean (±SD) age was 4.9 ± 2.4 
years at operation. 

Results: At the time of surgery, 25 children were of 
normal weight; 3, underweight; 7, obese; and 10, morbidly 
obese. Postoperatively, 31 children (69%), including 
10 of the 17 who were obese or morbidly obese, 
had substantial weight gain: the z score ± SD for weight 
of the entire group increased from 1.37 ± 2.49 to 2 ± 

2.27 (P,.001). The mean z score ± SD for height 
increased from 0.03 ± 1.08 to 0.58 ± 0.94 (P,.001). 
The body mass index (BMI or Quetelet index): calculated 
as weight in kilograms divided by the square of 
the height in meters increased in 28 patients (62%) 
(P = .004). 
Conclusion: Treating obstructive sleep apnea by tonsillectomy 
and/or adenoidectomy is associated with 
increased gain in height, weight, and body mass index 
in most children, including the obese and morbidly 
obese.

Editor’s Note: Now here’s one to think about. Is it better to have 
obstructive sleep apnea or morbid obesity? Might initial treatment 
of the morbid obesity solve both problems? Would that it was 
this easy.

T HAS been shown that obstructive 
sleep apnea (OSA) may cause 
poor growth in children, which 
can be severe enough to present 
as failure to thrive. Growth may 
improve and failure to thrive may resolve 
following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy.

Disturbed sleep and sleep deprivation 
with subsequent daytime hypersomnolence 
and decreased activities are also 
known effects of OSA in children.11 We 
thought that this decreased energy expenditure 
might cause obesity, and therefore 
we hypothesized that treatment of OSA by 
surgery might improve sleep quality, decrease 
hypersomnolence, increase activity, 
and lead to weight loss. 

RESULTS 
Of the 45 patients, 13 (29%) were girls and 
32 (71%) were boys. Most of the children 
were African American or of Caribbean descent. 
Their mean (±SD) age at the time 
of surgery was 4.9 ± 2.4 years (age range, 
1.4-10.25 years). The mean (±SD) follow-
up period after surgery was 15 ± 8.5 
months (range, 6-36 months). All of the 
patients were evaluated at the pediatric 
sleep apnea clinic and had a preoperative 
clinical diagnosis of OSA, with enlarged

Nap PSG, which was performed on 20 of 45 children, 
was diagnostic of OSA; the median (±SD) sleep time 
was 49 ± 19 minutes (range, 40-104 minutes), the median 
respiratory disturbance index (±SD) was 13.8 ± 21.4 
episodes per hour (range, 5-69.5 episodes per hour). Oxygen 
desaturation was found in 9 patients; the lowest de-
saturation ranged between 59% and 86%. Echocardiograms 
revealed signs of pulmonary hypertension in 12 
of the 23 patients. 

All children underwent tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy 
except for 2 who only had an adenoidectomy and 
1 who only had a tonsillectomy, based on assessment of 
airway compromise by the ears, nose, and throat surgeon. 

The children’s weights at the time of the surgery were 
distributed into 4 categories (Table1); 17 (38%) were categorized 
as obese or morbidly obese. Postoperatively, there 
was an increase in weight percentiles in 31 patients (69%) 
(Figure 1and Figure 2). The mean (±SD) z score for 
weight of the whole group increased from 1.37 ± 2.49 to 

2 ± 2.27 (P = .001). No change in the z score for weight was 
noted in 5 patients (11%), and the z score for weight of 9 
patients (20%) decreased. A change in z score does not always 
indicate a change in category; a child’s z score could 
increase or decrease but remain in the same category. All 
3 underweight patients gained enough weight to attain normal 
percentiles. Of the 25 patients of normal weight, 7 became 
obese and the rest remained normal. Of the 7 obese 
patients, 3 became morbidly obese and the others remained 
obese. Of the 10 morbidly obese, 6 actually increased 
their z scores and became even more obese, 1 remained 
the same, and 3 decreased their z scores but 
remained morbidly obese (Table 1). A total of 24 (53%) of 
the children were obese or morbidly obese on follow-up 
(vs 38% preoperatively). 

There was no significant difference in preoperative to 
postoperative z score changes in weight between the obese 
or morbidly obese patients and the other patients (P = .17). 

The mean (±SD) z score for height of these patients 
increased from 0.03 ± 1.08 to 0.58 ± 0.94 (P,.001). The 
percentile changes can be seen in Figure 3 and

ing in 65% of the obese and morbidly obese children. Studies 
in obese adults with OSA who were treated with 
chronic nasal continuous airway pressure found that they 
maintained their weight during treatment.21 

To determine whether the length of time before follow-
up would have an effect on our results, a separate 
analysis of the children was done that compared those 
seen 6 to 12 months after surgery with those seen after 2 
to 3 years, which still revealed a significant increase in z 
scores for heights and weights in both groups. 

Several mechanisms have been found to cause 
poor growth in children with OSA: (1) increased energy 
expenditure from the increased work of breathing during 
sleep,1 (2) poor appetite and difficulty swallowing,4 

(3) stress and catabolism,3 and (4) decreased or abnormal 
growth hormone secretion secondary to disturbed 
sleep architecture.2,22 Perhaps these or other factors 
counterbalance the effects of the presumed sedentary 
lifestyle in obese children with OSA and make them less 
obese and shorter than they would have been without 
OSA. As a result, the treatment of OSA allows them to 
reach their biologically “predestined” height and 
weight. 
We reviewed the history of the obese patients to determine 
if they did not lose weight because they did not 
respond to surgical therapy and if they continued to have 
apnea due to the obesity alone and found that this was 
not the case. Of the 9 morbidly obese patients on whom

follow-up information could be obtained, 8 reported improvement 
in the symptoms of OSA. However, it is possible 
that we might have missed a few patients who still 
had OSA postoperatively. Suen et al23 found that 1 of 6 
children whose mothers reported postoperative cure of 
their children’s symptoms still had apnea when PSG was 
repeated. 

We found that 17 (38%) of the children in the group 
with OSA were obese or morbidly obese prior to therapy, 
which increased to 24 (53%) postoperatively, higher than 
the 2 of 22 and 5 of 50 reported previously by Brouillette 
et al10 and Guilleminault et al.11 This is a remarkable 
finding for a disease known to cause failure to thrive. 
A high incidence (37%-66%) of OSA in obese children 
has been reported,13-15 which suggests that OSA may also 
be an effect of obesity rather than a cause. 

Obesity can cause OSA by narrowing the upper airway, 
as a result of fat deposition in the pharyngeal wall24-25 
and external compression from superficially located fat 
in the subcutaneous area in the neck.26 Additionally, obesity 
reduces the size of the upper airway indirectly through 
a reflex mechanism secondary to a decrease in lung volume 
in obese patients.27 Enlarged tonsils and adenoids 
further compromise the airway.

Various treatments of OSA in obese children have 
been described. In a group of morbidly obese children 
with OSA, Kudoh and Sanai16 found that tonsillectomy 
and/or adenoidectomy and partial weight reduction 
resolved the OSA even if the patients remained morbidly 
obese. Willi et al28 found sleep apnea in 5 of 6 
morbidly obese children, and weight loss led to resolution 
of the apnea. Harris and Allen29 found that children 
with Prader-Willi syndrome had OSA. The severity 
of OSA was related to their weight, and the OSA 
diminished following weight reduction. In adults, the 
severity of OSA was also found to be proportionate to 
a patient’s weight, and weight reduction resolved the 
OSA.30-32 Treatment with nasal continuous positive airway 
pressure is another effective method for treating 
OSA in children.33 

Nap PSG, which was used to diagnose OSA in 20 
children, might underestimate the severity of OSA in these 
children. Marcus et al34 found that nap PSG underestimates 
the severity of OSA in children as compared with 
overnight PSG. However, OSA detected by nap PSG was 
always confirmed by overnight PSG, so that this factor 
does not affect our study. 

Whether the increase in obesity we observed following 
treatment by tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy 
constitutes a substantial health risk in some cases 
awaits longer-term follow-up of such patients. Some health 
risks, such as the development of diabetes, coronary artery 
disease, and hypertension, are increased because of 
obesity itself; others, such as hypoventilation, cor pulmonale, 
heart failure, and death, could develop as a consequence 
of the recurrence of sleep apnea as a further consequence 
of the increasing obesity even in the absence 
of obstructing tonsils and adenoids.35,36 It is important 
to pursue ways to effectively treat obesity in children and 
its resultant OSA and thus eliminate this problem. 

In summary, treatment of OSA by tonsillectomy 
and/or adenoidectomy in obese and morbidly obese children 
leads to clinical improvement of the OSA, but will 
not help with weight reduction and might even exacerbate 
the obesity. When obesity complicates OSA, we think 
that attention should be paid to reducing weight by such 
measures as exercise, diet, and behavioral therapy, in addition 
to treatment of the OSA.
