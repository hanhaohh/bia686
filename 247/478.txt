Abstract 
Background: Researchers and clinicians are seeking to develop efficacious behavioral 
interventions to treat overweight children; however, few studies have documented the behavioral 
correlates of overweight children in community samples. The goal of this study was to determine 
the nature and prevalence of behavior problems for overweight school-aged children versus 
normal weight peers before and after controlling for the effect of sleep disordered breathing. 

Methods: Hispanic and Caucasian children were invited to participate in a study of sleep through 
public elementary school classrooms. Anthropometric evaluation and behavioral ratings were 
collected for 402 children aged 6–11 years. Overweight was calculated using the Centers for 
Disease Control age- and gender-specific guidelines. Children were classified as overweight if they 
were at or above the 95th percentile for their age and gender group. Behavior problems were 
measured using the Conners' Parent Rating Scales-Revised and the Child Behavior Checklist. Sleep 
disordered breathing was assessed using in-home overnight polysomnography. 

Results: Approximately 15% (59/402) of the sample was classified as overweight. Simple odds 
ratios indicated that overweight children were more likely to have clinically relevant levels of 
internalizing symptoms (OR 2.23, CI 1.05–4.72), psychosomatic complaints (OR 2.15, CI 1.02– 
4.54), withdrawal (OR 4.69, CI 2.05–10.73), and social problems (3.18, 1.53–6.60). When odds 
ratios were adjusted for level of sleep disordered breathing, withdrawal (OR 3.83 CI 1.59–9.22) 
and social problems (OR 2.49 CI 1.14–5.44) remained significantly higher for overweight subjects. 

Conclusion: After controlling for the effect of sleep disordered breathing, behaviors such as 
withdrawal and social problems, are common in overweight children and need to be taken into 
account in the design of interventions and services as they may act to moderate the efficacy of 
behavioral treatments. 

Background reported frequently in the research literature and popular

atric overweight has increased dramatically in the last generation, 
that as of 2000 approximately 15% of children 
aged 6–11 are overweight [1], and that 25–31% of children 
and adolescents in the U.S. are overweight or at risk 
of being overweight [2-5]. The health consequences 
related to childhood overweight include insulin resistance, 
type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease later 
in life [6,7]. 

Psychological or behavioral problems in childhood have 
been examined as both causes and effects of overweight. 
That is, overweight has been hypothesized as a possible 
result of psychological symptoms and psychological 
symptoms have been hypothesized to be a result of overweight 
[8-11]. Further evidence for the relationship 
between overweight and behavioral problems is provided 
by treatment studies that have shown decreased levels of 
psychological and behavioral problems in children subsequent 
to treatment for overweight [12-14]. 

Clinical, referred, or screened samples have found relationships 
between overweight and depression [15,16], 
social problems, withdrawal [15], and both internalizing 
and externalizing behaviors [16]. One longitudinal study 
found relationships between chronic overweight and 
oppositional defiant disorder for boys and girls and with 
depression for boys [10]. Alternatively, an epidemiological 
study of adolescents and young adults found a relationship 
between body mass index (BMI) and depression 
only in girls [16]. Mixed samples have found lowered 
social and physical perceived self-competence and wellbeing 
compared to normal weighted peers [17]. Community-
based studies have found depression [18] and overweight 
related in girls and non-specific patterns of 
behavior problems associated with overweight [8]. In 
overweight children and adolescents, quality of life measures 
indicate a lower overall quality of life as well as lower 
self-esteem and physical functioning [19,20]. 

Sleep disordered breathing and obesity are comorbid in 
adults [21]. There is some support for this relationship in 
children. Children diagnosed with sleep disordered 
breathing (SDB) may have a greater probability of comorbid 
overweight [22] and children who are overweight 
have been found to have a greater probability of SDB [23]. 
However, in previously published analyses, the TuCASA 
study (from which the current analyses are derived), have 
not confirmed this relationship [24]. 

There are several limitations to the studies currently available 
linking overweight to behavior in children. Studies 
using non-referred samples have been screened for specific 
psychological disorders [10], are conducted within 
other cultures [17], or have used overweight categorizations 
that are not age- and gender-specific [15,16]. While 

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2431/6/34 

behavioral problems have been linked to SDB, such as 
cognitive problems, hyperactivity, and externalizing 
behaviors [25-27] and behavior problems have been 
linked to overweight (as described above), ideally weight 
and SDB should be considered simultaneously in estimating 
their relationships with behavior. 

Identification of behaviors uniquely related to obesity 
could inform development of behavioral interventions 
and services for children. Clinicians working in this area 
could benefit from understanding the independent contribution 
of overweight on behavioral problems both in 
the presence and absence of SDB. Thus, the goal of the 
current research was to provide a description of the nature 
and prevalence rate of behavior problems, in a general 
population cohort, for overweight and normal weight 
school children after controlling for the presence of sleep 
disordered breathing. We hypothesized that externalizing 
behaviors would be less related to overweight after taking 
into account levels of SDB. 

Methods 

Participants 

Subjects in the current analyses were enrolled in a study of 
sleep in children, the Tucson Children's Assessment of 
Sleep Apnea [24,27,28]. This study recruited 6 through 11 
year old Hispanic and Caucasian children to undergo 
home polysomnography, a sleep questionnaire, and neurocognitive 
testing. A detailed description of recruitment 
procedures has been previously published [24,27,28]. 
Briefly, recruitment was accomplished by soliciting the 
cooperation of 19 selected elementary schools in the Tucson 
Unified School District (TUSD). A short sleep-habits 
screening questionnaire was sent home with all children 
in a "notes home" folder. Parents were asked to complete 
the questionnaire and to provide contact information if 
they agreed to allow study personnel to call and schedule 
a polysomnogram and neurocognitive testing for their 
child. Sleep and demographic questionnaire data, child 
weight and height measures were acquired in the family 
home at the time of the polysomnogram. Behavioral 
questionnaire data were collected from parents when the 
child subsequently underwent neurocognitive testing 
within the Department of Pediatrics. The TUSD Research 
Committee and the University of Arizona Institutional 
Review Board approved the study protocol. Parents or 
guardians completed approved consent forms and children 
completed assent forms before participating in the 
study. 

Children were excluded from the study if there was a history 
of head injury, tonsillectomy, mental retardation, or 
asthma. Families were paid $25 for completing the sleep 
study and $25 for completing the behavioral evaluation.

Measurement 

Weight 

Children were classified as overweight if their BMI was at 
or over the 95th percentile for age- and gender-specific 
normative values [29]. Children below the 95th percentile 
were classified as "normal weight". The group referred to 
as "normal weight" included those children at risk for 
overweight (between the 85th and 94th percentiles for 
their sex and age). 

Behavior 

The Conners' Parent Rating Scale – Revised (CPRS-R) is a 
well validated 80-item behavior rating scale that measures 
symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 
(ADHD; hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention) as 
well as comorbid behaviors such as oppositional behavior, 
anxiety, and somatic complaints [30]. All 12 CPRS-R 
scales focus on behaviors central to a diagnosis of ADHD 
such as Cognitive Problems and Hyperactivity or measure 
behaviors that are commonly comorbid with inattention 
and hyperactivity, such as social problems. Three scales on 
the CPRS-R are considered internalizing correlates of 
ADHD (Anxious-Shy, Perfectionism, and Psychosomatic 
Complaints). Seven of the scales on the CPRS-R are 
derived directly from the Diagnostic and Statistical Man-
ual-IV criteria for ADHD [31]. Behaviors are rated on a 4point 
scale that ranges from 'Very True' to 'Not True'. A t-
score is derived for each scale, based on a large age and 
gender specific normative sample. A t-score (M = 50, SD = 
10) over 65 is considered to indicate moderate to severe 
clinical impairment. 

The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) [32] allows assessment 
of 118 parent-reported behavioral and emotional 
problems of children aged 4–18. Parents rate their child's 
behavior on a 3-point scale (Not True, Somewhat True, or 
Very/Often True). The CBCL includes 8 syndrome scales, 
a Total problem score, and higher order Internalizing and 
Externalizing scales. Internalizing scales include Anxious/ 
Depressed, Withdrawn, and Somatic Complaints. Externalizing 
scales include Aggressive Behavior and Delinquent 
Behavior. Three syndrome scales, Social Problems, 
Thought Problems, and Attention Problems, are not part 
of the internalizing/externalizing dimensions. A t-score 
over 65 was considered to indicate moderate to severe 
clinical impairment. 

Polysomnography 

Home visit procedures and methods for obtaining PSG 
data have been described previously. Briefly, a 2-person 
mixed-gender team arrived at the home approximately 1 
hour prior to the child's typical bedtime. Institutional 
Review Board-approved informed consent was obtained 
from the parent, and an assent form was signed by the 
child. Questionnaires were administered, and anthropo

metric and other physiologic measurements were completed. 
The oral airway was examined by a trained 
technician and rated with a value from 1 (unobstructed) 
to 3 (tonsils encroaching upon airway). Unattended overnight 
polysomnograms were obtained using the Compumedics 
PS-2 system (Abbotsford, Victoria, Australia). The 
following signals were acquired as part of the TuCASA 
montage: C3/A2 and C4/A1 electroencephalogram, right 
and left electrooculogram, a bipolar submental electromyogram, 
thoracic and abdominal displacement (inductive 
plethysmography bands), airflow (nasal/oral 
thermister), nasal pressure cannula, finger pulse oximetry, 
electrocardiogram to detect major arrhythmias (single 
bipolar lead), snoring microphone, body position (mercury 
gauge sensor), and ambient light to determine sleep 
period time (sensor attached to the vest to record on/off). 

The Compumedics software system was used to process 
all PSG data. Scoring has been described in detail previously 
[28]. Briefly, sleep stages were scored according to 
Rechtschaffen and Kales criteria. Arousals were identified 
using criteria published by the American Academy of 
Sleep Medicine. Apneas were scored if the amplitude 
(peak to trough) of the airflow signal using the thermister 
decreased below at least 25% of the amplitude of baseline 
breathing (identified during a period of regular breathing 
with stable oxygen levels), if this change lasted for more 
than 6 seconds or 2 breath cycles. Hypopneas were designated 
if the amplitude of any respiratory signal decreased 
below (approximately) 70% of the amplitude of baseline 
and if the thermister signal did not meet the criterion for 
apnea. Central events were marked if no displacement was 
noted on both the chest and abdominal inductance channels. 
Otherwise, events were scored as obstructive. After 
full scoring, analysis software was used to link each event 
to data from the oxygen saturation and arousals from the 
electroencephalogram channels. 

The Respiratory Disturbance Index (RDI) was used as an 
indicator of SDB and defined as the number of respiratory 
events (apneas and hypopneas) per hour of the total sleep 
time. Breathing "events" were scored during sleep if total 
inspiratory volume went below 50% of baseline and was 
associated with a 3% decrease in blood oxygen levels 
[28,33,34]. For this analysis, a 3% oxygen desaturation 
was required for an event to be counted in the total RDI. 
We considered a child to have SDB if their RDI was greater 
than or equal to 1 event per hour of total sleep time. Use 
of this definition is supported by previous evidence that 
an RDI of one, based on events with a 3% oxygen desaturation, 
is clinically significant [35]. 

Data analyses 

Data were analyzed using SPSS version 13 for Windows 
(SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). One-way ANOVA or Chi2 tests

were used to test differences in demographic statistics 
between overweight and normal weight children. Simple 
odds ratios and adjusted odds ratios were calculated to 
determine the probability of behavior problems given the 
presence of overweight using the behavioral measures 
CBCL and CPRS-R. Adjusted odds ratios were calculated 
for the behavioral measures and controlled for the level of 
sleep disordered breathing using the respiratory disturbance 
index (RDI), described above. 

Results 

Of the 7055 initial surveys distributed throughout the 
schools, 2327 (32.9%) were returned. Of the 1219 
(52.4%) who gave permission to be contacted further, 
503 (41.3%) met inclusion criteria and agreed to participate. 
Of those 503, 480 had sleep studies of sufficient 
quality. Of the 480 sleep studies completed, 402 (83.7%) 
had complete anthropometric and behavioral data. 

Descriptive summary statistics for the sample are in Table 

1. There were approximately equal numbers of boys and 
girls, and more Caucasians than Hispanics. Overweight 
was present in 14.7% of the total sample. There were significantly 
more Hispanic subjects in the overweight 
(55.9%) group compared to the non-overweight group 
(35.6%). Descriptive statistics are provided separately for 
the overweight and normal weight subjects in Table 2. The 
overweight subjects tended to be slightly older than the 
normal weight subjects. Although there was a trend 
toward gender differences, there were no significant differences 
between the groups on RDI, gender, or parent education. 
Table 3 shows percentages of overweight and normal 
weight subjects who were classified as having clinically 
relevant levels of behavioral problems (moderate to 
severe) for the Conners' Parent Rating Scale-Revised 
(CPRS-R). Table 3 includes simple odds ratios indicating 
the probability of overweight children being classified 
with clinically relevant levels of behavior problems. Odds 
ratios, adjusted for SDB, are also shown in Table 3. 
Although odds ratios were significant for several CPRS-R 
scales, confidence intervals were wide and only the Psychosomatic 
scale was statistically significant. Twice as 
many children were classified as having psychosomatic 
complaints in the overweight versus normal weight 
groups. When odds ratios were adjusted for level of SDB, 
psychosomatic complaints were no longer significantly 
different across the groups.

weight subjects who were classified as having clinically 
relevant levels of behavioral problems (moderate to 
severe) for the Child Behavior Checklist, simple odds 
ratios, and adjusted odds ratios controlling for SDB. Sig

nificant unadjusted odds ratios were observed for the 
Withdrawn, Social Problems and Internalizing scales. 
When SDB was controlled, the Withdrawn (3.83, CI 1.59– 
9.22) and Social Problems (2.49, CI 1.14–5.44) odds 
ratios remained significantly different between the 
groups. 

Discussion 

Within this sample, 15% of the subjects were overweight. 
Overweight was more prevalent in Hispanic and male 
subjects. Overweight children had increased parent 
reports of psychosomatic complaints, social problems, 
withdrawal, and general internalizing behaviors. When 
SDB was taken into account, overweight was no longer 
associated with psychosomatic complaints and general 
internalizing symptoms. However, levels of withdrawal 
for the overweight subjects were still almost 4 times 
higher and social problems were 2.5 times higher than 
that of normal weight subjects. Hyperactivity, oppositional, 
and externalizing behaviors were not elevated in 
the overweight group and showed minimal change after 
accounting for SDB. 

While both obesity and SDB may have behavioral consequences, 
each may be related to different types of behavioral 
problems and each may affect behavior through 
unique causal mechanisms. For example, SDB may cause 
externalizing types of behavior problems through associated 
nocturnal hypoxia and disrupted sleep architecture. 
Reactions to and maladaptive coping with functional limitations 
and social stigma may moderate the relationship 
between overweight and behavior problems. The Conners' 
psychosomatic complaints scale, which was related 
to overweight before but not after controlling for SDB, 
included items related to headaches, stomach aches in 
general, stomach aches before school, vague complaints 
that are not supported by physical illness, and fatigue. 
While in overweight children these behaviors may be 
more related to avoidance of school or other social situations, 
vague bodily pain, malaise and fatigue could also be 
related to poor quantity or quality sleep associated with 
sleep disordered breathing. 

The most prevalent problem behaviors reported by parents 
on the CBCL were those related to social problems 
and withdrawal. The CBCL withdrawn scale includes 
items related to shyness, preference for being alone, secretiveness, 
sulking, underactive, sadness, withdrawal, and 
not talking. Although overweight has been hypothesized 
to be a result of some psychiatric symptoms [8], these 
behavioral problems could result from living with overweight. 
Social problems on the CBCL were reported much 
more frequently by parents of overweight children than 
by parents of normal weight children. Social problems 
scale items are related to immaturity, not being liked by

peers, teased by peers, overweight, and clumsiness. Children 
who are overweight may be subject to bullying or 
face functional limitations [36]. They may be ostracized 
by their peers or feel less physically competent compared 
to their peers [17]. Withdrawal may be a reaction to judgment 
by peers or other social problems. 

Oppositional behavior has been linked to chronic overweight, 
when overweight is present from childhood 
through adolescence [11]. The current results do not support 
the idea that oppositional or externalizing behaviors, 
such as aggression, are salient at this developmental stage 
in the context of overweight. Another large cross-sectional 
study that found a relationship between overweight and 
overall behavior problems did not fit specific patterns 
related to externalizing (nor internalizing) problems [8]. 
It may be that the current sample was not chronic enough 
to be at risk for externalizing behaviors. 

A limitation to this study is that only one informant was 
used to measure behavioral problems. Although cross-
informant behavioral agreement is generally low [37], it 
does provide contextual perspectives on behavior and 
may be used to generate alternate explanations for results. 
Additionally, this study is descriptive and the data do not 
allow for strong inferences regarding the etiology of the 
behaviors reported by parents. Finally, more data on these 
families would have been helpful to determine if familial 
nutrition habits, parental obesity, and/or socioeconomic 
status related to behavior problems. However, this study 
did examine a broad variety of problem behaviors derived 
from a population-based sample of school children. Over


weight was defined as age- and gender-specific, however, 
the overweight group was predominantly Hispanic. Epidemiological 
studies have documented the relatively high 
rate of overweight in young Hispanic males found here 
[3]. 

Overweight may contribute to behavior problems independent 
of SDB. It is possible that the behaviors for which 
overweight adds predictive value above SDB are those that 
are influenced by social factors such as teasing or other 
peer behaviors. Overweight children do face discrimination 
and stigmatization and this may impact their global 
self-worth [38-40]. Further research with larger samples 
should examine the extent to which emotional response 
to overweight is moderated by environmental and social 
pressures such as exclusion or individual differences in the 
need for relatedness or social acceptance. 

The current cross- sectional study allows limited causal 
inference. As Freidman and Brownell [41] have emphasized 
in adults, many important questions about etiology 
and treatment may only be answered through longitudinal 
research that allows for an examination of multiple 
risk factors. Although emotional and behavioral problems 
may influence the efficacy of interventions in obesity, 
many trials to date have not measured or examined the 
moderating effect of behavioral problems on outcomes. 
The current study indicates that behaviors associated with 
overweight, such as withdrawal and social problems, may 
need to be taken into account in the design of interventions 
and services as they may act to moderate the efficacy 
of behavioral treatments. Additionally, the predisposition

toward behavioral problems in the context of childhood 
overweight may be influenced by long-term attitudes surrounding 
overweight and the extent of obesity within the 
family. Psychologists and health administrators seeking to 
create services responsive to the rates in U.S. childhood 
overweight could benefit from further information 
regarding the psychosocial mechanisms of any behavioral 
problems. 

Conclusion 

In conclusion, after controlling for the effect of sleep disordered 
breathing, behaviors such as withdrawal and 
social problems, were present in some overweight children 
and should be considered in the design of interventions 
and services as they may act to moderate the efficacy 
of behavioral treatments for obesity.
