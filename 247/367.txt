Background: 
The 
correlation 
between 
obesity 
and 
severity 
of 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
(OSA) 
is 
well 
established 
in 
adults, 
but 
data 
are 
inconsistent 
in 
children. 
We 
hypothesized 
that 
there 
is 
a 
significant 
correlation 
between 
the 
degree 
of 
obesity 
and 
the 
severity 
of 
OSA 
in 
children. 
Methods: 
We 
retrospectively 
reviewed 
records 
of 
weight, 
height, 
history, 
and 
polysomnography 
of 
all 
1-to 
15-year-old 
children 
referred 
to 
our 
sleep 
laboratory. 
Children 
with 
known 
anomalies 
and 
repeated 
polysomnography 
were 
excluded 
from 
this 
study. 
Obesity 
was 
defined 
as 
body 
mass 
index 
z 
score 
(BMI 
Z 
score) 
> 
1.96. 
The 
correlation 
between 
BMI 
Z 
score 
and 
apnea-hypopnea 
index 
(AHI) 
was 
assessed. 
Possible 
confounding 
factors, 
ie, 
age, 
gender, 
and 
tonsil 
size, 
were 
adjusted 
by 
multiple 
linear 
regression. 
Results: 
Four 
hundred 
eighty-two 
children 
were 
included 
in 
this 
study. 
Obese 
children 
had 
a 
significantly 
higher 
AHI 
(median, 
1.5; 
interquartile 
range 
[IQR], 
0.2 
to 
7.0) 
than 
the 
AHI 
of 
nonobese 
children 
(median, 
0.7; 
IQR, 
0.0 
to 
2.5). 
BMI 
Z 
score 
was 
significantly 
correlated 
with 
log-transformed 
AHI 
(Ln[AHI]) 
[r 
. 
0.156, 
p 
. 
0.003]. 
BMI 
Z 
score 
and 
tonsil 
size 
were 
still 
correlated 
with 
Ln(AHI) 
even 
after 
adjusted 
for 
other 
confounding 
factors 
(p 
. 
0.001). 
Conclusion: 
Degree 
of 
obesity 
as 
measured 
by 
BMI 
Z 
score 
and 
tonsil 
size 
are 
significantly 
related 
to 
severity 
of 
OSA 
as 
reflected 
by 
the 
AHI, 
although 
the 
correlation 
is 
mild.

dose-response 
relationship, 
if 
any, 
between 
the 
severity 
of 
OSA 
and 
the 
degree 
of 
obesity 
in 
Chinese 
children, 
as 
ethnic 
origin 
may 
affect 
the 
epidemiology 
and 
pathogenesis 
of 
both 
OSA 
and

Other 
confounding 
factors 
including 
gender, 
age, 
and 
tonsil 
size 
were 
also 
studied. 


Materials 
and 
Methods 


A 
retrospective 
review 
was 
conducted 
of 
all 
children 
aged 
1 
to 
15 
years 
and 
undergoing 
a 
first 
successful 
polysomnography 
from 
August 
1995 
to 
May 
2003 
in 
the 
sleep 
laboratory 
of 
the 
pediatric 
department 
of 
Kwong 
Wah 
Hospital, 
a 
public 
nonteaching 
general 
hospital 
with 
150 
pediatric 
beds. 
Polysomnography 
was 
done 
for 
suspected 
OSA 
as 
judged 
by 
one 
of 
the 
authors 
(D.K.N., 
P.Y.C., 
K.L.K.) 
on 
clinical 
grounds 
that 
usually 
included 
habitual 
snoring 
or 
witnessed 
apnea. 
There 
were 
no 
fixed 
criteria. 
Demographic 
data 
including 
age, 
sex, 
body 
weight, 
and 
height 
were 
analyzed. 
Body 
mass 
index 
(BMI) 
and 
BMI 
z 
score 
(BMI 
Z 
score) 
were 
calculated. 
The 
AHI, 
as 
defined 
below, 
would 
be 
used 
as 
an 
index 
of 
the 
severity 
of 
OSA. 
Allergic 
rhinitis 
or 
asthma 
as 
documented 
in 
the 
medical 
record 
were 
also 
included 
for 
analysis. 
Tonsil 
size 
in 
children 
was 
graded 
as 
suggested 
by 
Brodsky.9 
The 
grading 
was 
summarized 
as 
follows: 
0 
no 
enlargement; 
1 
tonsils 
occupy 
less 
than 
half 
of 
the 
transverse 
diameter 
of 
oropharynx; 
2 
tonsils 
occupy 
half 
of 
the 
transverse 
diameter 
of 
oropharynx; 
3 
tonsils 
occupy 
more 
than 
half 
of 
the 
transverse 
diameter 
of 
oropharynx; 
4 
tonsils 
occupy 
whole 
of 
the 
transverse 
diameter 
of 
oropharynx, 
ie, 
kissing 
tonsils. 


Patients 
with 
craniofacial 
abnormalities, 
chromosomal 
disorders, 
chronic 
lung 
disorders, 
and 
neurologic 
or 
neuromuscular 
diseases 
were 
excluded. 
The 
protocol 
of 
this 
study 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
ethics 
committee 
of 
Kwong 
Wah 
Hospital. 


Polysomnography 


Overnight 
polysomnography 
was 
done 
according 
to 
the 
American 
Thoracic 
Society 
standards10 
(Alice 
3; 
Respironics; 
Murrysville, 
PA; 
or 
Seista; 
Compumedics; 
Abbotsford, 
Australia). 
No 
sedation 
or 
sleep 
deprivation 
were 
used. 
The 
following 
parameters 
were 
recorded 
during 
the 
study: 
(1) 
EEG; 
(2) 
right 
and 
left 
electrooculogram; 
(3) 
submental 
and 
tibial 
electromyogram; 
(4) 
ECG; 
(5) 
oronasal 
airflow 
thermistor 
or 
cannula; 
(6) 
oxygen 
saturation 
monitoring 
(Healthdyne 
Oximeter 
model 
930; 
Respironics); 
(7) 
chest 
and 
abdominal 
wall 
motion 
by 
computer-
assisted 
respiratory 
inductance 
plethysmograph; 
and 
(8) 
snoring 
microphone. 
Sleep 
stages 
were 
determined 
according 
to 
Rechtschaffen 
and 
Kales 
criteria.11 
Arousals 
were 
defined 
as 
recommended 
by 
the 
American 
Academy 
of 
Sleep 
Medicine.12 
Obstructive 
apnea 
was 
defined 
as 
the 
cessation 
of 
airflow 
despite 
breathing 
effort 
for 
more 
than 
two 
respiratory 
cycles. 
Obstructive 
hypopnea 
was 
defined 
as 
the 
decrease 
of 
airflow 
by 
50% 
but 
80% 
of 
baseline 
associated 
with 
desaturation 
of 
. 
4% 
or 
arousal 
despite 
breathing 
effort. 
The 
AHI, 
denoting 
the 
number 
of 
episodes 
of 
obstructive 
apnea 
and 
hypopnea 
per 
hour, 
was 
calculated. 


OSA 
was 
defined 
as 
an 
AHI 
5/h 
in 
adults,13 
and 
patients 
with 
AHI 
. 
5 
were 
classified 
as 
primary 
snorers, 
ie, 
snorers 
with 
normal 
polysomnography 
results. 
In 
children, 
an 
apnea 
index 
1 
was 
statistically 
abnormal,14 
and 
the 
upper 
limit 
of 
AHI 
was 
reported 
to 
be 
1.5.15 
In 
the 
current 
study, 
AHI 
1.5 
was 
used 
to 
define 
OSA. 


Obesity 


BMI 
was 
used 
to 
quantify 
the 
adiposity. 
In 
childhood, 
BMI 
is 
strongly 
influenced 
by 
gender 
and 
age 
and 
changes 
with 
age; 
an 
absolute 
cut-off 
value 
to 
define 
obesity 
in 
children 
of 
different 
ages 
is 
therefore 
not 
feasible. 
Although 
pediatric 
BMI 
percentile 
curves 
are 
available, 
their 
application 
in 
parametric 
statistical 
procedures 
is 
compromised 
by 
the 
skewed 
distribution. 
We 
transformed 
an 
individual 
child’s 
BMI 
value 
to 
z 
score 
based 
on 
the 
gender 
and 
age-specific 
smoothed 
measure 
of 
skewness, 
median, 
and 
the 
coefficient 
of 
variation 
values 
of 
Chinese 
children16 
by 
using 
the 
equation 
suggested 
by 
Cole.17 
Obesity 
was 
defined 
as 
BMI 
Z 
score 
1.96 
in 
our 
study, 
and 
2.5% 
of 
normal 
children 
were 
expected 
to 
have 
such 
a 
BMI 
Z 
score. 


Statistical 
Analysis 


Data 
from 
patients 
were 
transferred 
to 
a 
computer 
for 
statistical 
analysis 
(SPSS 
11.0, 
Macintosh 
Version; 
SPSS; 
Chicago, 
IL). 
Descriptive 
statistics 
were 
done. 
The 
distribution 
of 
data 
was 
assessed 
by 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov 
test 
with 
Liliefors 
significance 
correction. 
Data 
were 
logarithm 
transformed 
before 
the 
multivariate 
analysis 
if 
the 
data 
were 
not 
normally 
distributed. 
Patients 
were 
stratified 
into 
obese 
and 
nonobese 
groups 
to 
compare 
the 
AHI 
by 
Mann-Whitney 
U 
test. 
The 
prevalence 
of 
OSA, 
asthma, 
and 
allergic 
rhinitis 
between 
the 
two 
groups 
was 
compared 
by 
Fisher 
Exact 
Test. 
The 
association 
of 
prevalence 
of 
OSA 
and 
tonsil 
size 
was 
assessed 
by 
2 
test 
for 
trend. 


Correlation 
between 
AHI 
and 
BMI 
Z 
score 
was 
assessed 
by 
Pearson 
correlation. 
A 
correlation 
coefficient 
0.1 
was 
considered 
a 
positive 
correlation. 
Multiple 
linear 
regression 
with 
univariate 
analysis 
of 
covariance 
was 
done 
to 
identify 
predictors 
of 
AHI. 
BMI 
Z 
score, 
tonsil 
size, 
age, 
and 
gender 
were 
entered 
as 
independent 
variables. 
The 
percentage 
of 
variance 
of 
AHI 
independently 
explained 
by 
the 
predictors 
was 
derived 
from 
Eta2 
(partial 
R2). 


The 
null 
hypothesis 
of 
our 
study 
was 
absence 
of 
correlation 
between 
BMI 
Z 
score 
and 
AHI 
(r 
. 
0.1). 
An 
alternative 
hypothesis 
is 
r 
0.1 
with 
0.05 
and 
0.8. 
The 
minimum 
sample 
size 
required 
for 
our 
study 
is 
a 
total 
number 
of 
85. 


Results 


A 
total 
of 
705 
polysomnography 
reports 
were 
reviewed. 
Two 
hundred 
twenty-three

were 
excluded 
by 
the

Discussion 


In 
our 
study, 
we 
demonstrated 
a 
significant, 
though 
mild, 
correlation 
between 
OSA 
as 
measured 
by 
AHI 
and 
the 
degree 
of 
obesity 
as 
reflected 
by 
the 
BMI 
Z 
score. 
We 
also 
demonstrated 
that 
in 
children, 
tonsillar 
hypertrophy 
is 
an 
important 
risk 
factor 
for 
OSA. 
The 
pathogenesis 
of 
OSA 
in 
children 
included 
a 
complex 
interplay 
of 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy, 
neuromuscular 
tone, 
anatomy 
of 
the 
airway, 
and 
obesity.8 
Hence, 
it 
should 
not 
be 
surprising 
that 
obesity 
was 
found 
to 
have 
only 
a 
mild 
correlation 
with 
AHI 
in 
the 
current 
study. 


Available 
literature 
on 
the 
correlation 
between 
severity 
of 
childhood 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
(SDB) 
and 
degree 
of 
obesity 
was 
inconsistent. 
Marcus 
et 
al4 
demonstrated 
a 
significant 
correlation 
between 
percentage 
of 
ideal 
weight 
for 
height 
with 
apnea 
index 
in 
a 
group 
of 
obese 
children 
and 
adolescents. 
However, 
the 
studies 
by 
Mallory 
et 
al6 
and 
Silvestri 
et 
al7 
demonstrated 
no 
correlation. 
The 
inconsistency 
was 
possibly 
due 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
only 
obese 
children 
were 
studied 
in 
the 
above 
three 
studies. 
Brooks 
et 
al5 
addressed 
this 
issue 
by 
including 
obese 
children 
as 
well 
as 
nonobese 
counterpart, 
and 
a 
significant 
correlation 
between

AHI) 
was 
found 
(r

The 
above 
four 
studies, 
however, 
were 
limited 
by 
the 
small 
sample 
size 
(. 
50 
patients 
each). 
The 
current 
series 
addressed 
the 
issue 
with 
a 
large 
sample 
size. 


Another 
reason 
for 
the 
inconsistent 
result 
in 
previous 
studies 
could 
be 
the 
skewed 
distribution 
of 
variables, 
eg, 
body 
weight, 
apnea 
index, 
and 
AHI. 
The 
skewed 
distribution 
of 
these 
variables 
may 
violate 
the 
basic 
assumption 
of 
parametric 
analysis 
used 
in 
the 
studies, 
ie, 
Pearson 
correlation 
and 
multiple 
linear 
regression.

the

satisfying 
the 
requirement 
for 
parametric 
analysis. 


Compared 
with 
the 
current 
study, 
Brooks 
et 
al5 
demonstrated 
a 
much 
stronger 
positive 
correlation 
between 
AHI 
and 
percentage 
of 
ideal 
weight 
for

(percentage 
of

[r

. 
0.001], 
compared 
with 
the 
correlation 
(r 
. 
0.156, 
p 
. 
0.003) 
between 
Ln(AHI) 
and 
BMI 
Z 
score 
in 
the 
current 
study. 
This 
was 
most 
likely 
due 
to 
the 
difference 
in 
the 
two 
studied 
populations. 
Our 
patients 
were 
older, 
a 
median 
age 
of 
6 
years 
vs 
mean 
age 
of 
4.5 
to 
5 
years 
in 
the 
study 
by 
Brooks 
et 
al,5 
in 
which 
the 
SD 
of 
percentage 
of 
ideal 
body 
weight 
for 
height 
was 
12 
in 
the 
low-AHI 
group, 
while 
the 
SD 
was 
57.2 
in 
the 
high-AHI 
group. 
In 
contrast, 
the 
BMI 
Z 
score 
distribution 
between 
non-OSA 
and 
OSA 
groups 
was 
similar 
in 
the 
current 
study 
(SD 
. 
1.82 
in 
the 
non-OSA 
group 
vs 
SD 
. 
1.61 
in 
the 
OSA 
group) 
[data 
not 
shown 
in 
results]. 
In 
addition, 
the 
discrepancy 
might 
be 
attributed 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
all 
the 
current 
study 
children 
were 
Chinese. 
Redline 
et 
al18 
reported 
ethnic 
difference 
in 
the 
prevalence 
of 
SDB, 
with 
African 
Americans 
being 
more 
prone 
to 
have 
SDB. 
A 
recent 
study 
by 
Kumar 
et 
al19 
reports 
that 
the 
distribution 
of 
fat 
in 
obese 
adults 
was 
found 
to 
be 
ethnic 
and 
gender 
dependent. 


Original 
Research 



Further 
studies 
should 
be 
undertaken 
to 
evaluate 
the 
role 
of 
ethnic 
difference 
in 
obesity 
and 
the 
pathogenesis 
of 
SDB. 


The 
current 
study 
only 
demonstrated 
a 
mild 
though 
significant 
correlation 
between 
obesity 
and 
sleep 
apnea. 
This 
again 
illustrates 
that 
the 
pathogenesis 
of 
OSA 
in 
children 
is 
complex, 
with 
other 
factors 
playing 
important 
roles 
eg, 
the 
amount 
of 
fat 
around 
neck, 
and 
the 
size 
of 
tonsils 
and 
adenoid.20 
Horner 
et 
al21 
showed 
that 
more 
fat 
was 
present 
in 
the 
area 
surrounding 
the 
collapsible 
segment 
of 
the 
pharynx 
in 
adults 
with 
OSA, 
compared 
to 
equally 
obese 
control 
subjects 
without 
OSA. 
Mortimore 
et 
al22 
found 
that 
even 
relatively 
nonobese 
adults 
with 
OSA 
had 
excess 
fat 
deposition, 
especially 
anterolateral 
to 
the 
upper 
airway 
when 
compared 
with 
control 
subjects 
with 
the 
same 
level 
of 
obesity 
as 
defined 
by 
BMI 
and 
neck 
circumference. 
However, 
parapharyngeal 
fat 
as 
a 
contributing 
factor 
to 
OSA 
in 
obese 
children 
and 
adolescents 
has 
not 
been 
substantiated. 
Moreover, 
using 
BMI 
Z 
score 
as 
an 
index 
of 
obesity 
may 
not 
reflect 
the 
distribution 
of 
fat 
around 
the 
pharynx 
that 
determines 
the 
upper-airway 
patency 
during 
sleep. 
In 
children, 
measurements 
of 
neck 
and 
waist 
circumference 
were 
not 
a 
standard 
practice 
and 
no 
reference 
values 
were 
available. 
These 
measures 
would 
be 
helpful 
data 
in 
future 
studies 
of 
this 
area 
to 
confirm 
the 
role 
of 
parapharyngeal 
fat 
in 
childhood 
OSA.20 


We 
evaluated 
the 
impact 
of 
tonsil 
size 
on 
the 
severity 
of 
OSA. 
Some 
of 
the 
previous 
studies5,23–25 
failed 
to 
establish 
a 
correlation 
between 
tonsil 
size 
by 
clinical 
inspection 
and 
different 
parameters 
of 
OSA. 
In 
other 
studies5,26 
using 
radiologic 
assessment 
of 
adenoidal-nasopharyngeal 
ratio, 
correlation 
with 
OSA 
indexes 
was 
also 
not 
established. 
Nevertheless, 
the 
study 
by 
Li 
et 
al25 
found 
a 
strong 
correlation 
between 
radiologic 
assessment 
of 
the 
tonsillar-pharyngeal 
ratio 
and 
the 
AHI 
in 
children 
with 
OSA 
syndrome 
(OSAS). 
Arens 
et 
al27 
used 
MRI 
to 
analyze 
upper-airway 
size 
of 
young 
children 
with 
OSAS 
(mean 
AHI, 
8.4 
. 
9.5) 
and 
matching 
control 
subjects. 
They 
found 
that 
children 
with 
OSAS 
had 
a 
significantly 
decreased 
cross-sectional 
area 
of 
airway 
adjacent 
to 
adenoid 
and 
tonsils. 
In 
the 
current 
study, 
we 
demonstrated 
that 
simple 
clinical 
staging 
of 
the 
tonsil 
size 
was 
correlated 
with 
the 
AHI; 
and 
previous 
negative 
study 
findings 
were 
most 
likely 
due 
to 
type 
II 
error, 
as 
the 
population 
of 
the 
current 
study 
was 
bigger 
than 
previous 
studies5,23–25 
that 
recruited 
from 
22 
to 
50 
children 
only. 


Similar 
to 
previous 
pediatric 
studies,4–7 
the 
current 
study 
population 
was 
not 
recruited 
from 
the 
general 
population. 
All 
subjects 
were 
referred 
to 
our 
sleep 
laboratory 
for 
suspected 
OSA. 
This 
clinic 
population 
may 
be 
dissimilar 
to 
the 
general 
population, 


and 
the 
conclusion 
of 
this 
study 
may 
not 
be 
applicable 
to 
the 
general 
population. 
Further 
studies 
should 
also 
include 
subjects 
from 
the 
general 
population. 


In 
conclusion, 
our 
study 
represents 
the 
largest 
series 
to 
date 
of 
children 
who 
underwent 
polysomnography. 
A 
positive 
dose-response 
correlation 
between 
AHI 
(a 
marker 
of 
OSA) 
and 
BMI 
Z 
score 
(a 
marker 
of 
obesity) 
is 
established. 
We 
also 
found 
that 
clinical 
staging 
of 
tonsil 
size 
was 
a 
useful 
measure 
to 
predict 
OSA. 
With 
the 
increased 
prevalence 
of 
obesity 
in 
children 
worldwide,28 
the 
increase 
in 
prevalence 
of 
associated 
morbidity 
like 
OSA 
should 
be 
anticipated. 
The 
combined 
effect 
of 
obesity 
and 
OSAS 
on 
the 
cardiovascular 
system 
is 
worrying,29 
and 
active 
education 
of 
both 
medical 
doctors 
and 
the 
general 
public 
is 
important 
to 
contain 
the 
impacts.
