ABSTRACT. 
Objectives. 
Sleep 
patterns 
and 
sleep 
problems 
in 
children 
are 
not 
only 
influenced 
by 
a 
large 
number 
of 
biological 
and 
psychologic 
factors 
but 
also 
by 
cultural 
and 
social 
factors. 
Little 
is 
known 
about 
similarities 
and 
differences 
in 
sleep 
patterns 
and 
sleep 
problems 
among 
children 
across 
countries. 
We 
attempted 
to 
compare 
sleep 
patterns 
and 
sleep 
problems 
among 
schoolchildren 
from 
2 
countries 
with 
distinctive 
cultural 
contexts: 
the 
United 
States 
and 
China. 


Methods. 
The 
data 
come 
from 
2 
cross-sectional 
surveys 
in 
3 
elementary 
schools 
of 
Jinan 
City, 
People’s 
Republic 
of 
China, 
and 
3 
elementary 
schools 
from 
a 
suburban 
school 
district 
in 
southeastern 
New 
England, 
United 
States. 
The 
Chinese 
sample 
consisted 
of 
517 
elementary 
school 
children 
(grades 
1 
to 
5), 
and 
the 
US 
sample 
consisted 
of 
494 
elementary 
school 
children 
(grades 
kindergarten 
through 
4). 
We 
used 
the 
Children’s 
Sleep 
Habits 
Questionnaire 
(CSHQ) 
to 
assess 
children’s 
sleep 
patterns 
and 
sleep 
problems 
as 
reported 
by 
parents. 
Parents 
of 
the 
Chinese 
sample 
completed 
a 
Chinese 
version 
of 
the 
CSHQ. 


Results. 
For 
children 
in 
both 
the 
US 
and 
Chinese 
samples, 
reported 
bedtime 
was 
delayed 
and 
sleep 
duration 
decreased 
with 
increasing 
age. 
Compared 
with 
the 
US 
children 
(grades 
1–4), 
Chinese 
children 
went 
to 
bed 
approximately 
half 
an 
hour 
later 
(9:02 
vs 
8:27 
PM) 
and 
woke 
up 
half 
an 
hour 
earlier 
(6:28 
vs 
6:55 
AM), 
resulting 
in 
an 
average 
sleep 
duration 
that 
was 
1 
hour 
less 
(9.25 
vs 


10.15 
hours). 
Chinese 
children 
were 
rated 
significantly 
higher 
than 
the 
US 
children 
on 
almost 
all 
CSHQ 
scales, 
indicating 
more 
sleep 
problems 
in 
Chinese 
children. 
Common 
sleep 
problems 
observed 
for 
all 
children 
were 
difficulty 
falling 
asleep, 
having 
a 
fear 
of 
sleeping 
in 
the 
dark, 
sleep 
talking, 
restless 
sleep, 
teeth 
grinding 
during 
sleep, 
and 
daytime 
sleepiness. 
Shorter 
daily 
sleep 
duration 
was 
associated 
with 
difficulty 
falling 
asleep, 
struggling 
at 
bedtime, 
and 
trouble 
sleeping 
away 
for 
the 
US 
children, 
and 
with 
going 
to 
bed 
at 
different 
times 
and 
having 
a 
fear 
of 
sleeping 
alone 
for 
Chinese 
children. 
Short 
sleep 
duration 
was 
a 
main 
predictor 
of 
daytime 
sleepiness 
for 
Chinese 
children, 
whereas 
restless 
sleep 
and 
snoring 
predicted 
daytime 
sleepiness 
for 
the 
US 
children.

Conclusions. 
As 
reported 
by 
parents, 
children 
in 
China 
went 
to 
bed 
later 
and 
woke 
up 
earlier 
and 
their 
sleep 
duration 
was 
1 
hour 
shorter 
than 
the 
US 
children. 
Chinese 
children 
were 
reported 
to 
have 
more 
sleep 
problems 
than 
their 
US 
counterparts. 
Daytime 
sleepiness 
was 
determined 
by 
sleep 
duration 
only 
for 
those 
who 
slept 
insufficiently. 
Unique 
school 
schedules 
and 
sleep 
practices 
may 
contribute 
to 
the 
differences 
in 
the 
sleep 
patterns 
and 
sleep 
problems 
of 
children 
from 
the 
United 
States 
and 
China.

plays 
very 
important 
roles

children’s 
development. 
Sleep 
not 
only 
impacts 
on 
physical 
growth, 
behavior, 
and 
emotional 
development 
but 
also 
is 
closely 
related 
to 
cognitive 
functioning, 
learning, 
and 
attention.1–3 
Sleep 
disorders 
in 
children 
are 
not 
uncommon. 
In 
a 
number 
of 
survey 
studies, 
parents 
report 
sleep 
disturbances 
throughout 
childhood, 
with 
the 
prevalence 
seeming 
to 
be 
20% 
to 
30%.1,4–8 
Sleep 
patterns 
and 
sleep 
problems 
in 
children 
are 
not 
only 
influenced 
by 
a 
large 
number 
of 
biological 
and 
psychologic 
factors 
but 
also 
by 
cultural, 
social, 
and 
family 
factors.9–11 
However, 
most 
epidemiologic 
studies 
of 
sleep 
patterns 
and 
sleep 
problems 
have 
been 
of 
Western 
children.6,11–13 
Although 
several 
studies 
have 
examined 
ethnocultural 
differences 
in 
sleep 
practices 
and/or 
sleep 
disturbances 
in 
US 
children 
and 
adolescents,11,14,15 
few 
studies 
have 
compared 
sleep 
patterns 
and 
sleep 
problems 
among 
children 
across 
countries 
using 
the 
same 
standardized 
sleep 
instruments.16 
This 
study 
represents 
the 
first 
comparison 
of 
sleep 
patterns 
and 
sleep 
problems 
among 
children 
from 
the 
United 
States 
and 
China, 
representing 
2 
distinctive 
cultural 
contexts: 
Western 
and 
Asian. 


Western 
child-rearing 
practices 
emphasize 
the 
development 
of 
independence 
and 
individualism, 
whereas 
Asian 
culture 
stresses 
the 
development 
of 
interpersonal 
relations, 
collectivism, 
family 
closeness, 
and 
social 
harmony.17 
These 
child-rearing 
beliefs 
and 
cultural 
characteristics 
may 
determine 
child-rearing 
and 
family 
sleep 
practices. 
For 
example, 
cosleeping 
with 
parents 
in 
young 
children 
is 
accepted 
and 
very 
common 
in 
many 
Asian 
countries. 
In 
China, 
all-night 
cosleeping 
during 
the 
infant 
and 
early 
childhood 
years 
is 
the 
norm, 
decreases 
in 
prevalence 
with 
increasing 
age, 
and 
is 
reportedly 
unusual

after 
puberty. 
A 
recent 
study 
of 
school-aged 
children 
in 
urban 
China 
reported 
that 
the 
prevalence 
of 
regular 
bed 
sharing 
was 
18.2% 
and 
as 
high 
as 
55.8% 
in 
7-year-olds.18 
In 
a 
study 
of 
bed 
sharing 
in 
Korean 
children, 
Yang 
and 
Hahn19 
found 
that 
73.5% 
of 
mothers 
approved 
of 
bed 
sharing 
between 
3 
to 
6 
years 
of 
age. 
The 
main 
reasons 
for 
bed 
sharing 
were 
“to 
look 
after 
the 
child 
while 
sleeping” 
and 
“the 
child 
is 
too 
young 
to 
sleep 
alone.”19(p155) 
In 
Western 
countries, 
however, 
cosleeping 
has 
been 
considered 
somewhat 
of 
a 
cultural 
taboo, 
and 
in 
many 
of 
these 
countries 
it 
is 
a 
norm 
for 
a 
child 
to 
sleep 
separately 
from 
the 
parents 
after 
birth. 
In 
the 
United 
States, 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
certain 
ethnic 
and 
racial 
groups 
(particularly 
Hispanics 
and 
African 
Americans11), 
regular 
cosleeping 
with 
parents 
in 
non-Hispanic 
white 
families 
is 
uncommon 
in 
these 
societies. 
A 
recent 
US 
national 
survey 
between 
1993 
and 
2000 
indicated 
that 
only 
9.2% 
of 
infants 
usually 
shared 
a 
bed 
with 
parents.20 
Many 
Western 
child 
health 
professionals 
emphasize 
the 
hazards 
of 
cosleeping, 
such 
as 
impediment 
of 
the 
development 
of 
autonomy 
and 
independence, 
increased 
dependence 
on 
parents, 
inappropriate 
sexual 
arousal, 
risk 
of 
sleep 
problems, 
and 
interference 
with 
parental 
sexuality 
and 
intimacy.
19,21 
There 
is 
evidence 
that 
cosleeping 
is 
related 
to 
children’s 
sleep 
patterns, 
sleep 
disturbances, 
and 
daytime 
sleepiness.18,22 


Research 
has 
indicated 
that 
there 
seems 
to 
be 
marked 
cultural 
variations 
in 
the 
time 
of 
going 
to 
bed 
and 
amount 
of 
time 
slept.23 
In 
a 
study 
of 
cultural 
differences 
in 
sleep 
habits 
and 
complaints 
of 
40303 
11-to 
16-year-old 
European 
children 
from 
11 
countries, 
Tynjala 
et 
al16 
reported 
that 
sleep 
habits 
varied 
significantly 
between 
countries, 
with 
Israeli 
children 
sleeping 
the 
shortest 
and 
Swiss 
children 
sleeping 
the 
longest. 
School 
start 
time 
may 
contribute 
to 
the 
differences 
in 
sleep 
duration 
between 
countries.24 
Compared 
with 
the 
United 
States, 
elementary 
schools 
in 
China 
start 
at 
an 
earlier 
time, 
at 
7:30 
am, 
and 
children 
spend 
more 
time 
in 
school 
and 
studying 
at 
home 
because 
of 
increased 
homework 
demands 
and 
the 
emphasis 
on 
academic 
achievement 
in 
Chinese 
culture.25,26 
Obviously, 
an 
early 
start 
time 
for 
school 
requires 
an 
even 
earlier 
waking 
time, 
and 
nighttime 
homework 
may 
result 
in 
a 
later 
bedtime, 
which 
in 
turn 
may 
result 
in 
shorter 
sleep 
duration 
and 
consequent 
daytime 
sleepiness 
in 
Chinese 
children. 


Another 
cultural 
characteristic 
of 
sleep 
habits 
in 
China 
is 
napping 
after 
lunch. 
In 
China, 
almost 
all 
schools 
have 
a 
long 
lunch 
break, 
2 
hours, 
between 


12:00 
and 
2:00 
pm. 
Although 
there 
are 
no 
statistical 
data 
available, 
anecdotally, 
many 
students 
have 
a 
30-minute 
to 
1-hour 
nap 
after 
lunch 
either 
at 
school 
or 
at 
home. 
Some 
students 
go 
home 
for 
lunch 
and 
may 
have 
a 
nap 
at 
home; 
others 
have 
lunch 
and 
may 
nap 
at 
school. 
Generally 
speaking, 
most 
people 
in 
China 
perceive 
the 
purpose 
of 
taking 
a 
nap 
after 
lunch 
not 
specifically 
as 
compensation 
for 
a 
shortened 
night 
sleep 
duration 
but 
for 
restoration 
and 
recovery 
of 
energy 
and 
spirit. 
Recent 
experimental 
studies 
have 
demonstrated 
favorable 
effects 
of 
brief 
naps 
on 
following 
alertness 
and 
cognitive 
performance 
in 
young 
adults.27–29 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
it 
is 
known 
that 
long 
naps 
may 
also 
have 
negative 
effects 
on 
night 
sleep, 
such 
as 
sleep 
onset 
and 
sleep 
quality 
and 
quantity. 


In 
addition, 
China 
(as 
a 
developing 
country) 
differs 
greatly 
from 
the 
United 
States 
in 
socioeconomic 
status 
(SES), 
which 
may 
have 
a 
unique 
contribution 
to 
sleep 
practices 
and 
sleep 
problems 
among 
Chinese 
families. 
For 
example, 
compared 
with 
the 
United 
States, 
urban 
residents 
of 
China 
have 
few 
choices 
of 
housing, 
and 
living 
space 
is 
very 
crowded 
because 
of 
financial 
restriction 
and 
rapid 
population 
growth. 
Most 
urban 
families 
with 
young 
children 
are 
residing 
in 
an 
apartment, 
possibly 
with 
only 
1 
bedroom, 
which 
may 
prevent 
the 
child 
from 
having 
his/her 
own 
room 
or 
bed 
and 
increase 
the 
likelihood 
of 
bed 
sharing 
with 
parents 
and 
sleep 
problems 
caused 
by 
parental 
night 
activities. 
Moreover, 
almost 
all 
the 
families 
in 
urban 
China 
have 
only 
1 
child 
because 
of 
the 
1-child 
family-planning 
policy. 
Only 
children 
may 
be 
more 
likely 
to 
be 
overindulged 
(“the 
little 
emperor”) 
and/or 
overprotected, 
and 
parents 
(and 
grandparents) 
may 
have 
more 
difficulties 
setting 
limits.30 
These 
characteristics 
may 
increase 
the 
likelihood 
of 
the 
child 
cosleeping 
with 
his 
or 
her 
parents 
and 
may 
decrease 
sleep 
quality 
and 
duration. 


Despite 
these 
cultural 
and 
socioeconomic 
differences, 
little 
is 
known 
about 
the 
similarities 
and 
differences 
in 
sleep 
patterns 
and 
sleep 
problems 
between 
the 
US 
and 
Chinese 
children. 
We 
report 
here 
2 
school-based 
studies 
of 
children 
in 
the 
United 
States 
and 
China 
with 
the 
same 
sleep 
measure 
that 
allows 
us 
to 
(1) 
compare 
sleep 
patterns 
(bedtime, 
morning 
wakeup 
time, 
sleep 
duration) 
and 
sleep 
problems 
as 
reported 
by 
parents 
between 
children 
from 
China 
and 
the 
United 
States, 
(2) 
examine 
sleep 
problems 
that 
are 
associated 
with 
sleep 
duration 
among 
children 
from 
different 
cultural 
contexts, 
and 
(3) 
examine 
the 
relationship 
between 
sleep 
duration 
and 
sleep 
problems 
and 
daytime 
sleepiness 
for 
the 
US 
and 
Chinese 
children. 
We 
hypothesized 
that 
Chinese 
children 
would 
go 
to 
bed 
later, 
wake 
up 
earlier, 
and 
sleep 
less 
than 
the 
US 
children 
because 
of 
earlier 
school 
start 
time 
and 
heavier 
homework 
load. 
We 
also 
hypothesized 
that 
the 
parents 
of 
Chinese 
children 
would 
report 
more 
sleep 
problems 
than 
parents 
of 
the 
US 
children 
because 
of 
potentially 
increased 
parental 
awareness 
of 
sleep 
issues 
as 
a 
result 
of 
bed 
sharing 
or 
room 
sharing 
with 
the 
child. 
Finally, 
we 
expected 
that 
daytime 
sleepiness 
for 
both 
groups 
of 
children 
would 
be 
predicted 
by 
shorter 
sleep 
duration.

sampled 
from 
3

children 
are 
generally 
admitted 
to 
school 
at 
6

students, 
especially 
first-or 
second-graders, 
often 
stay 
at 
school 
during 
the 
lunch 
break 
and 
may 
nap 
after 
lunch. 
This 
survey 
was 
conducted 
in 
the 
spring 
of 
2001, 
at 
which 
time 
the 
lunch 
break 
was 
90 
minutes. 
Students 
have 
to 
do 
1 
to 
3 
hours 
of 
homework 
almost 
every 
day 
including 
weekends 
and 
holidays. 
Homework 
increases 
with 
grade 
level. 
Most 
students 
also 
watch 
television 
after 
school, 
before, 
during, 
or 
after 
dinner. 
Unfortunately, 
no 
statistical 
data 
are 
available. 


Detailed 
sampling 
procedures 
and 
methodology 
have 
been 
reported 
elsewhere.18 
Briefly, 
the 
aims 
of 
the 
survey 
were 
explained 
to 
school 
principals 
and 
teachers 
in 
the 
target 
schools, 
and 
permission 
was 
obtained 
to 
conduct 
the 
survey, 
as 
is 
standard 
practice 
in 
China. 
One 
class 
from 
each 
grade 
for 
each 
school 
was 
selected 
randomly, 
yielding 
a 
pool 
of 
565 
children 
as 
potential 
participants. 
The 
children 
were 
asked 
by 
teachers 
to 
take 
a 
questionnaire 
to 
their 
parents 
with 
a 
letter 
explaining 
the 
project 
and 
requesting 
the 
parents 
to 
complete 
the 
questionnaire. 
The 
parents 
also 
were 
told 
that 
participation 
in 
the 
survey 
was 
voluntary. 
Of 
the 
565 
sampled 
children, 
517 
(92%) 
returned 
completed 
questionnaires 
for 
statistical 
analysis. 
This 
sample 
consisted 
of 
47% 
boys, 
and 
mean 
age 
was 
11.0 
years 
(SD: 
1.9; 
range: 
7–13 
years). 
Because 
in 
China 
there 
are 
no 
established 
systems 
to 
assess 
the 
SES 
of 
individual 
families, 
parental 
education 
levels 
were 
used 
as 
an 
indicator 
of 
family 
SES. 
In 
this 
sample, 
parental 
education 
levels 
were 
distributed 
as 
middle 
school 
or 
less 
(10.8%), 
high 
school 
(31.7%), 
some 
college 
(22.4%), 
and 
university 
(35.0%) 
for 
fathers 
and 
middle 
school 
or 
less 
(18.8%), 
high 
school 
(38.6%), 
some 
college 
(24.6%), 
and 
college 
graduate 
(17.9%) 
for 
mothers. 
The 
higher-education 
levels 
of 
the 
parents 
indicate 
that 
this 
sample 
represents 
a 
group 
of 
children 
from 
families 
of 
at 
least 
middle 
or 
high 
SES 
in 
urban 
China. 


US 
Sample 


The 
US 
sample 
consisted 
of 
494 
children 
who 
were 
enrolled 
in 
kindergarten 
through 
fourth 
grade 
from 
3 
public 
elementary 
schools 
in 
a 
predominantly 
white, 
middle-income, 
English-speaking 
suburban 
school 
district 
in 
southeastern 
New 
England.6,31,32 
In 
the 
school 
system 
studied, 
kindergarten 
consisted 
of 
half-day 
sessions, 
with 
students 
equally 
distributed 
between 
morning 
(8: 
50–11:30 
am) 
and 
afternoon 
(12:30–2:45 
pm) 
sessions 
for 
a 
half 
year 
each. 
For 
children 
in 
grades 
1 
to 
4, 
school 
hours 
were 
between 


8:50 
am 
and 
2:45 
pm. 
There 
was 
a 
half-hour 
lunch 
period 
between 
the 
morning 
and 
afternoon 
classes. 
Although 
children 
were 
encouraged 
to 
nap 
for 
a 
1-hour 
period 
in 
kindergarten, 
data 
were 
not 
collected 
specifically 
regarding 
the 
duration 
of 
any 
scheduled 
naps. 
Of 
1099 
questionnaire 
packets 
mailed 
to 
the 
parents 
of 
children 
in 
the 
3 
elementary 
schools, 
494 
children 
returned 
usable 
questionnaires 
for 
data 
analysis 
(response 
rate: 
46.9%). 
Mean 
age 
of 
the 
sample 
was 
7.56 
years 
(SD: 
1.51; 
range: 
4.83–11.00 
years). 
There 
were 
240 
boys 
(51.2%) 
and 
229 
girls 
(48.8%). 
SES 
was 
determined 
by 
using 
the 
Hollingshead 
Form 
Index 
of 
Social 
Status 
(A.B. 
Hollingshead, 
PhD, 
Four-Factor 
Index 
of 
Social 
Status, 
unpublished 
paper, 
1975), 
which 
is 
based 
on 
occupation 
and 
education. 
The 
mean 
Hollingshead 
SES 
was 
45.5 
(SD: 
11.3; 
class 
4). 


Daily 
television-viewing 
data 
for 
this 
sample 
were 
also 
obtained 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
sleep 
study; 
mean 
reported 
television-
viewing 
time 
on 
weekdays 
was 
2.07 
hours 
(SD: 
1.32). 
The 
amount 
of 
television 
viewed 
in 
this 
sample 
did 
not 
differ 
significantly 
by 
age 
but 
was 
higher 
in 
boys 
(2 
5.67, 
P 
.05) 
and 
in 
families 
of 
lower 
SES 
(t 
3.62, 
P 
.001).32 


Measure 
of 
Sleep 
Patterns 
and 
Sleep 
Problems 


The 
Children’s 
Sleep 
Habits 
Questionnaire 
(CSHQ)31 
was 
used 
to 
assess 
sleep 
patterns 
and 
sleep 
problems 
of 
children 
in 
the 
United 
States 
and 
China. 
The 
CSHQ 
consists 
of 
33 
sleep-disturbance 
items 
and 
3 
items 
asking 
for 
information 
about 
sleep 
patterns 
(ie, 
bedtime, 
morning 
wakeup 
time, 
and 
daily 
total 
sleep 
duration). 
Parents 
are 
asked 
to 
recall 
the 
child’s 
sleep 
behaviors 
over 
a 
“typical” 
recent 
week. 
Items 
are 
rated 
on 
a 
3-point 
scale: 
“usually” 
if 
the 
sleep 
behavior 
occurred 
5 
to 
7 
times 
per 
week; 
“sometimes” 
for 
2 
to 
4 
times 
per 
week; 
and 
“rarely” 
for 
0 
to 
1 
time 
per 
week. 
The 
33 
sleep-disturbance 
items 
were 
conceptually 
grouped 
into 
8 
subscales: 
bedtime 
resistance, 
sleep-onset 
delay, 
sleep 
duration, 
sleep 
anxiety, 
night 
wakings, 
parasomnias, 
sleep-
disordered 
breathing, 
and 
daytime 
sleepiness. 
The 
CSHQ 
has 
satisfactory 
psychometric 
properties 
in 
US 
children.31 


We 
developed 
a 
Chinese 
version 
of 
the 
CSHQ 
by 
translation 
and 
back 
translation 
for 
this 
study. 
Cronbach’s 
. 
using 
data 
from 
these 
Chinese 
children 
was 
.80 
for 
the 
entire 
scale 
and 
.49 
to 
.72 
for 
the 
subscales. 
The 
psychometric 
properties 
of 
the 
Chinese 
CSHQ 
with 
this 
sample 
are 
comparable 
to 
those 
found 
in 
US 
children 
for 
most 
of 
the 
subscales.18,31 


Statistical 
Analysis 


We 
performed 
multivariate 
analyses 
of 
covariance 
(MANCO-
VAs) 
with 
gender 
as 
a 
between-subjects 
factor 
and 
grade 
as 
a 
covariate 
to 
assess 
the 
effects 
of 
gender 
and 
grade 
on 
sleep 
patterns 
for 
the 
US 
and 
Chinese 
children, 
respectively. 
We 
conducted 
MANCOVAs 
with 
nationality 
and 
gender 
as 
between-subjects 
factors 
and 
age 
as 
covariate 
for 
pooled 
children 
in 
grades 
1 
to 
4. 
Multivariate 
logistic 
regression 
analyses 
were 
conducted 
to 
examine 
the 
differences 
in 
frequencies 
of 
sleep 
problems 
between 
the 
2 
groups 
of 
children 
after 
adjustment 
for 
the 
effects 
of 
age 
and 
gender. 
Odds 
ratios 
and 
95% 
confidence 
intervals 
(CIs) 
were 
reported 
to 
show 
the 
differences. 
Finally, 
stepwise 
regression 
analyses 
were 
performed 
to 
examine 
the 
sleep 
problems 
that 
could 
predict 
sleep 
duration 
and 
the 
association 
between 
sleep 
duration 
and 
sleep 
problems 
that 
could 
predict 
daytime 
sleepiness 
for 
the 
US 
and 
Chinese 
children, 
respectively. 
Standardized 
regression 
coefficients 
were 
reported 
to 
present 
the 
effect 
size 
of 
each 
significant 
predictor. 


All 
analyses 
were 
performed 
by 
using 
the 
Statistical 
Program 
for 
Social 
Sciences 
(SPSS) 
for 
Windows, 
version 
11.5. 
All 
statistical 
significance 
was 
set 
at 
P 
.05. 


RESULTS 


Sleep/Wake 
Patterns 


For 
the 
US 
children, 
mean 
night 
bedtime 
was 
8:27 
pm 
(SD: 
30.6 
minutes), 
mean 
morning 
wakeup 
time 
was 
6:55

(SD: 
25.8 
minutes), 
and 
mean 
sleep 
duration 
was 
10.64 
hours 
(SD: 
0.67). 
Although 
boys 
went 
to 
bed 
later 
and 
woke 
up 
earlier 
than 
girls, 
multivariate 
analysis 
of 
variance 
did 
not 
show 
significant 
differences 
in 
bedtime 
and 
wake-up 
time 
between 
genders 
(P

Girls 
slept 
significantly

CSHQ 
scale 
scores 
were 
higher 
in 
Chinese

than 
in 
the 
US 
children, 
indicating 
that 
Chinese 
children 
were 
more 
likely 
to 
have 
parent-reported 
sleep

MANCOVA 
indicated 
that, 
with 
the

There 
were 
no 
sleep 
problems 
that 
happened 
in 
5% 
of 
the 
Chinese 
children. 


A 
series 
of 
multivariate 
logistic 
regression 
analyses 
were 
conducted 
to 
examine 
the 
differences 
in 
frequencies 
of 
sleep 
problems 
between 
the 
2 
groups 
of 
children, 
adjusting 
for 
the 
effects 
of 
age 
and 
gender. 
In 
the 
logistic 
regression 
model, 
the 
dependent 
variable 
was 
defined 
as 
1 
if 
the 
item 
rated 
as 
“sometimes” 
or 
“usually” 
and 
0 
if 
rated 
as 
“no” 
or 
“rarely.” 
As 
shown 
in 
Table

most 
sleep 
problems 
were 
more 
prevalent 
in 
Chinese 
children 
than 
in

A 
total 
of 
13

were 
commonly 
reported 
for 
both 
groups 
of 
children 
but 
did 
not

and 
all 
items 
regarding 
daytime 
sleepiness. 


Associations 
of 
Sleep 
Problems 
With 
Sleep 
Duration 


Stepwise 
linear 
regression 
analyses 
were 
conducted 
to 
examine 
the 
associations 
of 
individual 
sleep 
problems 
with 
sleep 
duration 
for 
the 
US 
and 
Chinese 
children, 
separately. 
In 
the 
regression 
analysis, 
items 
regarding 
daytime 
sleepiness 
were 
not 
selected 
as 
predicting 
variables, 
because 
we 
hypothesized 
that 
sleep 
duration 
could 
predict 
daytime 
sleepiness 
as 
described 
below. 
All 
variables 
in 
Table 
3 
were 
entered 
for 
stepwise 
regression 
analysis. 
As 
indicated 
in 
Table 
3, 
4 
sleep 
problems 
in 
the 
final 
model 
predicted 
sleep 
duration 
for 
the 
US 
children: 
difficulty 
falling 
asleep 
in 
20 
minutes 
(. 
0.209); 
struggling 
at 
bedtime 
(. 
0.254); 
trouble 
sleeping 
away 
(. 
0.117); 
and 
bedwetting 
(. 
0.149). 
The 
4 
sleep 
problems 
accounted 
for 
15.6% 
of 
variance 
of 
sleep 
duration. 
Bedwetting 
was 
associated 
with 
increased 
sleep 
duration, 
but 
3 
other 
sleep 
problems 
were 
associated 
with 
decreased 
sleep 
duration. 
For 
Chinese 
children, 
only 
2 
sleep 
problems 
remained 
significant 
in 
the 
final 
model: 
going 
to 
bed 
at 
different 
times 
(. 
0.213) 
and 
being 
afraid 
of 
sleeping 
alone 
(. 
0.146), 
accounting 
for 
7.2% 
variance 
of 
sleep 
duration. 


Association 
of 
Daytime 
Sleepiness 
With 
Sleep 
Duration 
and 
Sleep 
Problems 


Daytime 
sleepiness 
was 
very 
prevalent 
in 
both 
US 
and 
Chinese 
children. 
Stepwise 
regression 
analyses 
were 
performed 
to 
examine 
the 
association 
between 
sleep 
duration 
and 
sleep 
problems 
and 
daytime 
sleepiness 
for 
the 
US 
and 
Chinese 
children, 
with 
the 
CSHQ 
daytime-sleepiness 
scale 
score 
as 
the 
dependent 
variable. 
Table 
4 
presents 
all 
variables 
that 
were 
entered 
initially 
for 
stepwise 
regression 
and 
standardized 
regression 
coefficients 
for 
those 
variables 
that 
remained 
significant 
in 
the 
final 
model. 


For 
the 
US 
children, 
4 
sleep 
problems 
significantly 
predicted 
daytime 
sleepiness 
in 
the 
final 
model: 
difficulty 
falling 
asleep 
in 
20 
minutes 
(. 
0.138), 
being 
afraid 
of 
sleeping 
in 
the 
dark 
(. 
0.130), 
snoring 
(. 
0.178), 
and 
restless 
sleep 
(. 
0.193), 
accounting 
for 
12.1% 
variance. 
All 
4 
sleep 
problems 
were 
associated 
with 
increased 
likelihood 
for 
daytime 
sleepiness. 
Sleep 
duration 
was 
not 
a 
predictor. 
For 
Chinese 
children, 
sleep 
duration 
(. 
0.205) 
and 
5 
sleep 
problems 
were 
significant 
predictors 
of 
daytime 
sleepiness, 
accounting 
for 
21.5% 
variance. 
The 
5 
sleep 
problems 
were: 
needing 
a 
parent 
in 
the 
room 
to 
sleep 
(. 
0.145); 
snorting 
and 
gasping 
(. 
0.133); 
restless 
sleep 
(. 
0.125); 
teeth 
grinding 
(. 
0.148); 
and 
awakening 
screaming 
(. 
0.166). 
As 
expected, 
sleep 
duration 
was 
negatively 
associated 
with 
daytime 
sleepiness, 
and 
the 
5 
sleep 
problems 
were 
positively 
related 
to 
daytime 
sleepiness.

were 
reported 
by 
parents 
using 
the 
same 
well-established 
instrument, 
the 
CSHQ.31 
The 
main 
findings 
of 
this 
study 
can 
be 
summarized 
as 
follows: 
(1) 
for 
all 
children 
in 
the 
United 
States 
and 
China, 
bedtime 
was 
increasingly 
delayed 
and 
sleep 
duration 
decreased 
with 
increasing 
age; 
(2) 
compared 
with 
the 
same-
aged 
US 
children, 
Chinese 
children 
went 
to 
bed 
half 
an 
hour 
later, 
woke 
up 
half 
an 
hour 
earlier, 
and 
slept 
1 
hour 
less; 
(3) 
Chinese 
children 
were 
rated 
significantly 
higher 
than 
the 
US 
children 
on 
almost 
all 
CSHQ 
scales; 
(4) 
difficulty 
falling 
asleep, 
being 
afraid 
of 
sleeping 
in 
the 
dark, 
sleep 
talking, 
restless 
sleep, 
and 
teeth 
grinding 
during 
sleep 
and 
daytime 
sleepiness 
were 
common 
sleep 
problems 
for 
both 
groups 
of 
children, 
although 
most 
sleep 
problems 
were 
more 
frequent 
in 
Chinese 
children 
than 
in 
the 
US 
children; 
(5) 
there 
was 
a 
relationship 
between 
shorter 
sleep 
duration 
and 
difficulty 
falling 
asleep, 
struggling 
at 
bedtime, 
and 
trouble 
sleeping 
away 
from 
home 
for 
the 
US 
children, 
whereas 
going 
to 
bed 
at 
different 
times 
and 
having 
a 
fear 
of 
sleeping 
alone 
were 
related 
to 
shorter 
sleep 
duration 
in 
the 
Chinese 
sample; 
and 
(6) 
short 
sleep 
duration 
was 
a 
main 
predictor 
of 
daytime 
sleepiness 
for 
Chinese 
children, 
whereas 
restless 
sleep 
and 
snoring 
during 
sleep 
were 
main 
predictors 
for 
the 
US 
children. 


In 
the 
current 
study, 
we 
found 
that 
sleep 
patterns 
in 
Chinese 
children 
were 
significantly 
different 
from 
the 
US 
children, 
including 
later 
bedtime, 
earlier 
morning 
wake 
time, 
and 
shorter 
sleep 
duration 
by 
1 
hour. 
The 
difference 
in 
sleep 
patterns 
in 
children 
between 
the 
2 
countries 
may 
be 
attributed 
to 
different 
school 
schedules 
and 
homework 
load 
and 
sleep 
practices 
of 
the 
2 
countries. 
First, 
school 
started 
at 


7:30 
am 
in 
the 
sampled 
school 
district 
of 
China, 
1 
hour 
and 
20 
minutes 
earlier 
than 
the 
sampled 
school 
district 
of 
the 
United 
States 
(8:50 
am). 
The 
earlier 
school 
start 
time 
necessitates 
the 
Chinese 
children 
to 
get 
up 
earlier 
for 
the 
morning 
class. 
Second, 
it 
is 
well 
known 
that 
school 
children 
in 
China 
have 
more 
homework 
than 
most 
Western 
countries 
because 
of 
the 
high 
academic 
expectations 
of 
their 
parents 
and 
schools.25,26 
Most 
children 
in 
China 
have 
to 
do 
homework 
after 
dinner 
for 
1 
or 
2 
hours 
depending 
on 
the 
amount 
of 
homework, 
whereas 
the 
usual 
homework 
load 
for 
the 
US 
children 
was 
not 
30 
minutes. 
Third, 
in 
the 
Chinese 
sample, 
48% 
of 
children 
routinely 
shared 
a 
bed 
(26.4%) 
or 
room 
(21.6%) 
with 
their 
parents. 
Room 
sharing 
or 
bed 
sharing 
with 
parents 
may 
also 
contribute 
to 
later 
bedtimes 
and 
earlier 
morning 
wakeup 
times 
in 
Chinese 
children, 
because 
children’s 
sleep 
patterns 
are 
more 
likely 
to 
be 
influenced 
by 
the 
sleep 
patterns 
of 
cosleeping 
parents. 


It 
is 
important 
to 
note 
that 
Chinese 
children 
slept 
1 
hour 
less 
than 
the 
US 
children 
according 
to 
parent 
report. 
There 
are 
several 
potential 
explanations 
for 
the 
difference. 
First, 
Chinese 
children 
went 
to 
bed 
later 
and 
woke 
up 
earlier 
as 
described 
above. 
This 
is 
the 
most 
likely 
possibility 
to 
explain 
why 
Chinese 
children 
slept 
less. 
Second, 
Chinese 
parents 
may 
use 
night-sleep 
duration 
instead 
of 
total 
daily 
sleep 
duration, 
ignoring 
naptime. 
Napping 
is 
a 
well-accepted 
sleep 
habit 
in 
China. 
Most 
schools 
schedule 
lunch 
breaks 
of 
2 
hours, 
which 
allows 
students 
to 
have 
a 
brief 
nap 
of 
30 
minutes 
in 
winter 
and 
spring, 
and 
1 
hour 
in 
summer 
and 
fall. 
Thus, 
to 
some 
extent, 
the 
nap 
may 
explain 
the 
difference 
in 
sleep 
duration 
between 
the 
US 
and 
Chinese 
children. 
Unfortunately, 
in 
this 
study 
we 
did 
not 
collect 
specific 
data 
regarding 
naps. 
Alternatively, 
shorter 
sleep 
duration 
in 
Chinese 
children 
may 
be 
explained 
by 
sleep 
problems, 
because 
most 
sleep 
problems 
were 
more 
prev-

alent 
in 
Chinese 
children. 
However, 
stepwise 
regression 
analysis 
revealed 
only 
2 
sleep 
problems 
that 
were 
significantly 
associated 
with 
sleep 
duration 
and 
accounted 
for 
only 
7% 
variance. 
Another 
possibility 
is 
that 
Chinese 
children 
require 
less 
sleep 
than 
the 
US 
children. 
This 
can 
be 
interpreted 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
daytime 
sleepiness 
did 
not 
differ 
between 
the 
US 
and 
Chinese 
children. 
It 
is 
also 
possible 
that 
the 
difference 
in 
sleep 
duration 
between 
the 
2 
groups 
of 
children 
may 
be 
caused 
by 
parental 
overestimation 
of 
sleep 
duration 
for 
the 
US 
children 
and/or 
underestimation 
of 
sleep 
duration 
for 
Chinese 
children 
(ie, 
reporting 
bias). 
The 
US 
parents 
may 
know 
less 
about 
their 
child’s 
real 
sleep 
than 
Chinese 
parents 
because 
of 
the 
high 
frequency 
of 
room 
sharing 
or 
bed 
sharing 
with 
parents 
in 
Chinese 
children. 
The 
US 
parents 
may 
overestimate 
their 
child’s 
sleep 
duration 
using 
bedtime 
instead 
of 
the 
time 
of 
actual 
sleep 
onset, 
which 
may 
be 
significantly 
later 
than 
bedtime 
because 
of 
difficulty 
falling 
asleep 
and 
other 
bedtime-
resistance 
problems.6 
Finally, 
although 
we 
did 
not 
collect 
specific 
information 
regarding 
differences 
in 
weekend 
(non–school 
days) 
bedtimes 
and 
wake 
times, 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
the 
Chinese 
children 
attempt 
to 
“make 
up” 
for 
relatively 
less 
sleep 
during 
the 
week 
by 
increasing 
sleep 
duration 
on 
the 
weekends. 


Most 
sleep 
problems 
were 
more 
frequent 
in 
Chinese 
children 
than 
in 
the 
US 
children, 
although 
difficulty 
falling 
asleep, 
being 
afraid 
of 
sleeping 
in 
the 
dark, 
sleep 
talking, 
restless 
sleep, 
teeth 
grinding 
during 
sleep, 
and 
daytime 
sleepiness 
were 
very 
common 
for 
both 
groups 
of 
children. 
Cultural 
characteristics 
of 
sleep 
practices 
and 
environment 
may 
contribute 
to 
more 
sleep 
problems 
in 
Chinese 
children, 
such 
as 
cosleeping, 
being 
an 
only 
child 
in 
the 
family, 
crowded 
housing, 
and 
chronic 
stress 
caused 
by 
homework 
overload. 
For 
example, 
crowded 
housing 
in 
urban 
residents 
of 
China 
is 
very 
common, 
and 
many 
families 
with 
young 
children 
may 
have 
only 
1 
bedroom. 
In 
this 
sample, 
60% 
of 
families 
owned 
a 
living 
space 
20 
m2 
per 
person 
and 
35% 
owned 
a 
living 
space 
15 
m2. 
Crowded 
housing 
limits 
children 
having 
their 
own 
room 
and 
even 
a 
separate 
bed 
at 
home, 
and 
parents 
have 
to 
bed 
share 
with 
their 
children. 
There 
is 
evidence 
that 
crowded 
housing 
and 
bed 
sharing 
affect 
children’s 
sleep 
quality 
and 
quantity,18,22 
which 
may 
explain 
why 
Chinese 
children 
are 
more 
likely 
to 
go 
to 
bed 
at 
different 
times, 
wake 
in 
the 
night, 
and 
sleep 
different 
amounts 
each 
day. 
Another 
potential 
factor 
that 
may 
contribute 
to 
higher 
rates 
of 
sleep 
problems 
among 
Chinese 
children 
should 
not 
be 
ignored: 
being 
the 
only 
child 
in 
the 
family 
because 
of 
the 
family-planning 
policy. 
An 
only 
child 
is 
frequently 
regarded 
as 
“a 
little 
emperor” 
or 
“a 
little 
sun,” 
namely 
a 
spoiled/overprotected 
child. 
Only 
children 
in 
China 
are 
described 
as 
overdependent, 
egocentric, 
less 
cooperative, 
timid, 
and 
unadjusted.30 
These 
characteristics 
may 
increase 
the 
likelihood 
of 
children 
bed 
sharing 
with 
parents 
and 
sleep-resistance 
problems 
such 
as 
needing 
a 
parent 
in 
the 
room 
to 
sleep 
and 
being 
afraid 
of 
sleeping 
alone. 
Another 
explanation 
for 
the 
difference 
is 
that 
Chinese 
children 
are 
more 
likely 
to 
develop 
sleep 
problems 
because 
of 
genetic 
effects. 
However, 
to 


date 
there 
has 
been 
no 
evidence 
to 
indicate 
that 
specific 
genes 
are 
linked 
to 
ethnic 
differences 
in 
sleep 
patterns 
and 
sleep 
problems. 
It 
is 
also 
possible 
that 
the 
difference 
is 
caused 
by 
information 
bias. 
The 
US 
parents 
may 
underestimate 
their 
child’s 
sleep 
problems 
because 
the 
US 
parents 
and 
their 
children 
slept 
in 
separate 
rooms 
and 
subsequently 
know 
less 
about 
their 
children’s 
sleep 
problems, 
which 
may 
be 
why 
some 
parasomnia 
and 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
behaviors 
were 
less 
likely 
to 
be 
reported 
by 
the 
US 
parents. 


Daytime 
sleepiness 
was 
very 
common 
for 
both 
groups 
of 
children. 
Approximately 
60% 
of 
children 
needed 
to 
be 
awakened 
by 
parents 
in 
the 
morning 
at 
least 
2 
to 
4 
times 
a 
week, 
40% 
had 
a 
hard 
time 
getting 
out 
of 
bed 
in 
the 
morning, 
30% 
woke 
up 
in 
a 
bad 
mood, 
26% 
to 
36% 
fell 
asleep 
while 
riding 
in 
a 
car, 
23% 
took 
a 
long 
time 
to 
be 
alert, 
22% 
seemed 
tired 
during 
the 
day, 
and 
10% 
fell 
asleep 
while 
watching 
television. 
To 
compare 
sleep 
predictors 
of 
daytime 
sleepiness 
between 
the 
US 
and 
Chinese 
children, 
stepwise 
regression 
analyses 
were 
conducted 
separately 
for 
both 
groups 
of 
children. 
It 
is 
interesting 
to 
note 
that 
short 
sleep 
duration 
was 
a 
main 
determinant 
of 
daytime 
sleepiness 
for 
Chinese 
children 
but 
not 
for 
the 
US 
children. 
Other 
important 
determinants 
for 
daytime 
sleepiness 
in 
Chinese 
children 
were 
episodic 
nocturnal 
behaviors 
such 
as 
teeth 
grinding 
and 
awakening 
screaming 
(possible 
night 
terrors). 
Daytime 
sleepiness 
in 
the 
US 
children 
was 
related 
to 
restless 
sleep, 
snoring, 
sleep-onset 
delay, 
and 
being 
afraid 
of 
sleeping 
in 
the 
dark, 
which 
all 
together 
accounted 
for 
a 
small 
variance 
(12%). 
This 
finding 
has 
important 
implications 
for 
effective 
assessment 
of 
and 
intervention 
for 
daytime 
sleepiness 
for 
the 
US 
and 
Chinese 
children, 
respectively. 
For 
the 
US 
children, 
screening 
and 
intervention 
should 
be 
focused 
on 
treatment 
of 
nighttime 
sleep 
problems, 
but 
for 
Chinese 
children, 
assessment 
and 
intervention 
should 
be 
focused 
on 
lengthening 
night-sleep 
duration 
either 
through 
advancing 
bedtime 
or 
delaying 
wake 
time 
(eg, 
school 
start 
times). 


The 
main 
limitation 
of 
this 
study 
is 
that 
children’s 
sleep 
was 
assessed 
by 
reports 
from 
parents 
rather 
than 
objective 
instruments, 
and 
parents 
were 
the 
only 
informants 
of 
children’s 
sleep 
patterns 
and 
sleep 
problems. 
The 
differences 
in 
sleep 
patterns 
and 
sleep 
problems 
may 
be 
caused 
by 
reporting 
bias 
as 
described 
above. 
Another 
limitation 
of 
the 
comparative 
study 
is 
that 
we 
are 
not 
sure 
if 
the 
differences 
in 
sleep 
patterns 
and 
sleep 
problems 
can 
be 
generalized 
to 
all 
children 
in 
the 
United 
States 
and 
China, 
because 
only 
3 
schools 
were 
sampled 
from 
1 
school 
district 
in 
Jinan 
of 
China 
and 
southeastern 
New 
England 
of 
the 
United 
States. 
Furthermore, 
it 
should 
be 
noted 
that 
response 
rates 
differed 
greatly 
between 
the 
US 
and 
Chinese 
samples 
(47% 
vs 
92%). 
It 
is 
unclear 
whether 
and 
to 
what 
extent 
the 
comparison 
of 
children’s 
sleep 
could 
be 
affected 
by 
the 
difference 
in 
response 
rates 
of 
the 
2 
samples. 


Four 
future 
directions 
for 
cross-cultural 
study 
of 
children’s 
sleep 
patterns 
and 
sleep 
problems 
are 
suggested 
by 
the 
results 
of 
this 
study. 
Additional 
research 
is 
needed 
to 
investigate 
what 
cultural 
factors

PATTERNS

(child-rearing 
beliefs, 
attitudes, 
and 
practices) 
contribute 
to 
sleep 
practices 
and 
sleep 
problems 
among 
children 
of 
different 
ethnic 
and 
racial 
groups. 
Multiple 
informants 
(including 
teachers 
and 
self-report) 
as 
well 
as 
more 
objective 
methodologies 
such 
as 
actigraphy 
are 
needed 
to 
assess 
children’s 
sleep 
in 
future 
comparative 
studies 
to 
reduce 
information 
bias. 
Third, 
prospective 
studies 
are 
needed 
to 
understand 
how 
sleep 
patterns 
and 
sleep 
problems 
in 
different 
cultural 
contexts 
exert 
effects 
on 
cognitive, 
behavioral, 
emotional, 
and 
physical 
development 
of 
children. 
Finally, 
our 
study 
showed 
that 
children’s 
sleep 
duration 
differed 
between 
the 
United 
States 
and 
China. 
Large-scale 
epidemiologic 
studies 
with 
objective 
measures 
are 
needed 
to 
confirm 
this 
finding. 
If 
this 
conclusion 
is 
confirmed, 
additional 
studies 
are 
needed 
to 
investigate 
the 
effects 
of 
different 
sleep 
duration 
on 
children’s 
development 
under 
different 
cultural 
contexts, 
and 
the 
optimal 
sleep 
duration 
for 
children 
from 
different 
cultural 
backgrounds 
should 
be 
recommended 
accordingly.
