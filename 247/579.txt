Abstract 

Objectie: In this study, we would like to show that anterior rhinometry measurement of nasal resistance would be 
a simple and useful test to identify severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in a population of children affected by 
adenotonsillar hypertrophy. Methods: Seventy-three consecutive children (44 males; mean age 5.41.2 years) with 
adenotonsillar hypertrophy, who complained sleep-disordered breathing, were studied. All the parents completed a 
questionnaire concerning the children’s sleeping habits and sleep complaints before consultation; each child underwent 
a general paediatric examination and an evaluation of craniofacial features and upper airway patency. In all 73 
children polysomnography was performed and anterior rhinometry nasal patency was measured. Results: The 
diagnosis of OSA was confirmed in 44/73 patients (60%). Total nasal resistance showed a significant direct correlation 
with apnea hypopnea index, arousal index, snoring time, percentage of sleep time spent at SaO2 90% and a 
significant inverse correlation with total sleep time, sleep efficiency and the mean of SaO2% during sleep. Total nasal 
resistance was significantly related to snoring, mouth breathing and daytime sleepiness. The receiver operator 
characteristics (ROC) curve indicates that in the range of age of our sample a nasal resistance value of 0.59 Pa/cm3/s 
has a sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 96% for identifying the children with adenotonsillar hypertrophy affected 
by OSA. Conclusions: Our study shows that in children with adenotonsillar hypertrophy nasal resistance seems to be 
risk factor for OSA. The anterior rhinometry appears as a useful tool in routine evaluation of sleep-disordered 
breathing in these patients. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

per airway obstruction during sleep, and is associated 
with snoring, apneic episodes, restless sleep, 
hypoxemia, growth failure, daytime hypersomnolence, 
behavioural problems and cor pulmonale 
[1,2]. Marcus et al. [3] have recently shown that 
children with moderate OSA have higher diastolic 
blood pressure than controls and it is possible 
that they will develop worsening hypertension 
over the years unless they receive treatment. 

OSA affects 1–3% of the pre-school population 
[4,5]. It is usually provoked by adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy and can be treated efficiently by 
adenotonsillectomy. 

The number of subjects with suspected OSA 
referred to sleep laboratories is increasing and it 
is difficult to manage a waiting list properly because 
some patients may have severe OSA and 
others a mild disorder. As in the case of adults, a 
procedure for establishing priority in paediatric 
patients with severe OSA would be useful in 
managing the waiting list and promptly planning 
confirmatory polysomnography (PSG) and surgical 
procedures. 

We hypothesised that the rhinometry measurement 
of nasal resistances would be a simple and 
useful test that could help identify children with 
severe OSA. 

2. Methods 
2.1. Patients 
The study involved 73 consecutive children 
with a mean age of 5.41.2 years (range 4–7), 
who were referred for sleep study by paediatricians 
or otolaryngologists because of a history of 
snoring and/or difficulty in breathing during 
sleep. The exclusion criteria were acute adenotonsillitis, 
tonsillectomy, rhinitis, asthma, neuromuscular 
disease and craniofacial abnormalities: all of 
the children had enlarged adenoids and tonsils 
confirmed by clinical examination and endoscopy. 

Informed consent was obtained from parents or 
legal guardians, and the study was approved by 
the hospital Ethics Committee. 

2.2. Clinical ealuation 
The parents completed a questionnaire concerning 
the children’s sleeping habits and sleep 
complaints before consultation, including questions 
about snoring (more than 2–3 times a 
week), observed apnea, mouth breathing and daytime 
sleepiness (sometimes or often falling asleep 
watching television). All of the questions required 
yes or no answers and the questionnaire usually 
took about 5 min to complete. The answers were 
reviewed with the parents and the child during 
the clinical interview. 

Each child underwent a general paediatric examination 
and an evaluation of craniofacial features 
and upper airway patency. Tonsillar size 
was evaluated according to a previously published 
scale [6]: all of the children were classified as 
grade 2 (enlarged beyond the pillars, but not 
meeting the uvula) or grade 3 (meeting the uvula). 

2.3. Single nostril anterior rhinometry 
Nasal patency was measured by means of single 
nostril anterior rhinometry [7] using a transparent 
plastic oronasal mask with an inflatable cuff. A 
pressure catheter was attached to the nostrils with 
adhesive tape in order to provide an airtight seal 
with minimal distortion of the nostrils. Nasopharyngeal 
pressure and airflow velocity were measured 
using a linear pneumotachograph and 
plotted on a X–Y recorder (Rhinotest MP 500, 
Allergopharma J. Ganzer KG Reinbek, Hamburg, 
Germany). Nasal resistance was calculated 
at standard pressure (150 Pa) and expressed as 
centimetres of H2O per litre per second. Airflow 
velocity (ml/s) was measured at a pressure differential 
of -1.5 cm H2O. The device was calibrated 
before use by means of a standard resistor 
at a reading of 250 ml/s. The measurements were 
made with the patient in an erect position, the 
readings being made first in the right nostril and 
then in the left [8]. Right and left resistances and 
airflow were recorded, and total resistance was 
calculated using the formula (R×L)/(R+L), 
where R and L were the resistances of the right 
and left nostril. A minimum of three readings 
with a variability of less than 5% were made in

order to obtain a final average. Rhinometry was 
performed before PSG. 

2.4. Sleep studies 
All of the 73 children underwent PSG, a noninvasive, 
objective and accepted test for assessing 
OSA (Alice 3 Healthdyne, Marietta, OH, USA), 
without any sleep deprivation or sedation. 
Overnight sleep studies were performed using 
standard polysomnographic techniques, including 
recordings of an electroencephalogram (EEG) 
(C4/A2,C3/A1), electrooculogram (EOG), sub-
mental electromyogram (EMG) and electrocardiogram 
(ECG) with surface electrodes. Airflow 
and ventilatory efforts were, respectively 
recorded by means of naso-oral thermocouples 
and piezoelectrodes; oxygen saturation (SaO2) 
was monitored using a finger oximeter (Pulsox 7, 
Minolta, Osaka, Japan). The transducers and 
lead wires allowed normal positional changes 
during sleep. Snoring sounds were recorded by 
means of an air-coupled subminiature microphone 
(sensitivity threshold 20 dB UIL at 125 
Hz), both taped to the skin at the level of the 
larynx. 

Quiet breathing was recorded at a level of less 
than 50 dB; any deflections synchronous with 
respiration in the microphone channel and exceeding 
50 dB were counted as snores, and the 
percentage of total sleep time (TST) spent in 
snoring was calculated. 

Bedtime and waking time were left to each 
subject’s discretion, with PSG being terminated 
after final awakening. In order to avoid the first 
night effect, each subject slept two nights in the 
sleep laboratory and only the sleep parameters 
recorded during the second night were evaluated. 
Each signal was acquired on an optical disk and 
manually scored in 30-s epochs to identify 
pathological respiration during sleep, according 
to the recommendations of the ATS [9]. 

Sleep stages and architecture were analysed 
according to standard criteria [10], with microarousals 
being scored as defined by the 
ASDA [11]. The collection of transient arousals 

allowed the calculation of the arousal index 
(number of arousals per hour of sleep). 

TST and sleep stages were evaluated according 
to the ATS recommendations [9]; sleep efficiency 
was defined as the ratio between TST and 
the total time in bed. 

In accordance with the ATS criteria, apnea 
was classified as obstructive (cessation of airflow 
of any duration with the presence of chest wall 
motion), central (a period without airflow and 
respiratory efforts) and mixed (with the characteristics 
of both). 

Hypopnea was defined as a decrease in airflow 
of at least half in comparison with previous values, 
associated with a simultaneous drop in 
SaO2 of 4% or more in comparison with the 
previous recorded data. 

The apnea hypopnea index (AHI) was the 
number of hypopneas, obstructive and mixed 
apneas per hour of sleep [9]. 

Using the nocturnal tracing, the mean values 
of each epoch and SaO2, and the percentage of 
sleep time spent at SaO2 90% (CT 90) were 
calculated. 

The diagnosis of OSA required an AHI of 1 
or more per hour of sleep. 

2.5 Statistical analysis 
The clinical data and PSG variables are expressed 
as mean valuesSD. 

The correlation between nasal resistance and 
the parameters monitored during PSG were evaluated 
using Spearman’s correlation test; logistic 
regression was used to evaluate the relationship 
between clinical symptoms and total nasal 
resistance. 

Standard techniques were used to obtain Receiver 
Operator Characteristics (ROC) curves. 
Assuming nasal resistance as a reference value 
for the severity of OSA, we calculated the specificity, 
sensitivity, and positive and negative predictive 
values of rhinometry. 

A P value of 0.05 was considered statistically 
significant; all of the statistical calculations 
were made using the SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, 
IL, USA)

3. Results 
We studied 73 consecutive patients (59% males; 
mean age 5.41.2, years: range 4–7) referred for 
suspected OSA; their mean weight and height was 
19.12.1 kg (range 16–23) and 1083cm 
(range 102–112). The parents reported habitual 
snoring in 55 cases (78%, without any gender 
differences), witnessed apneic episodes in 37 
(53%), oral breathing in 46 (66%) and daytime 
sleepiness in 18 (26%). 

The diagnosis of OSA was confirmed in 44/73 
patients (60%). The mean AHI in the population 
as a whole was 109 and the same value was 
observed for the arousal index. TST was 43135 
min and sleep efficiency 925% the distribution 
of sleep stages as percentages of TST was REM 
124%, S1+S2 543% and S3+S4 263%, 
and the snoring time was 2623%. 

Mean nocturnal SaO2 was 923%, CT9O 
4.03% of TST, and the mean total nasal resistance 
was 0.920.8 Pa/cm3/s. 

The correlation between nasal resistance and 
AHI and the arousal index was similar (r=0.83 
and 0.81; P0.0001) (Figs. 1 and 2). Snoring 
time (r=0.85), CT9O (r=0.65), TST (r=- 
0.75), sleep efficiency (r=-0.65) and SaO2 (r= 
-0.78) were significantly correlated (P0.000l) 
with nasal resistance (Table 1).

The logistic regression data are shown in Table 

2. There was a significant correlation (P0.005) 
between total nasal resistance and snoring, oral 
breathing and daytime sleepiness, but no significant 
correlation with witnessed apnea. 
The ROC curve of nasal resistance is shown in 
Fig. 3, without a specific cut-off point; the ability 
to identify patients with OSA is greatly affected 
by varying the threshold value along the curve. A 
value of 0.59 Pa/cm3/s had a sensitivity of 0.91% 
(true positive ratio), a specificity of 0.96% (true 
negative ratio), a positive predictive value (PPV) 
of 97%, and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 
86%.

4. Discussion 
The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
usefulness of nasal resistance measurements in 
identifying children with clinically severe OSA in 
order to allow prompt diagnostic PSG, because 
the number of patients sent to sleep laboratories is 
continually increasing and the waiting lists may 
extend for months. 

As in the case of adults, PSG is being increasingly 
requested for children, some of whom have 
severe symptoms and others less severe complaints. 
Using an AHI5 events/h of sleep, the 
prevalence of OSA in the pediatric population 
ranges from 15 to 51% [6,12]; when a less selective 
AHl cut-off of 1 event/h of sleep plus low 
saturation levels is used, Sivan et al. [13], Marcus 
et al. [3] and our own study found 62, 61 and 60% 
of OSA-positive patients. These data clearly indicate 
that, in many sleep laboratories, about 40% 
of the patients tested have no OSA risk and could 
be examined later.

children with OSA. 


A large number of adult surveys have been 
conducted in order to establish the presence or 
absence of OSA by means of parameters such as 
age, sex, snoring, witnessed apnea and daytime 
sleepiness, and giving a score for each clinical 
feature suggestive of sleep apnea. 

An AHl cut-off value of 10/h of sleep [14,15] 
has been found to have a sensitivity of 74–78% 
and a specificity of between 93 and 67%, whereas 
the sensitivity and specificity of an AHI15 
were, respectively 92 and 51% [16]. 

Many ‘sleep disorder questionnaires’ (SDQs) 
have been tested with conflicting results: some 
authors [17] have found 85% sensitivity and 76% 
specificity, but others [18] have found less interesting 
results (45% sensitivity and 41% specificity) 
and excluded the clinical usefulness of this approach. 
A similar conclusion was also reached by 
another study [19]. 

Attempts to predict OSA before PSG have led 
to similarly conflicting results in children. One 
study [20] has shown that an OSA-positive nap 
correlates well with noctumal PSG results (a sensitivity 
and specificity of, respectively 74 and 
100%, a PPV of 100% and an NPV of 17%), and 
another study [21] has found that some nap 
parameters have good specificity but only moderate 
sensitivity. 

Brouillette et al. [22] suggest a score based on 
noctumal respiratory difficulties, apnea, snoring 
and the data obtained using a questionnaire: this 
system has a PPV of 92%, but it is not capable of 
distinguishing OSA from normal subjects or simple 
snorers [23]. In another study, Rosen et al. [24] 
concluded that a clinical evaluation of symptomatic 
children is not reliable for diagnosing or 
excluding OSA, and that even asymptomatic snorers 
require PSG. Finally, Carroll et al. [25] concluded 
that a medical history cannot distinguish 
primary snoring (PS) and OSA. 

Brouillette et al. [26] have recently used noctumal 
oxymetry in 485 children as a test for predicting 
OSA, and found a PPV of 97%: it is therefore 
capable of identifying the patients requiring diagnostic 
PSG, but a negative result is not sufficient 
to exclude OSA. 

Nasal resistances in adults do not correlate with 
the severity of respiratory disturbances during

sleep [27,28], nor do they represent a risk factor 
for causing or worsening OSA [29] or a diagnostic 
predictive factor [30]: however, they are a risk 
factor for snoring [31,32]. The nasal resistance in 
children significantly decreases with age and it is 
elevate in the presence of muconasal swelling, 
adenoid enlargement and other significant nasal 
pathology [33–36]. Kim et al. (1998) [37] concluded 
that the occurrence of upper airway obstruction 
is frequently seen in patients with 
adenotonsillar hypertrophy due to a congestion of 
the inferior turbinate, with a complete normalisation 
after adenoidectomy and tonsillectomy. 

Our case record shows that parental reports of 
snoring and oral breathing are the commonest 
symptoms, followed by daytime sleepiness; all 
three significantly correlated with nasal resistance. 
Previous studies [22–25] showed a little utility of 
this symptoms in predicting OSA. Moreover 
Parker et al. [33] demonstrated that the only 
presence of mouth-breathing and/or ‘adenoidal 
facies’ may depends not only from an increase in 
nasal resistances but also to other conditions such 
us alterations in mandibular posture. 

The children spent 26% of TST in snoring and 
their sleep architecture was roughly similar to the 
published data [38]. Nasal resistance significantly 
correlated with the PSG parameters: the increased 
lymphatic tissue and inflammation observed may 
lead to upper airway intraluminal collapse, thus 
promoting apnea, hypopnea and arousals. 

The ROC curve indicates that a nasal resistance 
value of 0.59 Pa/cm3/s has a sensitivity of 91%, a 
specificity of 96%, a PPV of 97% and an NPV of 
86%: these values are higher than those reported 
in published studies of the possibility of diagnosing 
OSA before PSG. Nasal resistances also offer 
better diagnostic opportunities than oxymetry and 
nap, and represent a more simple and objective 
system that saves technician time by avoiding the 
need to score and interpret the results of monitoring. 
In our study, only four patients with clinically 
significant disturbed breathing during sleep were 
missed using this approach (false negatives). 

It can be concluded that nasal resistances in the 
presence of local lymphoid tissue hypertrophy are 
a useful means of managing waiting lists: although 
the symptomatic patients with normal 

nasal resistance must obviously undergo PSG in 
any case, they can be examined at a later time. In 
the range of age of our sample we suggest to use 

0.59 Pa/cm3/s as threshold to identify the children 
with adenotonsillar hypertrophy affected by OSA.
