Study 
objectives: 
To 
estimate 
the 
prevalence 
of 
snoring, 
witnessed 
sleep 
apnea, 
teeth 
grinding, 
primary 
and 
secondary 
nocturnal 
enuresis, 
and 
sleep 
duration 
in 
Hong 
Kong 
primary 
school 
children. 
Design: 
Cross-sectional 
telephone 
questionnaire 
survey 
in 
a 
community. 
Participants: 
A 
total 
of 
3,047 
6-to 
12-year-old 
apparently 
healthy 
children. 
Intervention: 
Those 
who 
agreed 
to 
the 
study 
were 
contacted 
by 
telephone. 
Survey 
questions 
were 
asked 
about 
the 
symptoms 
of 
the 
different 
sleep 
disorders, 
and 
the 
frequency 
of 
each 
positive 
symptom 
was 
noted 
for 
the 
preceding 
1 
week. 
Outcome 
measures: 
Prevalence 
and 
risk 
factors 
of 
sleep 
disorders 
in 
Hong 
Kong 
primary 
school 
children. 
Results: 
The 
prevalence 
of 
the 
following 
sleep 
symptoms 
was 
listed 
as 
follows: 
habitual 
snoring 
(10.9%), 
witnessed 
sleep 
apnea 
(1.5%), 
nocturnal 
enuresis 
(5.1%), 
and 
sleep 
teeth 
grinding 
(20.5%). 
Significant 
risk 
factors 
for 
habitual 
snoring 
included 
witnessed 
sleep 
apnea, 
mouth 
breathing 
during 
sleep, 
snoring 
in 
first-degree 
relatives, 
headache 
on 
rising, 
male 
gender, 
allergic 
rhinitis, 
and 
sleep 
teeth 
grinding. 
Significant 
risk 
factors 
for 
witnessed 
sleep 
apnea 
included 
habitual 
snoring, 
allergic 
rhinitis, 
tiredness 
on 
rising, 
and 
excessive 
daytime 
sleepiness. 
Poor 
academic 
results 
were 
associated 
with 
present 
of 
witnessed 
sleep 
apnea 
and 
absence 
of 
sleep 
teeth 
grinding. 
None 
of 
the 
sleep 
problem 
was 
associated 
with 
poor 
conduct 
results. 
The 
mean 
sleep 
duration 
was 
8.79 
h 
(SD 
0.96). 
Conclusions: 
This 
study 
provides 
epidemiologic 
data 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing, 
enuresis, 
sleep 
teeth 
grinding, 
and 
duration 
of 
sleep 
in 
Chinese 
primary 
school 
children 
in 
Hong 
Kong.

by 
Liu 
et

who 
found 
sleep 
walking 
to 
be 
the 
most 
common 
sleep 
problem 
(14.2%). 
In 
the 
same 
study, 
excessive 
daytime 
sleepiness 
(EDS), 
ie, 
sleep 
in 
class, 
was 
found 
in 
9.4% 
and 
nocturnal 
enuresis 
(NE) 
was 
found 
in 
4.5%. 
The 
prevalence 
of 
snoring 
and 
witnessed 
sleep

was 
not 
addressed 
in 
that 
study. 
NE 
was 
found 
to 
occur 
in 
3.5%

We 
report 
here 
a 
community-based, 
structured 
telephone 
interview 
to 
estimate 
the 
prevalence 
of 
snoring, 
witnessed 
sleep 
apnea, 
teeth 
grinding, 
EDS, 
primary 
and 
secondary 
NE, 
and 
sleep 
duration 
in 
a 
group 
of 
randomly 
selected 
primary 
school 
Chinese 
students 
in 
Hong 
Kong. 


Materials 
and 
Methods 


Primary 
schools 
were 
randomly 
selected 
from 
each 
district 
of 
Hong 
Kong, 
namely 
Hong 
Kong 
Island, 
Kowloon, 
and 
New 
Territory, 
by 
assigning 
each 
primary 
school 
a 
unique 
number, 
and 
all 
number 
were 
entered 
into 
a 
statistical 
program 
(SPSS, 
Release 


10.1 
for 
Windows; 
SPSS; 
Chicago, 
IL) 
for 
random 
selection. 
The 
number 
of 
schools 
selected 
from 
each 
district 
was 
on 
a 
pro 
rata 
basis. 
Ten 
primary 
schools 
were 
included 
in 
this 
study. 
All 
included 
primary 
schools 
that 
admitted 
students 
of 
both 
genders, 
with 
ages 
ranging 
from 
5 
to 
16 
years. 
In 
this 
study, 
students 
aged 
6 
to 
12 
years 
were 
enrolled. 
The 
total 
population 
of 
the 
10 
schools 
was 
6,020 
students. 
The 
primary 
school 
population 
in 
Hong 
Kong 
at 
the 
time 
of 
survey 
was 
494,000. 
A 
letter 
(Appendix 
1) 
was 
sent 
to 
all 
parents 
explaining 
the 
purpose 
of 
the 
study 
and 
inviting 
them 
to 
join 
the 
study. 
Parents 
gave 
their 
consent 
by 
returning 
the 
consent 
form 
together 
with 
their 
telephone 
numbers. 
Within 
3 
to 
7 
months 
of 
receiving 
the 
consent 
forms, 
a 
modified 
version 
of 
Tucson 
Children’s 
Assessment 
of 
Sleep 
Apnea 
(TuCASA) 
screening 
questionnaire7 
(Appendix 
2) 
was 
administered 
by 
trained 
workers 
(J.M.C. 
and 
S.Y.L.) 
over 
the 
telephone 
during 
the 
weekdays. 
The 
language 
used 
for 
interview 
was 
Cantonese, 
which 
is 
the 
dialect 
of 
Hong 
Kong 
Chinese. 
More 
than 
95% 
of 
the 
citizens 
in 
Hong 
Kong 
can 
understand, 
listen, 
and 
speak 
Cantonese. 
English 
and 
Mandarin 
were 
used 
by 
the 
investigators 
if 
needed. 
Although 
this 
questionnaire 
was 
not 
previously 
validated, 
it 
was 
developed 
from 
the 
TuCASA 
screening 
questionnaire.
7 
The 
revision 
and 
Cantonese 
translation 
of 
the 
TuCASA 
screening 
questionnaire 
was 
based 
on 
the 
collective 
opinion 
of 
two 
pediatric 
pulmonologists 
(D.K.N. 
and 
K.L.K.). 
Parents 
who 
had 
impaired 
hearing 
or 
a 
speech 
impediment 
were 
excluded. 
The 
occurrence 
of 
symptoms 
of 
different 
sleep 
disorders 
was 
asked 
with 
the 
reference 
period 
being 
the 
preceding 
1 
week 
or 
1 
day, 
depending 
on 
the 
question. 
If 
the 
parents 
were 
not 
sure 
of 
the 
answers, 
they 
received 
an 
explanation 
of 
the 
different 
symptoms, 
and 
were 
contacted 
1 
week 
later. 


Habitual 
snoring 
was 
defined 
as 
snoring 
for 
6 
to 
7 
nights 
a 
week. 
EDS 
was 
defined 
as 
the 
coexistence 
of 
two 
or 
more 
daytime 
sleepiness 
symptoms 
(ie, 
falling 
asleep 
while 
watching 
television, 
falling 
asleep 
during 
a 
lesson, 
falling 
asleep 
while 
doing 
homework, 
and 
falling 
asleep 
in 
a 
vehicle). 
Primary 
NE 
was 
defined 
as 
nocturnal 
bed-wetting 
beyond 
the 
age 
of 
5 
years 
and 
never 
having 
a 
period 
of 
dryness. 
Secondary 
NE 
was 
defined 
as 
bed-wetting 
after 
a 
period 
of 
at 
least 
6 
months 
of 
dryness. 
Parents 
were 
asked 
about 
the 
overall 
examination 
and 
conduct 
results 
in 
the 
preceding 
school 
term. 
Academic 
results 
were 
ranked 
as 
good 
(grade 
A/B), 
fair 
(grade 
C/D), 
or 
poor 
(grade 
E). 
Conduct 
was 
graded 
by 
the 
class 
teacher 
in 
charge, 
with 
the 
scores 
from 
A 
to 


F. 
Those 
who 
scored 
E 
or 
F 
were 
classified 
as 
bad 
conduct. 
The 
protocol 
of 
this 
study 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
ethic 
committee 
of 
Kwong 
Wah 
Hospital. 
Statistical 
Analysis 


All 
analyses 
were 
done 
using 
statistical 
software 
(SPSS, 
Release 


10.1 
for 
Windows; 
SPSS; 
Chicago, 
IL). 
Distribution 
of 
data 
was 
assessed 
by 
one-sample 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov 
test. 
Comparisons 
of 
continuous 
variables 
were 
conducted 
with 
unpaired 
Student 
t 
test 
or 
one-way 
analysis 
of 
variance. 
A 
Pearson 
2 
test 
was 
used 
for 
categorical 
variables. 
Risk 
factors 
for 
snoring, 
witnessed 
sleep 
apnea, 
EDS, 
NE, 
poor 
academic 
results, 
and 
poor 
conduct 
were 
analyzed 
by 
logistic 
regression. 
Significant 
risk 
factors 
were 
defined 
as 
a 
Wald 
statistic 
gave 
a 
p 
value 
. 
0.05. 
The 
adjusted 
odds 
ratio 
(OR) 
of 
each 
significant 
factor 
was 
reported. 


Results 


All 
10 
schools 
contacted 
initially 
agreed 
to 
the 
study. 
A 
total 
of 
6,020 
invitation 
letters 
were 
sent 
to 
all 
eligible 
students 
in 
10 
schools, 
and 
there 
were 
4,432 
responses 
(73.6%). 
Of 
all 
4,432 
eligible 
students, 
3,139 
agreed 
(70.8%) 
to 
a 
phone 
interview 
and 
1,293 
refused 
(26.1%). 
Of 
the 
3,139 
students 
who 
agreed, 
92 
were 
excluded 
(2.93%) 
because 
they 
were 
. 
12 
years 
old. 
Therefore, 
3,047 
students 
were 
interviewed. 
The 
successful 
interview 
rate 
was 
68.8% 
(3,047 
of 
4,432 
students). 
Interviews 
were 
finished 
at 
the 
first 
successful 
contact 
in 
all 
cases, 
and 
no 
further 
contact 
was 
required. 
All 
interviews 
were 
completed 
in 
Cantonese. 
The 
mean 
age 
was 
8.90 
years 
(SD, 
1.72; 
range, 
6 
to 
12 
years) 
[Fig

The 
distribution 
of 
age 
was 
significantly 
deviated 
from

The 
male/female 
ratio 
was 
1.32:1. 
The 
gender 
distribution 
in 
the 
two 
age 
groups 
was 
similar 
(Table

There 
was 
significantly 
more

Discussion 


The 
modified

telephone 
questionnaire 
survey 
provided 
information 
about 
sleep-related 
symptoms 
in 
Hong 
Kong 
Chinese 
children. 
A 
structured 
telephone 
interview 
to 
probe 
for 
sleep 
problems 
in 
community-based 
sample 
was 
used 
previously 
in 
an 
adult 
population.9 
The 
main 
strength 
of 
the 
current 
study 
was 
the 
telephone 
interview 
that 
allowed 
explanation 
of 
symptoms, 
eg, 
sleep 
apnea, 
snoring, 
or 
NE. 
The 
accuracy 
of 
the 
data 
was 
further 
enhanced 
by 
allowing 
the 
parents 
to 
observe 
for 
1 
week 
before 
answering 
the 
questions.

previously:

12%

Unlike 
the 
previous 
report, 
the 
current 
study 
identified 
male 
gender 
to 
be 
a 
significant 
risk 
factor. 
This 
might 
be 
attributed 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
male 
Hong 
Kong 
children 
were 
more 
likely 
to 
have 
allergic 
rhinitis 
as 
shown 
in 
the 
current

Assuming

be 
similar 
to 
the

in 
the

This 
was 
similar 
to 
the 
findings 
by

Hence, 
it 
would 
not 
be 
surprising 
that 
treatment 
of 
allergic

helped 
control 
OSAS 
as 
demonstrated 
by

Gozal,13 
who 
reported 
that 
children 
with 
features 
of 
OSAS 
had 
better 
academic 
results 
after 
tonsillectomy 
and 
adenoidectomy 
than 
a 
similar 
group 
without 
tonsillectomy 
and 
adenoidectomy. 
Further 
studies 
are 
warranted 
to 
shed 
light 
on 
the 
relationship 
between 
OSAS 
and 
academic 
performance. 
It 
was 
interesting 
to 
note, 
in 
the 
current 
study, 
that 
sleep 
teeth 
grinding 
was 
associated 
with 
good 
academic 
performance 
in 
the 
current 
study. 
This 
was 
exactly 
the 
opposite 
of 
that 
reported 
by 
Agargun 
et 
al,14 
who 
suggested 
that 
bruxism 
might 
be 
associated 
with 
learning 
difficulties. 
We 
noted 
that 
teeth 
grinding 
was 
closely 
associated 
with 
habitual 
snoring 
in 
the 
current 
study 
and 
habitual 
snoring 
was 
a 
common 
symptom 
of 
OSAS 
that 
was 
associated 
with 
a 
learning 
problem.13 
The 
current 
study 
suggests 
that 
the 
two 
closely 
associated 
conditions, 
ie, 
habitual 
snoring 
and 
sleep 
teeth 
grinding, 
had 
an 
opposite 
effect 
on 
academic 
results. 
This 
probably 
explained 
why 
Urschitz 
et 
al15 
found 
no 
association 
between 
habitual 
snoring 
and 
academic 
results 
in 
primary 
school 
children, 
as 
the 
confounding 
effect 
of 
sleep

Cheung 
and 
Leung-Ngai19 
found 
that 
primary 
school 
students 
in 
Hong 
Kong 
spent 
1.5 
to 
2 
h 
daily 
doing 
homework, 
which 
was 
longer 
than 
that 
reported 
from 
America 
and 
Asia.20 
In 
addition, 
anxiety 
symptoms 
and 
depression 
symptoms 
were 
significantly 
associated 
with 
homework 
hours 
in 
Hong 
Kong 
students.19 
The 
better 
academic 
results 
of 
those 
with 
teeth 
grinding 
in 
the 
current 
study 
could 
be 
mediated 
through 
the 
longer 
homework 
hours 
and, 
hence, 
stress 
in 
those 
higher 
achievers. 
Further 
studies 
to 
examine 
this 
relationship 
are 
warranted. 
The 
significant 
association 
between 
academic 
results 
and 
sleepiness 
during 
class 
or 
homework 
was 
similar 
to 
that 
found 
by 
Goodwin 
et 
al,7 
who 
found 
daytime 
sleepiness 
to 
be 
associated 
with 
learning 
problems. 


Chervin 
et 
al21 
reported 
that 
inattention 
and 
hyperactivity 
were 
more 
common 
in 
habitual 
snorers 
(OR, 
2.2; 
95% 
CI, 
1.4 
to 
3.6), 
and 
they 
showed 
that 
boys 
. 
8 
years 
old 
accounted 
for 
most 
of 
the 
association 
between 
hyperactivity 
and 
habitual 
snoring 
(but 
not 
sleepiness). 
A 
similar 
association 
was 
not 
identified 
by 
the 
current 
study 
using 
poor 
conduct 
as 
a 
marker 
for 
inattention 
and 
hyperactivity. 
This 
is 
most 
probably 
due 
to 
the 
difference 
in 
the 
study 
population, 
as 
53.8% 
of 
the 
current 
study 
population 
is 
. 
8 
year 
old 
(Fig 
1), 
compared 
to 
35% 
in 
the 
study 
by 
Chervin 
et 
al.21 
Variations 
in 
conduct 
scores 
could 
be 
attributed 
to 
different 
factors; 
in 
other 
words, 
personality 
traits, 
peer 
pressure, 
and 
assessment 
criteria 
of 
teachers 
and 
conduct 
scores 
might 
not 
be 
appropriate 
surrogate 
markers 
of 
inattention 
and 
hyperactivity. 


In 
the 
current 
study, 
EDS, 
defined 
as 
the 
presence 
of 
more 
than 
two 
daytime 
sleep 
symptoms, 
was 
found 
to 
be 
6.7%. 
This 
was 
similar 
to 
that 
reported 
by 
Goodwin 
et 
al,7 
who 
found 
EDS 
in 
5.8% 
of 
white 
children 
and 
9.6% 
of 
Hispanic 
children. 
In 
the 
current 
study, 
significant 
risk 
factors 
for 
EDS 
were 
similar 
to 
the 
clinical 
features 
of 
OSAS, 
ie, 
witnessed 
sleep 
apnea, 
habitual 
snoring, 
headache 
on 
rising, 
allergic 
rhinitis. 
This 
was 
similar 
to 
the 
findings 
of 
Gottlieb 
et 
al,22 
who 
found 
a 
strong 
association 
between 
symptoms 
of 
OSAS 
and 
EDS, 
defined 
as 
overly 
sleepy 
during 
the 
daytime 
at 
least 
once 
a 
week, 
in 
a 
group 
of 
5-year-old 
children. 


Hong 
Kong 
is 
a 
modern 
city 
with 
around-the-clock 
activities. 
It 
is 
common 
for 
both 
parents 
to 
work, 
and 
they 
often 
come 
home 
late 
for 
dinner. 
This 
results 
in 
a 
routine 
that 
encourages 
children 
to 
sleep 
late 
but 
wake 
up 
early 
for 
school 
because 
of 
heavy 
traffic. 
Hence, 
it 
is 
not 
surprising 
that 
the 
parent-reported 
sleep 
duration 
of 
8.79 
h 
(SD, 
0.96) 
in 
our 
study 
is 
much 
shorter 
than 
the 
parent-reported 
sleep 
dura-

It 
is 
also 
similar 
to 
the 
shortest 
sleep 
duration 
reported 
in 
the 
literature, 
that 
of 
the 
Israeli 
pupils.23 
Acute

has

to 
impair 
higher 
cognitive 
functions, 
eg, 
verbal 
creativity 
and 
abstract 
thinking.24 
Sadeh 
et 
al25 
reported 
no 
correlation 
between 
total 
sleep 
duration 
and 
neurobehavioral 
functioning 
in 
135 
7-to 
13-year-old 
Israeli 
children, 
although 
they 
did 
show 
a 
significant 
adverse 
impact 
of 
decreased 
sleep 
percentage, 
ie, 
percentage 
of 
true 
sleep 
time 
over 
total 
sleep 
period, 
on 
neurobehavioral 
functioning 
in 
the 
7-to 
9-yearage 
group. 
Gau 
and 
Soong26 
also 
reported 
nighttime 
sleep 
duration 
on 
school 
days 
was 
significantly 
related 
to 
alertness 
in 
the 
morning. 
These 
reported 
findings 
might 
well 
explain 
the 
finding 
in 
the 
current 
study 
that 
those 
scored 
poorly 
in 
the 
academic 
results 
had 
a 
shorter 
duration 
of 
sleep, 
an 
average 
reduction 
of 
13.76 
min. 
This 
result 
echoes 
the 
findings 
by 
Epstein 
et 
al,27 
that 
a 
24-min 
reduction 
in 
sleep 
duration 
resulted 
in 
“increased 
prevalence 
of 
difficulties 
in 
concentrating 
and 
paying 
attention 
during 
classes.” 
In 
the 
current 
study, 
sleepiness 
during 
class 
and 
homework, 
which 
might 
be 
an 
indirect 
marker 
for 
sleep 
inadequacy, 
were 
shown 
to 
be 
significant 
risk 
factors 
for 
poor 
academic 
results. 


In 
the 
current 
study 
population, 
primary 
school 
boys 
slept 
significantly 
more 
than 
girls. 
This 
was 
exactly 
opposite 
to 
that 
reported 
for 
American 
children8 
and 
Israeli 
children.26 
The 
Hong 
Kong 
girls 
slept 
less 
than 
their 
American 
and 
Israeli 
counterparts, 
and 
this 
may 
be 
attributed 
to 
the 
heavier 
academic 
workload 
in 
Hong 
Kong.19 


The 
prevalence 
of 
NE 
was 
similar 
to 
that 
reported 
previously 
in 
Hong 
Kong6 
and 
China.5 
Similar 
to 
a 
previous 
report,6 
boys 
were 
found 
to 
be 
twice 
as 
likely 
to 
be 
enuretic 
as 
girls. 
As 
previously 
reported 
by 
Brooks 
and 
Topol,28 
we 
found 
witnessed 
sleep 
apnea 
to 
be 
a 
significant 
risk 
factor 
that 
approached 
significance 
for 
primary 
NE. 
Hence, 
OSAS 
should 
be 
actively 
looked 
for 
in 
enuretic 
children. 


The 
prevalence 
of 
sleep 
teeth 
grinding 
was 
higher 
than 
that 
reported 
previously 
from 
students 
in 
Turkey 
with 
similar 
age 
groups.14 
However, 
the 
prevalence 
in 
the 
current 
study 
was 
similar 
to 
that 
reported 
in 
Canadian 
children 
(aged 
3 
to 
10 
years)18 
and 
American 
college 
students.29,30 
The 
sleep 
teeth 
grinding 
was 
found 
to 
be 
associated 
with 
habitual 
snoring 
in 
the 
current 
study. 
This 
was 
similar 
to 
that 
reported 
previously.30,31 
Further 
study 
into 
the 
mechanism 
underlying 
this 
association 
is 
warranted. 


The 
main 
limitation 
of 
the 
current 
study 
was 
the 
rather 
low 
participation 
rate, 
as 
only 
68.8% 
of 
those 
approached 
agreed 
to 
the 
study, 
and 
this 
might 
invoke 
a 
degree 
of 
selection 
bias 
in 
favor 
of 
recruit


ing 
those 
who 
had 
sleep 
symptoms. 
This 
was 
reflected 
by 
significantly 
more 
boys 
than 
girls 
in 
the 
studied 
population. 
This 
would 
result 
in 
an 
overestimation 
of 
the 
snoring 
symptom 
as 
allergic 
rhinitis; 
a 
main 
risk 
factor 
for 
snoring 
was 
more 
likely 
to 
occur 
in 
boys.11 
Nonetheless, 
the 
prevalence 
of 
doctor-diagnosed 
asthma 
and 
allergic 
rhinitis 
were 
comparable 
with 
that 
obtained 
previously 
in 
Hong 
Kong 
children. 
Hence, 
the 
population 
selection 
might 
not 
be 
significantly 
different 
from 
the 
general 
population. 
This 
leads 
us 
to 
believe 
that 
our 
survey 
return 
rate 
of 
68.8% 
was 
a 
good 
representation 
of 
the 
general 
primary 
school 
population 
in 
Hong 
Kong. 


Symptoms 
in 
children 
were 
reported 
by 
parents 
without 
any 
independent 
verification 
(eg, 
overnight 
polysomnography, 
nocturnal 
home 
pulse 
oximetry, 
and 
actigraphy) 
in 
the 
current 
study. 
This 
was 
the 
intrinsic 
problem 
of 
all 
postal 
or 
telephonic 
questionnaires. 
Subjective 
reporting 
of 
symptoms 
by 
parents 
might 
underestimate 
the 
incidence 
and 
severity 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing.32 
Moreover, 
overlapping 
of 
sleep 
time 
of 
parents 
and 
children 
decreased 
the 
likelihood 
of 
parental 
witnessing 
of 
sleep 
problems. 
Further 
similar 
study 
should 
be 
augmented 
with 
polysomnography 
or 
videotaping 
of 
sleep 
to 
verify 
the 
symptoms 
reported 
by 
parents. 
A 
drawback 
in 
the 
current 
study 
involved 
the 
lack 
of 
data 
on 
obesity, 
a 
well-known 
risk 
factor 
for 
sleep 
disordered 
breathing.33 
Future 
epidemiologic 
study 
should 
address 
the 
issue 
of 
obesity 
and 
sleep 
problems. 


In 
conclusion, 
the 
current 
study 
identified 
the 
prevalence 
of 
habitual 
snoring 
and 
witnessed 
apnea 
in 
Chinese 
children, 
and 
it 
was 
similar 
to 
the 
white 
population. 
Sleep 
deprivation 
is 
a 
common 
phenomenon 
in 
Hong 
Kong 
children. 
Daytime 
sleepiness 
and 
witnessed 
sleep 
apnea 
were 
associated 
with 
poor 
academic 
results.

Dear 
Parents, 


I 
am 
the 
consultant 
pediatrician 
of 
the 
“Children 
Sleep 
Disorder 
Service” 
of 
Kwong 
Wah 
Hospital. 
I 
am 
inviting 
you 
to 
participate 
in 
a 
research 
program 
in 
our 
hospital. 
Approximately 
10% 
of 
children 
are 
found 
to 
have 
snoring 
at 
night 
in 
many 
surveys. 
Among 
them, 
OSAS 
was 
diagnosed 
in 
10%. 
In 
our 
Children 
Sleep 
Disorder 
Unit, 
we 
have 
seen 
109 
children 
with 
OSAS 
in 
352 
snoring 
children 
since 
1997. 


The 
aim 
of 
this 
sleep 
survey 
is 
to 
investigate 
the 
sleep 
problems 
of 
primary 
school 
children 
in 
Hong 
Kong. 
You 
need 
to 
observe 
your 
child’s 
sleep 
habits 
for 
1 
week. 
Our 
researcher 
will 
call 
you 
and 
ask 
some 
questions. 
All 
the 
information 
provided 
is 
only 
for 
research 
purpose, 
and 
it 
will 
be 
kept 
strictly 
confidential. 
You 
have 
the 
right 
to 
reject 
this 
survey. 
In 
addition, 
you 
may 
withdraw
