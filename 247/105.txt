Abstract 

Objectives: Childhood sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) has been associated with poor school performance. Both problems are common 
among African–American (AA) children, but potential confounders such as low socioeconomic status (SES) and obesity have not been well 
studied. 

Methods: Children in second and fifth grades at six urban elementary schools were evaluated by teachers’ ratings and year-end reading 
and math assessments. Risk for SDB was assessed with the validated parental Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire, and SES by qualification for 
school lunch assistance. 

Results: Among 146 children whose parents completed surveys, risk for SDB was associated with AA race, low SES, and poor teacher 
ratings ðP , 
0:01Þ, but not assessment scores ðP . 
0:1Þ. In multiple regression models, poor school performance was consistently and 
independently predicted by low SES ðP , 
0:01Þ 
but not by AA race or SDB risk. Risk for SDB was associated with low SES before, but not 
after body mass index (BMI) was taken into account. 

Conclusions: The SDB symptoms, AA race, and low SES all vary to some extent with poor school performance, but the only consistent 
and independent covariate of performance is SES. Risk for SDB is associated with low SES, perhaps because of a third variable, namely high 
BMI.

1. Introduction 
Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) affects at least 1–3% of 
children [1], and cognitive impairments may be among the 
most important consequences of the condition [2]. For 
example, in a study of 297 poorly performing first grade 
children, 54 (18%) showed evidence of SDB [3]; those 
who were treated showed significantly better grades the 
following year, whereas those not treated showed no 
improvement. In addition, a subsequent study of seventh 
and eighth grade students showed that earlier childhood 
snoring – a common symptom of SDB – predicted current 
school performance [4]. Neuropsychometric studies suggest

that SDB, even when mild, may impair executive functions 
crucial to good school performance [5–7]. 

School performance also varies with racial background, 
and this observation is a frequent cause of concern in the lay 
press. An ‘achievement gap’ between African–American 
(AA) children and their peers has been variously attributed 
to differential resources, pre-school experiences, adult 
expectations, and other factors [8]. At the same time, 
cross-sectional studies have suggested that AA children 
have SDB at 3–4 times the frequency of non-AA children 
[9], and that when present, SDB may be more severe among 
AA than non-AA children [10]. Neither the studies of SDB 
in AA children, those of SDB and school performance, nor 
many of the studies of achievement gap have accounted for 
socioeconomic status (SES), a potentially important 
confounder. Whether an increased frequency of SDB

among AA children could explain part of the achievement 
gap has not been studied. 

We therefore surveyed parents of second and fifth grade 
students, in an urban school district, about the sleep of their 
children, and compared these data to subjective and objective 
performance measures provided by the children’s 
schools. We sought to determine whether poor school 
performance is associated with SDB symptoms, AA race, 
or SES, and to test the hypothesis that an increased 
frequency of SDB might help to explain poor performance 
among AA children in comparison to non-AA children. 

2. Methods 
2.1. Subjects and setting 
On May 29, 2001, students attending second and fifth 
grades in the six public elementary schools of the Ypsilanti 
School District took home cover letters, parental consent 
forms, child assent forms, and surveys. Several days later, 
to maximize yield, a second packet of consents and surveys 
was sent out again. Neither parents nor children were 
compensated directly for their participation. However, as 
incentives to the schools, the two with the highest questionnaire 
return rates from students were given $200 to spend 
for the benefit of the students. The second and fifth grades 
were chosen for this study because second graders are at an 
age when adenotonsillar hypertrophy is typically prominent, 
fifth graders have had an additional 3 years to develop any 
consequences of SDB, and objective performance assessments 
were available for all students in these two grades. 
The study was approved by the University of Michigan IRB 
and the research committee for the school system. 

Questionnaires were considered completed and were 
included in analyses when data were available on teacher-
rated performance, racial background, and SDB scores. 
Questionnaire packets were distributed to teachers or principals 
of 806 students, and 145 (18%) were completed. 
Participation rates among the six schools ranged from 13 
to 33%. In comparison to other surveys performed in this 
school district, which serves a highly urbanized community 
about 30 miles west of Detroit, this overall participation rate 
was considered by a district administrator to be excellent: 
previous surveys for research purposes had generated only 
single-digit response rates. 

For comparison to the study sample, the District provided 
the following data. Fifty-two percent of all students are male, 
and 59% of elementary school students qualify for school 
lunch assistance. District student racial distributions are: 
0.2% American Indian, 2.0% Asian or Pacific Islander, 
54% Black, 2.7% Hispanic, 41.1% White, and 2.4% multiracial. 


2.2. Measures 
Two measures of student performance were included. 

First, teachers rated the students’ overall performance, relative 
to their classmates, using a 5-point Likert scale from 1 
(worse) to 5 (better). Though not validated against other 
performance measures, this variable provided concise 
summary data collected in a similar manner and at the 
same time point from all teachers. Second, a district-wide 
grade-specific reading and mathematics assessment, administered 
in the school district annually, was used as an 
objective score. This instrument, the Wayne RESA Benchmark 
(Wayne RESA Assessment and Evaluation Services, 
Wayne, MI, USA), was developed to assess the degree to 
which school systems successfully teach material outlined 
in the Michigan Curriculum Framework (Standards and 
Benchmarks). The mathematics section has 35 multiple-
choice items for second graders and 59 items for fifth 
graders. The reading section has 40 items for second graders 
and 60 items for fifth graders. No cut-point scores or normative 
data are available, but the 2001 district-wide average 
second grade scores were 52 ^18 (s.d.) % in math and 
61 ^ 24% in reading; fifth grade scores averaged 
46 ^ 17% in math and 69 ^ 19% in reading. Children’s 
scores were used in the current study as a relative measure 
of the extent to which each had learned the year-long curriculum. 
The Benchmark evaluation was designed to avoid 
racial and gender bias, and was subjected to formal gender 
and racial bias review. It has not been reported, in several 
years of use, to show differential functioning for race or 
gender (Wayne RESA Assessment and Evaluation Services, 
personal communication). 

Additional variables collected in this study included 
parent-reported race, which was then classified into one 
(occasionally more) of six categories commonly used by 
the Department of Health and Human Services. SES was 
determined by identifying participation in the school lunch 
assistance program, qualification for which involves an 
objective assessment of financial need. Specifically, eligibility 
for either free or reduced-price lunches is based on 
family income and the number of dependents in the family, 
as determined from a Department of Social Services registry 
or an application from parents to Food Services, an agency 
of the Department of Agriculture. 

The risk of SDB was assessed with a validated subscale 
of the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire [11]. Question-items 
ask about snoring frequency and loudness, breathing during 
sleep, daytime sleepiness, and other behaviors. In a 
previous study of children with polysomnographically 
confirmed SDB and controls, the full 22-item SDB 
subscale showed a sensitivity of 81% and specificity of 
87%, and correctly classified 85% of the subjects [11]. In 
the current study, the SDB scale was used without six 
items – those that ask about inattention and hyperactivity 

– to avoid artificial associations with poor school performance. 
The excluded items are not disproportionately 
important to overall performance of the scale [11]. Children 
at high risk for SDB have SDB subscale scores $0.33 
(i.e. 33% of symptoms present).

2.3. Analysis 
Data were summarized as proportions or means and standard 
deviations. Teacher-rated performance did not follow a 
normal distribution and was dichotomized to poor performance 
(rating of 1 or 2) and adequate performance (ratings 
of 3, 4, or 5). Logistic regression models were then 
constructed to assess associations between poor performance 
and normalized SDB symptom scores, race (AA 
vs. non-AA), and SES (lunch assistance vs. none). In an 
analogous manner, the normally distributed Benchmark 
total scores (average of percent correct on reading and 
math sections) were regressed (multiple linear regression) 
on the explanatory variables. All regressions controlled for 
grade level. In analyses designed to determine what variables 
may contribute to risk for SDB, high risk was modeled 
by multiple logistic regression on SES, and several potential 
confounders that could be associated with both SDB and 
SES: normalized body mass index (BMI, kg/m2), asthma, 
AA race, and typical hours in bed (rise time–bedtime). 
Analyses were performed with SASw, version 8.1 (SAS 
Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). The level of significance 
was set at P , 
0:05.

was 11.1 ^0.4 years. Among 
second grade students, 36 (42%) were males, and among 
fifth grade students, 22 (37%) were males. Race was 
reported by parents as follows: four (3%) American Indian 
or Alaskan Native; seven (5%) Asian or Pacific Islander; 61 
(42%) Black, non-Hispanic; 77 (53%) White, non-Hispanic; 
ten (7%) Hispanic; six (4%) other or unknown. The total 
race reports ðn ¼

exceeds the number of subjects ðn ¼

because some parents listed more than one race for 
individual children. 

Parental identification of AA race, with or without additional 
racial backgrounds, was significantly associated with 
the SDB score (Wilcoxon rank sums, P ¼ 
0:0062) and with 
lunch assistance (chi-square, P ¼ 
0:0013). Also, the SDB 
score was associated with lunch assistance (Wilcoxon, 
P ¼ 
0:0036). Among 63 children who received lunch assistance, 
12 (19%) had high SDB scores, whereas among 82 
children without lunch assistance, only four (5%) had similarly 
high SDB scores. 

3.2. Poor performance and low benchmark scores 
Poor teacher-rated performance was associated with AA 
race, increased SDB scores, and lunch assistance (Table 2). 
Benchmark scores showed inverse associations with AA 
race and lunch assistance, but no significant association 
with SDB score (Table 3 and Fig. 1). Habitual snoring 
alone, assessed with one Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire 
item by parents of 139 subjects, was associated similarly 
with poor teacher-rated performance (chi-square ¼

Among 22 children with habitual snoring, seven (32%) had 
poor teacher-rated performance, whereas among 117 non-

(bottom panel). Box plots show median (dark bar), 25th (bottom of box), 
75th (top of box), 10th (bottom serif), and 90th (top serif) percentiles. 


Multiple logistic regression models that simultaneously 
included AA race, SDB score, and lunch assistance (and 
grade level) showed that poor teacher-rated performance 
was still associated with lunch assistance (OR ¼ 
13:76, 
P ¼ 
0:0002) after controlling for the other variables. 
However, neither AA race (OR ¼ 
2:18, P ¼ 
0:15) nor 
SDB score (OR ¼ 
1:29, P ¼ 
0:25) retained a significant 
association with poor performance after accounting for 
lunch assistance. An analogous multiple linear regression 
of Benchmark total score on the explanatory variables 
showed that both AA race (100 £ 
Part R2 ¼ 
4:55, 
P ¼ 
0:0077) and lunch assistance (100 £ 
Part R2 ¼ 
5:82, 
P ¼ 
0:0027) retained significance, but SDB score did not 
(100 £ 
Part R2 ¼ 
0:04, P ¼ 
0:80). 

In exploratory analyses, Benchmark reading and math 
scores separately were regressed on explanatory variables 
in simple and then multiple linear regression models. The 
results for reading and math were uniformly similar to each 
other and to the Benchmark total score results presented 
previously. 

3.3. Correlates of SDB risk 
Several potential third variables from parent questionnaires 
were tested in an effort to explain the association, 
between low SES and SDB risk, that had left no discernable 
association between SDB risk and performance. The SES, 
BMI, presence of asthma, race, and reported hours spent in 
bed are shown in Table 4 for all subjects, those at high risk 
for SDB, and those at low risk. Multivariable logistic regression 
models showed that low SES retained association with 
high SDB risk after adjusting for asthma history, AA race, 
or hours in bed. However, low SES showed no association 
with high SDB risk after including BMI in the model (Table 
5). A multiple stepwise logistic regression to evaluate high 
SDB risk considering low SES, BMI, asthma, AA race, and 
hours in bed excluded SES and confirmed that high SDB 
risk was best explained by BMI (beta ¼ 
0:78, s:e: ¼ 
0:31, 
OR ¼ 
2:2 ½1:2; 4:2) and asthma (beta ¼ 
1:5, s:e: ¼ 
0:77, 
OR ¼ 
4:7 ½1:0; 21:7). These results implied that high BMI 
was associated with low SES: a logistic regression showed a 
trend (beta ¼ 
0:38, s:e: ¼ 
0:22, OR ¼ 
1:5 ½1:0; 2:3). 

Among 139 children with data on habitual snoring, 61 
were classified as low SES and 14 (23%) of these snored 
habitually, whereas 78 children were not classified as low 
SES and only eight (10%) of these snored habitually 
(chi-square ¼ 
4:1, P ¼ 
0:04). Low SES was a significant 
correlate of habitual snoring (beta ¼ 
0:96, s:e: ¼ 
0:48, 
OR ¼ 
2:6 ½1:0; 7:0) before, but not after, adjustment for 
BMI (beta ¼ 
0:48, s:e: ¼ 
0:64, OR ¼ 
1:6 ½0:4; 5:8). 

4. Discussion 
This study of second and fifth grade students in an urban 
public school system shows that SDB symptoms, AA race, 
and SES all vary with academic performance, but the only

variable independently associated with both objective and 
teacher-rated performance is SES. High unadjusted SDB 
symptom scores showed an association with poor teacher-
rated performance, but not low test results. Low SES, as 
assessed by qualification for a lunch assistance program, 
was strongly associated with high SDB scores, which 
showed no significant association with performance after 
SES was taken into account. Similarly, accounting for 
SES substantially reduced or eliminated the association 
between AA race and performance measures. 

Several potential correlates of low SES – BMI, asthma, 
and AA race – were also associated with SDB risk, but only 
BMI explained a large part of the association between low 
SES and SDB risk. While correlative studies cannot prove 
causality, if low SES does increase SDB risk, the current 
results suggest that the effect may be mediated by increased 
obesity [9]. Although care must be taken in the extrapolation 
of results because of the low participation, the findings raise 
important considerations in interpretation of previous 
reports that childhood SDB is associated with poor school 
performance. Finally, an excess frequency of SDB among 
AA children does not appear to be a direct explanation for 
the ‘achievement gap’. 

Few previous reports have examined associations 
between SES and risk for childhood SDB. One study of 
4–5 years old children reported that lower SES, as defined 
by a father’s manual as opposed to non-manual work, was 
associated with increased SDB symptoms before, but not

after maternal smoking was taken into account [12]. 
However, BMI was not studied, the SDB questionnaire-
items had been validated without polysomnography, and 
the six SDB symptoms analyzed included three (coughs 
and colds, restless sleep, and problem related to sleeping) 
that may assess overall sleep quality rather than SDB specifically. 
Overall sleep quality is known to correlate with SES 
among adults [13]. For example, a French survey of 5622 
people aged 15 years or more found that lower family 
income correlated with insomnia [14]. A subsequent study 
of 205,347 French patients showed that those with low 
buying power, more often than others, reported that they 
suffered from a sleep disorder [15]. Neither of these studies, 
however, focused on SDB. In one previous study of 496 
adults, more specific questionnaire evidence of snoring 
and SDB showed no association with ‘socio-professional’ 
categories [16]. 

Why our subjects from poor families tended to have high 
body mass indices is uncertain. These children may have 
higher calorie, less nutritive diets more likely to produce 
obesity. Such children may have few opportunities for 
sports and other activities that could reduce weight. In 
developed countries, persons with low SES are more likely 
to be overweight, although the association is stronger and 
more consistent among adults than among children [17]. 
Obesity among children from low-income families is a 
growing public health problem in the US [18], especially 
in this state (Michigan), which has one of the highest 
frequencies of childhood obesity. Adenotonsillar hypertrophy 
and craniofacial anomalies may be the most frequent 
anatomical features in childhood SDB, but obesity is also a 
known correlate in this age group [9], and the importance of 
obesity is likely to grow as obesity becomes more prevalent. 

Besides obesity and perhaps maternal smoking, several 
unstudied variables, to which children might be more 
vulnerable than adults, also could contribute to an association 
between lower SES and SDB risk. Low SES is associated 
with poor health overall, deficient diets, more limited 
access to health services, and lower participation in health 
promotion activities such as non-emergent routine care. 
Untreated adenotonsillar hypertrophy or asthma increases 
the risk for SDB [9,19]. Low SES may also be associated 


R.D. Chervin et al. / Sleep Medicine 4 (2003) 21–27 
with insufficient sleep or poor sleep hygiene, due to parents’ 
work schedules, the sleeping environment, or other factors. 
Inadequate sleep could increase SDB scores by making children 
more sleepy, and if chronic, directly increase the risk 
for SDB [20]. 

Consistent with our data, previous investigations also 
found an association between poor grades and childhood 
SDB [3,4], but evidence that SDB actually causes or contributes 
to poor grades has not been conclusive. One study that 
showed improvement in school grades 1 year after treatment 
for SDB relied on parents, not randomization, to decide 
whether to pursue treatment for SDB [3]. Obesity, SES, 
access to health care, and related factors often have not 
been assessed, though one study did match high performing 
students to low performers who lived on the same street or 
nearby, in an effort to match for SES [4]. Additional 
evidence that SDB could affect school performance arose 
from studies that documented neurocognitive deficits and 
hyperactive behavior in association with SDB or related 
symptoms [5,7,21], but these studies also did not control 
for SES. One study found relative deficits in attention, 
memory, and intelligence in 16 snoring children who were 
compared to 16 non-snoring controls [6]. This study did 
adjust for maternal occupation, but this measure of SES 
showed no association with snoring or most psychometric 
results, perhaps due to sample size limitations or imprecision 
of the SES measure. The current results suggest that 
future studies of SDB, race, and school performance should 
incorporate more direct measures of SES and obesity. 

Current results also suggest that detection of associations 
between school performance and SDB may depend on the 
performance measure used. Previous studies that relied on 
teachers’ grades to gauge performance found associations 
with SDB [3,4]. Our study suggests that objective test scores 
may not show these associations. Teachers’ grades may 
reflect other factors – hyperactive and disruptive classroom 
behavior, for example – that could be influenced by SDB or 
SES [21,22]. 

In contrast to sleep-related studies, a number of previous 
reports on achievement did address SES. Data collected by 
the National Longitudinal Survey from approximately 2000 
children suggest a strong effect of family financial capital on 
math and reading scores [23]. Family income shows an 
association with achievement and ability-related outcomes 
in studies of children [24] and, more specifically, AA children 
[8,25]. Furthermore, the achievement gap can persist 
between Black and White populations after stratification by 
SES levels, though test-specific characteristics also could 
explain such results [26]. 

This study is the first, to the authors’ knowledge, to examine 
the possibility that an increased frequency of SDB could 
contribute to poor school performance among AA children. 
The data, which do not support the hypothesis, demonstrate 
the importance of a broad analysis of multiple factors likely 
to contribute to poor school achievement. However, the idea 
that SDB may contribute to an achievement gap cannot be 

discounted definitively by current results. The study design 
was correlational, and unsuspected confounders could have 
obscured underlying relationships. Moreover, gold-standard 
measures were abandoned in favor of instruments that 
would cause less disruption of the school day and permit 
inclusion of larger numbers of subjects. The Pediatric Sleep 
Questionnaire has good validity but is not equivalent to 
polysomnography. Qualification for the public school 
lunch assistance program requires an objective and relatively 
rigorous screening of family finances, but every qualified 
family may not apply. SES can be assessed in more 
detail, rather than a single dichotomous measure, by other 
methods. Lunch assistance conceivably could affect food 
consumption and obesity in some manner not directly 
related to SES. Perhaps most importantly, our survey return 
rate of 18% – though commendable in this urban school 
setting – raises the possibility that the sample was not representative 
of the target population. However, the sample did 
not show major differences with the entire school district in 
racial composition or SES. In addition, any selection bias 
that might have affected frequencies or levels of study variables 
probably would have had less effect on associations 
(between those variables) which form the main findings of 
this report. 

In conclusion, this study did not support the initial 
hypothesis that an increased frequency of SDB may 
explain a substantial portion of the achievement gap 
between AA and non-AA school children. Instead, a simple 
but objective measure of SES appeared to account for the 
association between SDB and poor performance, perhaps 
because low SES was associated with high BMI. Physicians, 
school nurses, and health officials whose work 
involves children from low-income families should be 
aware that these patients may be at increased risk for 
SDB. The question of whether AA children have increased 
risk for SDB because of their race, SES, BMI, or other 
factors remains an important public health question. The 
outcomes of SDB in children are poorly defined, and 
further research is needed to determine the extent to 
which SDB may have cognitive, behavioral, and academic 
consequences. However, such studies should account for 
SES and obesity, and attempt to determine whether these 
variables – as opposed to SDB or race – may explain 
associated morbidity.
