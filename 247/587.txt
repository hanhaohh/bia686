Behavior and Obstructive Sleep Apnea 
in Children: Is Obesity a Factor? 
Emily F. Rudnick, MD; Ron B. Mitchell, MD 
Objectives: Children with obstructive sleep apnea 
(OSA) frequently exhibit behavioral and neurocognitive 
problems. There is a high prevalence of OSA among obese 
children. This study aims to evaluate the relationship 
between OSA and behavioral problems in obese children 
as compared with normal-weight children (controls). 
Study Design: Prospective, nonrandomized, controlled 
study of obese and normal-weight children with 
OSA presenting to a tertiary medical center for 
adenotonsillectomy. 
Methods: All study participants underwent preoperative 
polysomnography to document OSA. Obesity was 
defined as age- and sex-adjusted body mass index at the 
95th percentile or higher. Behavior was evaluated using 
the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC). 
Preoperatively, the Behavioral Symptoms Index (BSI), a 
global measure of behavior, and BASC scores for obese 
and normal-weight children were compared using an unpaired 
t test. 
Results: The study population included 52 children, 
18 (35%) of whom were obese. The mean age of obese 
children was 8.6 (range, 2.0–14.9) years. The mean age of 
normal-weight children was 6.4 (range, 2.1–12.9) years. 
Demographics were otherwise similar. The mean apneahypopnea 
index for obese children was 17.2 (5.0–38.0) 
and for normal-weight children was 15.7 (5.3–88.0). The 
BSI score was 55.3 (SD, 15.9) for obese and 55.9 (SD, 15.0) 
for normal-weight children. Seven (38.9%) obese and 12 
(35.3%) normal-weight children had clinically significant 
or abnormal behavior. Similar results were seen for the 
BASC scales of atypicality, depression, hyperactivity, and 
somatization in both groups. 
Conclusions: Behavioral problems are highly prevalent 
in children with OSA. However, these problems exist 
independently of whether children are obese or normal 
weight. 
Key Words: Pediatric obesity, obstructive sleep 
apnea, behavior.

INTRODUCTION 
Obesity in children has increased dramatically over 
the last two decades and is now a priority focus of modern 
public health initiatives. In 2004, approximately 17% of 
children nationally were obese (95th percentile of sexand 
age-specific body mass index [BMI]).1 Obesity in children 
accounts for multiple physical sequelae that can 
cause significant health-related morbidity. In addition to 
known cardiovascular, pulmonary, and endocrine consequences, 
children with obesity are known to exhibit behavioral, 
neurocognitive, and psychosocial problems. Recent 
reports have shown that obese children experience 
decreased self-esteem, decreased quality of life, and increased 
depression.2 Obese children also display poorer 
academic performance when compared with age-matched 
peers.3,4 
Approximately one third of obese children exhibit 
sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) or obstructive sleep apnea 
(OSA).5 SDB represents a spectrum of sleep disturbances 
in children ranging from primary snoring to OSA. 
Several studies have shown that children with SDB experience 
problems with both behavior and neurocognition. 
Specifically, children with SDB have been noted to display 
hyperactivity, increased aggression, irritability, emotional 
and peer problems, and somatic complaints.6–8 Problems 
with neurocognition include decreased skills in memory, 
attention, and intelligence.8 These behavioral and neurocognitive 
deficits improve after surgical intervention with 
adenotonsillectomy.9 
Although behavioral problems have been associated 
with children with obesity and children with OSA, there is 
limited knowledge regarding the extent of behavioral 
problems in children who are both obese and have OSA. 
Therefore, this report evaluates the prevalence and severity 
of behavioral impairment in obese children with OSA 
(as documented by polysomnography) compared with 
healthy-weight controls.

METHODS 
The institutional review board approved this study. Children 
aged 2 to 18 years referred to the pediatric otolaryngology 
service with OSA, as documented by polysomnography, were 
included in the study. OSA was defined as an apnea-hypopnea 
index (AHI) of 5 or greater or an apnea index of 1 or greater. 
Children were excluded from the study if they had previously 
undergone adenotonsillectomy or if they exhibited craniofacial 
syndromes, neuromuscular disease, developmental delay, or 
known psychiatric disorders. 
Caregivers signed an informed consent document prior to 
enrollment in the study. Children with clinical symptoms of 
OSA (including snoring, daytime fatigue, and witnessed apnea 
during sleep) underwent polysomnography. Caregivers of children 
with OSA, as documented by polysomnography, were then 
asked to complete the Behavioral Assessment Survey for Children 
(BASC)10 prior to surgery. 
The age- and sex-corrected BMI was calculated for each 
child using established guidelines.1 Children were considered 
“obese” if they had a BMI-for-age at the 95th or greater percentile. 
Children with BMI-for-age at less than the 95th percentile 
were used as controls. 
Age-specific BASC instruments were used for the following 
age groups: 2.5 to 5 years, 6 to 11 years, and 12 to 18 years. The 
BASC behavioral scales used were aggression, anxiety, atypicality, 
depression, hyperactivity, and somatization. BASC composite 
scales are made up of several behavioral scales that are weighted 
differently as a function of age. This weighting reflects the relative 
contribution of individual scales to problem behaviors in 
different age groups. The composite scales used were the Behavioral 
Symptoms Index (BSI), externalizing problems, and internalizing 
problems. Only BASC scales and composites that were 
applicable to all age groups were included in this study. Raw 
scores on the BASC scales and composites were converted to 
T-scores with a mean of 50 and an SD of 10. Children who scored 
from 60 to 69 were considered to have “borderline” behavioral 
impairment. Children who scored 70 or above were considered to 
have “clinically significant” behavioral impairment. 
The AHI and BASC T scores of obese children and controls 
were compared using an unpaired t test. A P value less than or 
equal to .05 was considered significant. A comparison was also 
made between children with normal BASC T-scores (60) and 
children with abnormal T-scores (60). Statistical analyses were 
performed with SPSS, version 12.0 (Chicago, IL). 
A power analysis indicated that a sample size of 15 was 
adequate to detect a 10 point difference in BASC T-scores with 
80% power and   .05. Because a difference of 10 in a BASC 
T-score is clinically significant, the present study has sufficient 
power to detect a significant difference in behavior between 
groups. 
RESULTS 
The study population included 52 children, of whom 
18 (34.6%) were obese. Table I shows the demographics of 
obese children and controls with OSA. Overall, the mean 
age was 7.2 (range, 2.0 –14.9; SD, 3.4) years. The mean age 
of obese children was 8.6 years, and the mean age of 
controls was 6.4 years (P  .02). The predominant racial/ 
ethnic group was Hispanic (55.8%), followed by non- 
Hispanic white (28.8%) and Native American (9.6%). The 
mean AHI was 16.2 (range, 5.0–88.0; SD, 14.4). 
The mean BMI for the obese and control groups was 
26.3 (range, 18.9–37.9) and 17.0 (range, 13.5–24.8), respectively. 
This difference was significant (P  .001). 
Mean BASC T-scores with SD for the two groups of 
children with OSA are presented in Table II. For both 
groups of children, the BASC domain scale with the highest 
mean score was somatization, and the domain scale 
with the lowest mean score was aggression. There were no 
significant differences in scores for the BSI, externalizing 
symptoms, and internalizing symptom composite scales or 
for the individual behavioral scales of atypicality, depression, 
hyperactivity, aggression, and somatization between 
obese children and controls. 
Overall, 19 (36.5%) children had BSI scores that indicated 
borderline or clinically significant behavioral impairment 
(T  60), of whom 7 (13.5%) were obese. Eight 
(15.4%) children had scores that indicated borderline significant 
behavioral impairment (T  60 to 70), and 11 
(21.2%) children had scores that indicated clinically significant 
behavioral impairment (T  70). The demographics 
and mean BASC T-scores for the three composite scales 
in obese children and controls with borderline or clinically 
significant behavioral impairment are presented in Table 
III. There were no significant differences in age, AHI, or 
scores for the three composite scales between obese children 
and controls. There were no significant differences 
between BASC T-scores for obese children with borderline 
behavioral impairment compared with controls or obese

DISCUSSION 
To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to 
report that behavioral problems are highly prevalent in 
both obese and normal-weight children with OSA and that 
these problems exist independently of whether children 
are obese. This study uses a validated instrument to evaluate 
behavior in obese children and normal-weight children 
with polysomnography-proven OSA. 
In the present study, greater than one third of both 
obese and normal-weight children with OSA had clinically 
significant behavioral impairment that was not influenced 
by age, sex, or ethnicity. The BASC10 survey was used because 
it is age-specific and is intended to specifically quantify 
emotional and behavioral impairment as well as socialization 
skills in children. Numerous other studies have used 
validated instruments to show a significant correlation between 
OSA and behavioral problems in children. Previous 
studies using the Conners’ Rating Scale11 showed that children 
with SDB are more likely to show inattentive, aggressive, 
and hyperactive behavior.6,7 Other reports have evaluated 
behavior using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL),12 
concluding that children with SDB are more anxious and 
depressed, display poorer attention and socialization, and 
have increased aggression when compared with healthy controls.
8 In addition to documenting a high prevalence of behavioral 
problems in children with OSA, behavior and OSA 
have been shown to significantly improve after treatment 
with adenotonsillectomy.9 
Although behavioral problems in children with OSA 
are clearly documented, behavioral problems in children 
with obesity are less well defined. Datar and Sturm13 
evaluated 9,949 nationally representative kindergartners 
by using teacher- and parent-reported behavioral questionnaires 
that identified problems according to internalizing 
and externalizing symptom scales. The teacher and 
parent questionnaires were modified from the Social 
Skills Rating System instrument,14 a validated tool used 
to assess problems with adaptive and social skills in children. 
They showed that behavioral symptoms were increased 
only in girls at the start of kindergarten and that 
obesity did not independently predict development of behavioral 
problems in boys or girls during the first 2 school 
years. In contrast, Lumeng et al.,4 in a study of 755 children 
aged 8 to 11 years from a nationally representative 
cohort, showed that behavioral problems were independently 
associated with obesity and that normal-weight 
children with behavioral problems were more likely to 
become overweight within 2 years. This study evaluated 
behavior using the Behavioral Problems Index,15 a derivative 
of the original CBCL, and was adjusted for demographic 
variables including age, sex, ethnicity, and maternal 
risk factors. Clearly, a relationship exists between 
childhood obesity and behavioral problems; however, future 
studies are needed to better define what demographic 
and environmental factors determine this association. 
The prevalence of SDB in children with obesity is 
alarmingly high, reported as up to 40%.5 Knowing that 
behavioral problems exist in increased frequency in populations 
of children with OSA and in children who are 
obese, a reasonable expectation would be for obese children 
with OSA to have an even higher prevalence of 
behavioral problems and possibly more severe behavioral 
impairment. However, in the present study, no significant 
differences were found in either the prevalence or severity 
of behavioral problems when obese children with OSA 
were compared with normal-weight controls. 
This study offers strengths in that it has a prospective, 
controlled design. Children evaluated were objectively 
diagnosed with OSA using polysomnography, and a 
nationally standardized BMI for age was used to measure 
obesity. Likewise, behavioral problems were evaluated 
with the BASC, a globally validated instrument. 
A number of limitations in this study require further 
discussion. First, the BASC instrument is not disease 
specific for OSA. Likewise, the BASC instrument does not 
measure neurocognitive impairment, which may be impacted 
differently in obese children with OSA. Next, because 
of the small number of children in the study, the 
effect of covariates such as age, sex, and ethnicity could 
not be fully evaluated using the current data. In addition, 
the children evaluated in this study were not representative 
of the general pediatric population, which would include 
children of a broader demographic and socioeconomic 
distribution. Finally, behavioral data were collected 
at only one point in time, so the long-term relationship 
between obesity, OSA, and behavioral problems in children 
is unknown and is the subject of ongoing current 
research. Despite these limitations, this study clearly 
identifies a high prevalence of behavioral problems in 
children with OSA that is independent of obesity. 
CONCLUSIONS 
Behavioral problems are highly prevalent in children 
with OSA. However, these problems exist independently 
of whether children are obese or normal weight.
