INTRODUCTION 

SLEEP-DISORDERED BREATHING (SDB) IS A COMMON MEDICAL 
DISORDER IN ADULTS THAT IS INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZED 
IN CHILDREN, estimated to occur in 1% to 3% of children.1,2 
It is characterized by habitual snoring and recurrent apneic and hypopneic 
episodes that disrupt nocturnal ventilation and sleep quality. Failure 
to diagnose and treat SDB can result in serious, but generally 
reversible consequences for the child, including impaired growth, neurocognitive 
and behavioral dysfunction, and cardiorespiratory failure.3 
In childhood, SDB is commonly associated with adenotonsillar hypertrophy. 
Most children will have symptomatic resolution of SDB following 
adenotonsillectomy.4 The impact of SDB on functional outcomes 
in children is not well characterized. Increasing attention is being 
paid to the potential negative impact of SDB on daytime neurocognitive 
and behavioral dysfunction.5-13 

Measurement of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is increasingly 
recognized to provide important information to describe the health 
status of various clinical samples and to gauge the effects of healthcare 
delivery systems or specific interventions.14 In adults, SDB is associated 
with impaired quality of life, especially decreases in vitality and 
physical functioning scales as measured by a HRQOL tool, the SF-36.15 
The relationship between SDB and impaired HRQOL is well recognized 
in adults,15-27 but little attention has been paid to the impact of SDB and 
its treatment on HRQOL in children. 

Measurement of HRQOL provides an opportunity to assess the 
impact of SDB on the child’s daily activities, physical symptoms, social 
interactions, and emotional well being. Uncertainty about diagnostic

ing (SDB) was assessed with overnight in-home monitoring that recorded 
nasal-oral airflow, pulse oximetry, chest-wall impedance, and heart rate. 
Using logistic regression analyses, each CHQ scale outcome was analyzed 
independently for the effect of SDB, adjusting for other potential 
confounding variables and for family-correlated data. Significant differences 
in overall physical health and complaints of bodily pain were 
observed in children with generally mild levels of SDB. Relationships persisted 
after adjustment for age, gender, ethnicity, obesity, and asthma. 
Conclusions: SDB in children is associated with measurably lower levels 
of specific dimensions of HRQOL in children. Decrements in HRQOL are 
measurable even for children with mild SDB, with increasing effects 
observed with more severe SDB. 
Key words: Health status; quality of life; sleep apnea syndromes; child 

strategies and treatment indications for SDB in children underscores the 
importance of considering HRQOL in the assessment of health outcomes. 
Several recent reports have described the development and validation 
of disease-specific HRQOL instruments for SDB or adenotonsillar 
disease in children.28-31 None of these studies have examined the 
relationship between measured SDB and generic HRQOL in children. 

In this study, we used data from the ongoing community-based 
genetic-epidemiologic Cleveland Family Study (CFS) cohort to determine 
the impact of SDB on a generic HRQOL measure in children. 
Specifically, we assessed the extent to which SDB was associated with 
impairment of generic HRQOL using the Child Health Questionnaire 
(CHQ).32 We hypothesized that higher levels of SDB would have a negative 
impact on HRQOL in children. 

METHODS 

Participants 

The study population consisted of children 5 to 17 years of age 
enrolled in the on-going CFS, a community-based genetic-epidemiologic 
study of SDB. The larger cohort consisted of index and control families, 
recruited using methods previously described.33,34 In brief, “index” 
families were identified because one member (the proband) had laboratory-
confirmed sleep apnea. Neighborhood control families were chosen 
randomly from a list of names provided by the index proband of 
neighbors or friends with living relatives who resided in the area. Over 
the last 4 years, pediatric HRQOL assessment was added to the study 
protocol and African-American families were over-sampled. Children 
with chronic medical conditions such as genetic or craniofacial syndromes; 
chronic orthopedic, bone, or joint problems; chronic rheumatic 
disease; developmental delay or mental retardation; diabetes; epilepsy; 
or deafness were excluded from the study, but children with asthma were 
included. 

Protocol 

The study visits were described in greater detail previously.33 
Briefly, trained research assistants studied families at home or other convenient 
locations. Demographic and medical data were assessed with 
the Children’s Sleep and Health Questionnaire (CSHQ), a pediatric 

Sleep-Disordered Breathing in Children—Rosen et al 


modification of a validated questionnaire (Health and Sleep Questionnaire, 
HSSQ).35 The CSHQ, completed by a parent, was generally used 
for children < 13 years of age. The HSSQ was generally used by children 
= 13 years of age who were able to self-complete it or able to complete 
it with some assistance from their parents. Although similarly 
structured, these questionnaires contained different items relevant for 
younger and older children, respectively. Height and weight were directly 
measured by research assistants to determine body-mass index (BMI). 

HRQOL was assessed with the CHQ-Parent Form (CHQ-PF50), a 
paper-and-pencil, parent-completed, generic quality of life instrument 
that has been designed for use with children 5 years of age and older.32 
US norms and preliminary benchmarks for some conditions such as 
asthma, ADHD, and cystic fibrosis are available. In addition, pediatric 
studies have been published using the CHQ in healthy children36 and in 
children with chronic health conditions (asthma,37,38 epilepsy,39 sickle 
cell disease,40 dialysis,41 and survivors of childhood cancer42). 

The instrument includes a broad spectrum of child- and family-
focused areas divided into 12 individual profiles that measure health-
related concepts within the child (ie, physical functioning, limitations in 
schoolwork and activities with friends due to physical health, general 
health, bodily pain, limitations in schoolwork and activities with friends 
due to behavior or emotional problems, self esteem, mental health, and 
general behavior) and the family (ie, limitations in family activities due 
to the child’s health and impact of child’s health on family cohesion) and 
measures the emotional impact of the child’s health on the caregiver 
respondent (eg, the degree he or she feels limited in personal time due to 
the child’s health and the level of emotional worry or concern due to the 
child’s health). All scales are multi-item except family cohesion, global 
behavior, and global general health. Scores for each of the concepts can 
be computed separately (CHQ profile scores) or combined to derive an 
overall physical score and a psychosocial score (CHQ summary scores). 
Descriptions of each individual scale and its interpretation are shown in 
the Appendix. 

For each item in a scale, parents rate an aspect of the child’s functioning 
on a 4-, 5-, or 6-point Likert scale to capture both the presence 
and extent of limitations during the previous 4 weeks with higher scores 
indicating better or more positive health status. For example, within the 
physical functioning scale, parents respond to items describing their 
child’s limitations in activities due to health problems (eg, doing things 
that take a lot of energy, such as playing soccer or running, walking one 
block, or climbing one flight of stairs) on a 4-point Likert scale ranging 
from “Yes, limited a lot” to “No, not limited.” Each multi-item scale 
score is calculated by totaling contributions from each item and then 
scaling the total score to provide values from 0 (representing worst 
health) to 100 (representing best health). The two summary measures, 
the Physical Health Summary and the Psychosocial Health Summary, 
are derived from weighted combinations of individual subscales and are 
quantified using T-scores with a mean of 50. Used in its entirety, the 
CHQ provides information on children’s social roles, emotional health, 
physical health, and family functioning (activities and cohesion). 

Variable Definitions 

Ethnicity of the child was reported on either the CSHQ or HSSQ with 
check-box responses that included choices: “White, Afro-American or 
Black, Hispanic, Asian/Oriental or Pacific Islander or Other.” Obesity 
was defined as a BMI greater than the 95th percentile for age and gender43. 
Asthma status was defined by “yes” responses to this condition 
from question 10.5.b in the CHQ-PF50: “Have you ever been told by a 
teacher, school official, doctor, nurse, or other health professional that 
your child has any of the following conditions (asthma)?” For children 
< 13 years of age , average sleep time was the numeric answer given by 
the parent to the following question: “How many hours on average does 
your child sleep on a week night?” For children = 13 years of age, average 
sleep time was derived by calculating the time difference between 
the responses to the following two questions: “During the past month, 
what time on average have you fallen asleep upon going to bed on week


days?” and “During the past month, what time on average have you awoken 
for good from your usual sleep?” Caregiver work status, education, 
and marital status were determined from the corresponding check-box 
responses to CHQ-PF50 questions 11.3, 11.5, and 11.6, respectively. 

Overnight in-home cardiorespiratory monitoring during sleep was 
performed with an Edentrace I or II monitor (Eden Prairie, MN) measuring 
nasal-oral thermistry, chest wall impedance, finger pulse oximetry, 
and heart rate as previously described44. From these overnight studies, 
respiratory events were defined as cessations (apneas) or discrete 
reductions (hypopneas) in airflow or chest impedance, lasting at least 10 
seconds and associated with at least a 2.5% fall in oxygen saturation. 
Estimated sleep time was identified when physiologic parameters were 
consistent with both sleep (eg, demonstrating little movement, reduced 
heart rate) and with sleep-wake times recorded on a sleep diary. The respiratory 
disturbance index (RDI) was determined by dividing the number 
of respiratory events by the estimated hours of sleep time. The RDI 
calculated from these measures has been shown previously to correlate 
excellently with that derived from full in-laboratory polysomnography.45 
The comparability of data derived using this definition to respiratory 
event definitions as described in the American Thoracic Society consensus 
statement of standards for cardiopulmonary sleep studies in children46 
was assessed in a subanalysis of 20 randomly chosen pediatric 
records (RDI 0 to 42) that were blindly rescored. In these records, the 
RDI included all obstructive (absent airflow with continued effort) 
apneas, regardless of desaturation, and hypopneas (reduced airflow, continued 
effort, and 4% desaturation). The correlation between the RDIs 
determined with these two approaches was excellent (Spearman’s r = 
.76, p<.0001), and reclassification of SDB status using specific cutoffs 
was minimal. These data support the overall comparability and accuracy 
of classification of SDB based on the RDI event definitions derived 
from the in-home clinical research methodologies as conducted in this 
study. 

For the regression analyses, SDB was categorized into four mutually 
exclusive clinical symptom groups, indicating increasing severity of 
SDB. These categories represent a spectrum of SDB symptoms and 
objective RDI findings commonly encountered in clinical practice but 
were not selected to indicate thresholds for diagnostic classification or 
treatment decisions. No Symptoms (NS) indicated no snoring or sleep-
related obstructive breathing symptoms and an RDI < 5 events per hour. 
Obstructive symptoms only (OS) indicated snoring, snorting, gasping or 
witnessed apnea more than once a week, but an RDI < 5 events per hour. 
Obstructive symptoms were defined by: 1) a report in the last month of 
snoring as loud as mumbling or talking or louder on the HSSQ or CHSQ 
or 2) a positive response to “snorting or gasping” or “breathing stops or 
he/she struggles to breathe” and these symptoms occurring at least 1 to 
2 times per week. Mild-moderate SDB (M-M SDB) indicated obstructive 
symptoms as above and RDI 5 to <10 events per hour. Moderate to 
severe SDB (M-S SDB) indicated obstructive symptoms and RDI = 10 
events per hour. 

The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of 
local hospitals (University Hospitals, the Louis Stokes Cleveland 
Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, and MetroHealth Medical 
Center) from which probands were recruited. 

Data Analysis 

The four levels of SDB indicating increasing severity (NS, OS, M-M 
SDB, M-S SDB) were the independent predictor variables. The CHQ 
summary scores (Physical and Psychosocial) and each of the CHQ scale 
scores were the dependent outcome variables. The relationships 
between the independent and dependent variables were adjusted for key 
covariates that intuitively might alter those relationships (age, sex, ethnicity, 
BMI, and asthma status). 

The CHQ scales were summarized as mean ± SD scores and median 
and interquartile ranges to reflect the fact that some distributions were 
highly skewed with prominent ceiling effects (Bodily Pain, Physical 
Functioning, Role Limitation-Physical, Role Limitation-

Health). Summary measures were compared across the four mutually 
exclusive categories of SDB. Bivariate comparisons of variables were 
made using the Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test for skewed variables 
and procedures that accounted for correlated family data (Proc Mixed), 
when normality could be approximated (Physical Health Summary, Psychosocial 
Summary, General Health, Mental Health, Self-Esteem, General 
Behavior). 

The CHQ outcomes were dichotomized into the bottom quintiles 
(20th percentile) for all scales except for five highly skewed subscales, 
where the lowest decile was used (Family Cohesion, Physical Functioning, 
Role-Emotional/Behavior, Global General Health, Global Behavior). 
The 20th percentile of observed responses corresponds closely to 
the parametric concept of one standard deviation below the mean, shown 
previously to indicate socially and clinically meaningful differences in 
the CHQ health status of children using the CHQ at a population level32 
and within a clinical sample.41 

Stepwise logistic regression was used to examine the relationship 
between the SDB strata and each CHQ outcome and to identify which of 
the potential covariates (sex, age, ethnicity, asthma, and BMI) to retain 
in the model. Covariates significant at P<0.25 entered and were 
retained. Hosmer and Lemeshow’s goodness of fit statistic was used to 
assess model quality. For the Bodily Pain scale, all covariates were 
included in the model to achieve an adequate fit by this statistic. Models 
selected from this stepwise regression procedure were then repeated 
using generalized estimated equations as implemented in PROC GENMOD 
in SAS to adjust for correlated family data.47 This analytic 
approach used a random effects model that accounted for clustering of 
data within families. Potentially outlying points were identified as 
observations with standardized Pearson residual values greater than 2. 
These were examined for plausibility as suggested by Stokes et al, however 
none were excluded.48 Associations between the SDB categories 
and CHQ outcomes were expressed as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence 
intervals (CI95%). Data were analyzed using SAS version 8.1 
(SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). 

RESULTS 

The characteristics of the 298 participants representing 132 different 
families are summarized in Table 1, categorized by the four levels of 
SDB. Index families were the recruitment source for the majority of the 
children (81%) with the remainder from neighborhood control families. 
Five (1.7 %) children were the original index cases in the CFS. The 

SLEEP, Vol. 25, No. 6, 2002 

sample included 54% females and 61% racial or ethnic minorities (57% 
African-American, 4% other or multiracial). The high proportions of 
participants recruited as family members of index families and African-
American participants reflects over-sampling of these subgroups to 
address the genetic-epidemiologic aims of the study. The high percentages 
of children with obesity or asthma reflect the association of SDB 
and obesity or lower respiratory tract problems, as previously reported in 
this cohort.44 At baseline, the M-S SDB group was more obese and 
included more minority children compared to the NS group. The OS 
group was also more obese and included more males compared to the NS 
group. 

Of the 5 index cases identified with a laboratory diagnosis of obstructive 
sleep apnea (OSA), 4 were in the M-S SDB group, and 1 was in the 
OS group, having been recruited after adenotonsillectomy. These 5 
index cases accounted for 21 family members (range, 1 to 8 additional 
individuals per family) less than 18 years old recruited into the study. Of 
these 21 individuals, 1 was in the OS group, 2 were in the M-M SDB 
group, 1 was in the M-S SDB group, with the remainder in the NS group. 

Table 2 reports the unadjusted summary measures for each of the 
CHQ scale scores. Highly skewed distributions indicate marked ceiling 
effects in many CHQ domains. A greater degree of SDB was associated 
significantly with lower scores for the Physical Health Summary score 
and for the General Health, Bodily Pain, Physical Functioning, Global 
General Health, and Parent Impact-Emotional. Effect sizes for these 
unadjusted measures were moderate to large (> 0.75-1.0 SD) for Physical 
Health Summary, Bodily Pain and Global General Health and small 
to moderate (> 0.5-0.75 SD) for Physical Functioning and Global General 
Health). 

Table 3 summarizes the results of the logistic regression analyses 
used to examine the relationship between SDB and HRQOL, adjusting 
for potential confounders (age, ethnicity, sex, asthma, and BMI) and for 
correlated family data. For the Physical Summary, both the M-S SDB 
group (OR = 2.74, 95%CI 1.09, 6.92; p = .032) and the M-M SDB group 
(OR = 3.82; 95%CI 1.31, 4.52; p = .014) were more likely than the NS 
group to have scores in the lowest quintile. For Bodily Pain, the M-S 
SDB group was 4.5 times more likely (OR = 4.57, 95%CI 1.45, 14.4; p 
= .010) than the NS group to have scores in the lowest quintile. Odds 
ratios exceeded 2.0 for General Health in each of the SDB categories and 
in the M-S SDB group for Physical Functioning. However, the confidence 
intervals were wide and point estimates overlapped one (p>.05). 
Asthma was a significant independent explanatory variable in the relationship 
between SDB and low CHQ scores for several scales: Physical 
Summary (OR = 2.08, 95%CI 1.01, 4.25; p = .044), Bodily Pain (OR = 
2.02, 95%CI 0.94, 4.35; p = .07), Physical Functioning (OR = 4.44,

DISCUSSION 

This is the first study to assess whether SDB was associated with 
decrements in HRQOL in a large, nonclinical (but enriched with individuals 
at increased risk for SDB) sample of children. Our data suggest 
that SDB is associated with reduced HRQOL in domains related to physical 
health outcomes, specifically for overall physical health status and 
for reports of bodily pain. These effects increased with more severe 
SDB and were sustained after adjusting for key covariates that might 
impact the relationship. 

Our unadjusted analyses suggested a “dose-response” relationship 
between severity of SDB and reductions in a broad range of HRQOL 
dimensions. Effects were largest in the Physical Health Summary and in 
the General Health, Bodily Pain, Physical Functioning, and Global General 
Health scale scores. In each of these domains, the mean and median 
scores were lower in the M-S SDB group than in a normative sample 
of children (see Appendix).32 Furthermore, the M-S SDB group’s mean 
scale score for Bodily Pain was lower than the mean reported for asthmatic 
children.32 Although several associations between SDB and 
reduced HRQOL disappeared after adjusting for covariates and correlated 
family data, significant relationships persisted for overall physical 
health status and bodily pain. Children with M-S SDB were 2.7 times 
more likely to have a reduced overall physical health status and 2.2 times 
more likely to report bodily pain. Children with M-M SDB were 3.8 
times more likely to have reduced overall physical health status. 

Our findings parallel recent studies suggesting that even mild SDB in 
children may be associated with daytime neurocognitive and behavioral 
dysfunction6-11 and extend these findings by showing measurable effects 
on generic indexes of physical health status. In contrast to the descriptions 
of neurocognitive and behavioral dysfunction in children with 
OSA, we did not identify differences in domains related to emotional or 
behavioral functioning in this sample, even in the children with evidence 
of M-S SDB findings. One explanation for our findings may be that 
SDB negatively impacts sleep quality that is important for promoting 
overall physical health. However, the relatively small proportion of children 
classified with SDB may have limited our ability to detect differences 
in the more psychosocial aspects of HRQOL. 

Increased reporting of “bodily pain” among children with SDB was 
a novel finding. Possible explanations include: 1) increased discomfort 
related to increased work of breathing or mouth breathing related to 
upper airway obstruction 2) morning headache pain following impaired 
gas exchange associated with SDB or 3) dysphagia related to enlarged 
tonsils often associated with childhood SDB. Alternatively, children 
with SDB and poor quality sleep may be more fatigued or irritable compared 
to children without SDB. This fatigue or heightened irritability 
may trigger more general somatization of symptoms. 

Our findings of reduced HRQOL related to physical symptoms in 
children with SDB are consistent with preliminary findings from other 
investigators. As part of validation studies for a new disease-specific 
HRQOL instrument for adenotonsillar disease in children, Stewart et al 
used a similar, but shorter, version of the CHQ in a subset of children 
referred to an otolaryngologist office for surgical management of adenotonsillar 
disease.28,31 They observed significant correlations between 
their Infection subscale and CHQ’s Bodily Pain subscale and between 
their Airway and Breathing subscale and the CHQ’s Physical Function-

ing subscale.31 Stradling et al previously reported morning headaches in 
children with OSA that improved after adenotonsillectomy.6 Our findings 
point to the importance of obtaining additional information concerning 
location, intensity, and frequency of pain in future studies to better 
characterize the impact of SDB on physical functioning and pain in 
children. 

The clinical sample described by Stewart et al was a very different 
group than our community-based nonclinical cohort.28 Nevertheless, 
they observed that CHQ mean scores were significantly lower on almost 
every scale compared to corresponding scores reported for healthy children. 
Many scores were even lower than those reported for children 
with asthma or juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. However, the authors 
acknowledged the limitations of their surgical referral sample and of not 
considering other co-morbidities in assessing their findings. Medical comorbidities 
can confound the relationship between SDB or adenotonsillar 
disease and health outcomes as demonstrated in our analyses. 

An important limitation of our study is the relatively small proportion 
of children affected by SDB (15% of the sample). In addition, the relatively 
mild degree of SDB may have limited our ability to better characterize 
the impact of severe SDB on HRQOL. Only 3% of our sample 
had an RDI = 15, the threshold value for moderate SDB used in the Sleep 
Heart Health study of the association of SDB and HRQOL in adults. 
More work is needed to assess the impact of SDB on functional outcomes 
in more severely affected children. 

Despite the advantage of using generic HRQOL instruments to compare 
outcomes across groups of children, generic HRQOL instruments 
may be less sensitive to specific health effects due to disease or to 
changes in children’s health status. Disease-specific instruments to 
assess the quality of life outcomes with sleep apnea21 or the impact of 
SDB-related excessive daytime sleep on quality of life19 have been 
developed for adults. Similar concerns among pediatric otolaryngologists 
have prompted the development of disease-specific quality of life 
instruments for either SDB or adenotonsillar disease in children.29-31,49 
Although these pediatric instruments were developed using convenience 
samples of clinically symptomatic children evaluated in tertiary academic 
otolaryngologic practices, the preliminary reports indicate that 
valid, reliable, responsive, and easily administered disease-specific 
instruments can be developed. Data from both general and disease-specific 
HRQOL instruments are needed to help guide investigators on 
strategies for the measurement of health outcomes in SDB in children. 
Finally, the CHQ used in this study relies on parent-proxy reports of 
quality of life. The incorporation of a child self-report would have 
strengthened the study. The child report version of the CHQ requires the 
intellectual capacity of at least a 10-year-old child,32 while the peak age 
of sleep apnea is between 3 to 6 years of age.3 Thus, the usefulness of 
child self-reports for assessment of HRQOL impact may be limited for 
childhood OSA. 

In summary, this study utilized data from an existing cohort to assess 
the association of SDB on generic HRQOL in children. Our findings 
confirm the important effects of age, gender, ethnicity, BMI and asthma 
on HRQOL. Moreover, a significant independent effect of SDB was 
identified on overall physical health status and complaints of bodily pain 
and persisted after adjustment for these key covariates in a sample of 
children that was primarily not clinical. Whether the relatively mild 
degree of SDB in this cohort is causally related to these effects requires 
further study. Our data highlight the importance of adjusting for key 
covariates that may explain a significant portion of the impact. More 
work is needed to assess the impact of SDB on functional outcomes in 
more-severely affected children.
