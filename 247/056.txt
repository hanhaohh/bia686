ABSTRACT 

Sleep breathing disorders (SBD) in children are reportedly underdiagnosed 
in general practice. A contributory factor may be parental underreporting 
of symptoms. This possibility was examined by comparing the frequency with which 
snoring was mentioned at general practitioner visits by parents with frequency 
that snoring was reported on questionnaire evaluation immediately prior to consultation. 
We also examined the effects of age and gender on SBD symptoms. 
Parents of 626 children aged 0 to 16 years attending their general practitioner for 
sick child visits completed selected items from the Sleep Disturbance Scale for 
Children and the Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome Expanded Childhood 
Questionnaire. Parents and general practitioners were also asked if snoring was 
discussed at the current consultation visit or at a prior consultation visit in the 
previous 12 months. Eighteen percent (112 of 626) of children were frequent 
snorers (more than three times per week), whereas 0.6 to 5.0% of children snored 
and had one or more additional SBD symptom suggestive of obstructive sleep 
apnea. SBD symptoms tended to peak in early to middle childhood with few 
gender differences. We found that snoring was patently underreported by parents. 
In the children with a history of frequent snoring on questionnaire evaluation 
and where the reason for the consultation visit was documented, snoring was 
mentioned by parents at the current consultation visit in only 8% (8 of 100) of 
cases and at a prior consultation visit in only 15% (15 of 100) of cases. The pres-

ent findings support a need for increased parental education regarding the symptoms 
and clinical significance of SBD. 

KEYWORDS: Snoring, sleep breathing disorders, children, general 
practitioners 

Sleep breathing disorders (SBD) range in 
severity from primary snoring to obstructive sleep 
apnea syndrome (OSAS). In children, OSAS is 
known to interfere with nocturnal ventilation and, 
if severe, results in cor pulmonale, systemic hypertension, 
and failure to thrive.1–6 In addition, both 
snoring and OSAS have been associated with cognitive-
behavioral deficits and poorer school performance.
2,3,7–14 It is estimated that 8 to 12% of children 
snore most nights,8,9,15–20 whereas nearly 1 to 
3% of children have OSAS.16,17,21 However, despite 
their clinical significance and relatively high prevalence 
rates, SBD in children are reported to be underdiagnosed 
in general practice.22–26 A possible 
contributory factor may be poor awareness among 
parents regarding the clinical significance of SBD 
and, hence, the underreporting of symptoms at consultation 
visits with general practitioners. This remains 
to be investigated. 

An additional issue that remains to be more 
fully examined is the effects of age, gender, and 
symptom frequency on the reporting of SBD symptoms 
in children. Apart from snoring, which is reported 
to decrease with age16,17,20 and possibly have 
a higher prevalence rate in males,16,27 little is known 
about the effects of age and gender on the reporting 
of other SBD symptoms such as gasping for 
breath, mouth breathing, witnessed apnea, watching 
the child because of fears about breathing, etc. 
In addition, although snoring is reported to decrease 
with age, it has generally been examined over 
limited age-ranges (e.g., 4 to 5,17 4.5 to 5.5,9 0.5 to 
6,16 5 to 6,20 5 to 7,28 6.5 to 7.5,8 0 to 10,19 3 to 
11,21 6 to 11,29 4 to 12,30 6 to 13,15 6 to 13,18 and 9 
to 15 years27) and there is a need to examine the effect 
of age more broadly from infancy to adoles


cence. A similar need exists for other SBD symptoms. 
Finally, although likely, it remains to be established 
whether the severity of symptoms predicts 
parental reporting of SBD symptoms at consultation 
visits with general practitioners. 

The aims of the present study were two-fold. 
The first aim was to examine in children aged 0 to 
16 years the correspondence between parental-
reporting on a questionnaire of a key SBD symptom, 
namely snoring, with the frequency that parents 
and general practitioners discuss snoring at 
consultation in symptomatic children. The second 
aim was to examine more broadly the effects of age, 
gender, and symptom frequency on parental reporting 
of SBD symptoms. 

METHODS 

Participants 

Parents of children aged 0 to 16 years awaiting consultation 
with their general practitioner were recruited 
by medical support staff over an 8-month period 
at five established (all operating for more than 
12 months) general medical practices in South Australia. 
We excluded any child who had not visited his 
or her general practitioner at least once in the previous 
12 months. All children were attending consultations 
for sick child visits. The frequency of visits over 
the previous 12 months was not collected. On the 
basis of noncompleted questionnaires, we estimate a 
> 90% response rate and, as estimated by clinic 
records, we surveyed 26.4% of the total number of 
child patients attending their general practitioner. 


REPORTING OF SBD IN CHILDREN/BLUNDEN ET AL 169 

Fifteen general practitioners participated in 
the postconsultation assessment of snoring. They 
were all employed in nonspecialist general community 
practice clinics that were established for more 
than 12 months and located in the same geographical 
location (Northern Division of Adelaide, South 
Australia) with comparable patient profiles. The general 
practitioners were all briefed about the study 
prior to its commencement. 

Apparatus and Procedure 

Prior to consultation with their child’s general practitioner, 
parents were asked to complete a demographic 
checklist. They then were asked to complete 
three items from the Sleep Disturbance Scale 
for Children (SDSC)31 (i.e., “Does your child snore?,” 
“Does your child have breathing difficulties at 
night?,” and “Does your child gasp for breath during 
sleep?” [1 = never, 2 = occasionally or 1 to 2 
times per month, 3 = sometimes or 1 to 2 times per 
week, 4 = often or 3 to 5 times per week, and 5 = always 
or every night]) and seven items from the Obstructive 
Sleep Apnea Syndrome Expanded Childhood 
Questionnaire (OSASECQ)32 (i.e., “If your 
child snores, how loud is the snoring?” [1 = nil, 2 = 
quiet, 3 = medium loud, 4 = loud, and 5 = extremely 
loud], “Is your child a daytime mouth breather?” [1 
= never, 2 = rarely, 3 = frequently, and 4 = constantly], 
and “During your child’s sleep do you ever: (a) see 
your child stop breathing, (b) see your child struggling 
to breathe, (c) need to shake him or her to 
start breathing again, (d) see your child’s lips or skin 
turn blue or purple, and (e) watch your child because 
you are afraid about his or her breathing?” 
[yes or no]). Parents were instructed to give the response 
that best represented their child over the 
last 12 months and when their child was not sick. 

Parents were also asked if they had sought 
medical advice in the previous 12 months because 
their child snored (yes; yes, more than once; and no) 
and if snoring was mentioned at consultation in the 
previous 12 months by their general practitioner 

(yes, no, and don’t know). In addition, they were 
asked to give the current reason at the time of completing 
the questionnaires for the child’s visit to the 
general practitioner (snoring, other sleep problem, 
and other medical problem). 

Immediately after the consultation visit, general 
practitioners completed a checklist that asked 
the current reason for the child’s visit (snoring, other 
sleep problem, and other medical problem) and if 
parents had discussed snoring in the last 12 months 
(yes, no, don’t know, and new patient). The general 
practitioners had access to case notes at the time 
the checklist was completed. 

The study was approved by the Human Ethics 
Committee of the University of South Australia. 

Statistical Analysis 

Where appropriate, either chi-square or two-way 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) analyses were undertaken 
with age and gender as independent variables 
and questionnaires responses as dependent 
variables. Statistical significance was set at 0.05. For 
the chi-square analyses, a Bonferroni correction was 
made for multiple comparisons. Significant main 
effects on ANOVA were examined using Games-
Howell post-hoc tests. Age was collapsed into 2year 
intervals for analyses. 

RESULTS 

From 668 questionnaires we excluded 16 containing 
two or more missing items (12 because age was not 
reported and 14 because they were new patients), 
leaving a total of 626. The sample contained 54.5% 
(n = 341) males and 45.5% (n = 285) females with 
55.4% (n = 347) in the preschool age group (0 to 6 
years). The mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of the 
cohort was 6.1 (4.4) years with no significant age difference 
between gender [t(624) = 0.18, not significant 
[ns]; female = 6.2 (4.4) and male = 6.0 (4.4) years].

Discussion of Snoring at Current 
Consultation Visit 

Parents reported that the reason for their child’s current 
consultation visit with their general practitioner 
was for snoring in 9 cases [4 female and 5 males; 
mean (SD) age = 5.6 (2.0) years; range = 2.8 to 10.1 
years], other sleep problems in 13 cases, and other 
medical problems in 581cases; no reason was given 
in 23 cases. Of the 9 children visiting their general 
practitioner for snoring, 7 were reported to snore 
every night, 1 often and 1 occasionally. General practitioners 
reported that 10 children visited for help 
at the current consultation for snoring [all males; 
age = 6.0 (2.5) years; range 2.8 to 10.4 years], 16 
visited for other sleep problems, and 559 visited for 
other medical reasons, whereas 41 provided no reason. 
In only 3 cases did both parents and general 
practitioners agree that the reason for the current 
consultation visit was snoring. 

Discussion of Snoring at Consultation 
Visits during the Previous 12 Months 

To examine the correspondence between parental 
and general practitioner reporting of snoring over 
the previous 12 months, we excluded those cases with 
missing responses (40 parents, 43 general practitioners, 
and 10 both) leaving a final total of 553. 
The percentage of parents and general practitioners 
in the subsample who discussed snoring at a consultation 
visit in the previous 12 months is summarized 
in Table 1. In this subsample, parental report 
indicated that 18.1% (100 of 553) of children snored 
often or always (i.e., frequently). In this salient subgroup 
of 100 children with a history of frequent 
snoring on questionnaire evaluation, 15% (15 of 553) 
of parents reported that they discussed snoring at 
consultation in the previous 12 months (7 indicated 
once and 8 indicated more than once) and 17% (17 
of 553) recalled that their general practitioner inquired 
about snoring in the previous 12 months. 
General practitioners recalled that 18% (18 of 553) 

parents raised concerns about snoring at a consultation 
visit in the previous 12 months. Examination 
of the correspondence between parents and general 
practitioners about whether snoring was discussed 
at a prior consultation visit over the previous 12 
months revealed agreement in 10 cases. 

Despite the relatively small number of parents 
that discussed snoring at consultation, a general 
trend was observed for snoring to be mentioned 
more often in children who snored more frequently 
on questionnaire evaluation (Table 1). Likewise, general 
practitioners were more likely to have discussed 
snoring at consultation over the previous 12 months 
in children with a history of frequent snoring on 
questionnaire evaluation (Table 1). 

SBD Symptoms: Age and Gender 

Parental responses to the dichotomous rated OSASECQ 
items for each age cohort are given in 
Table 2. In order of increasing magnitude, 0.6% of 
parents reported that they “needed to shake their 
child to start them breathing again,” 2.6% “witnessed 
their child stop breathing while sleeping,” 2.9% “witnessed 
their child’s lips or skin turn blue or purple,” 
10.3% “saw their child struggle to breathe,” and 
18.6% “watched their child during sleep because 
they were afraid about his or her breathing.” Chi-
square analyses (corrected for multiple comparisons 
p < 0.008) revealed a significant effect for age on 
“watching child’s breathing pattern during sleep” (2 
= 34.6; p < 0.0001), with parents reporting more 
watchfulness in children aged 0 to 6 years compared 
with 8 to 16 years. A nonsignificant trend was also 
found for child’s “lips or skin turning blue or purple” 
to decrease with age (2 = 17.8; p < 0.02). No 
significant effect of gender was observed on any dichotomous 
SBD symptoms (all p > 0.05). 

The frequency distribution of responses to 
the SDSC (snoring, nighttime breathing difficulty, 
and gasping for breath) and continuous OSASECQ 
(loudness of snoring and mouth breathing) SBD 
symptoms collapsed across age are given in Table 3.

The percentage of the children with SDSC and 
continuous OSASECQ responses in the high frequency 
range according to age cohort are given in 
Table 4. 

As detailed in Table 3, we found that 1.9% 
(12 of 626) of children gasped for breath often or

difficulties often or always, 5.3% (33 of 620) had 

loud or extremely loud snoring, 17.9% (112 of 626) 
snored often or always, and 23.1% (136 of 589) had 
frequent or constant mouth breathing. Examination 
of the frequency responses given in Table 4 suggests 
a trend for the SDSC and continuous OSASECQ 
SBD symptoms to be reported more often in early-
middle childhood. ANOVA confirmed a significant

[F(7, 604) = 5.5; p < 0.0001], daytime mouth breathing 
[F(7, 573) = 2.7; p < 0.05], and frequency of 
snoring [F(7, 610) = 3.9; p < 0.0005]. Post-hoc 
analyses indicated that snoring was significantly 
more frequent in children aged 4 to 8 years compared 
with 0 to 2 years and louder in children aged 
2 to 8 years compared with 0 to 2 years, whereas 
mouth breathing was more frequent in children 
aged 6 to 8 years compared with 0 to 2 years (all p 
< 0.05). A significant main effect was observed for 
gender on loudness of snoring [F(1, 604) = 6.0; p 
< 0.05; mean (SD) male = 2.1 (0.8) > female = 2.0 
(0.8)] and daytime mouth breathing [F(1, 573) = 
4.2; p < 0.05; male = 2.0 (0.9) > female = 1.8 (0.8)]. 
No other significant main or age by gender interaction 
effects were observed. 

Estimate of OSAS Frequency 

To obtain an approximate prevalence estimate of 
OSAS, we tabulated the number of children that 
were frequent (often or always) snorers and had 
one other SBD symptom in the severe range. This 
cross-tabulation revealed that 0.5% (3 of 617) of 
children snored frequently and needed to be shaken 

to start breathing again, 0.6% (4 of 617) snored frequently 
and had lips or skin turn purple, 0.6% (4 of 
626) snored frequently and always gasped for breath 
during sleep, 0.8% (5 of 620) snored frequently and 
extremely loudly, 0.8% (5 of 624) snored frequently 
and often had nighttime breathing difficulties, 1.0% 
(6 of 619) snored frequently and parents had witnessed 
breath holding, 2.7% (16 of 589) snored frequently 
and had constant daytime mouth breathing, 
4.2% (26 of 619) snored frequently and were 
observed to struggle with breathing, and 5.0% (31 
of 618) snored frequently and were watched during 
sleep by parents because of fears about their 
breathing. 

DISCUSSION 

This study addresses the important issue of how 
often childhood snoring is discussed between parents 
and general practitioners during a consultation 
visit in a large community sample of convenience. 
We found that snoring was not discussed at consultation 
over the previous 12 months in approximately 
80% of symptomatic children with a history 


174 SLEEP AND BREATHING/VOLUME 7, NUMBER 4 2003 

of frequent snoring (i.e., more than three times a 
week) on questionnaire evaluation. It is also noteworthy 
that only 8 of the 112 children with a history 
of frequent snoring on questionnaire evaluation were 
currently visiting their general practitioners because 
of parental concerns about snoring. Although the 
magnitude of the rate of parental underreporting 
may be explained, in part, by problems with recall 
and a range of rater biases,33 a major contributory 
factor may be the general lack of awareness in the 
community about the clinical significance of SBD, 
with parents being unlikely to discuss sleep symptoms 
in general22,23,28,30 and snoring in particular.
25,34,35 Despite the weak trend for snoring to be 
mentioned more often at consultation in children 
who snored more frequently on questionnaire evaluation, 
the present findings suggest that parents are 
not sensitive to the importance of reporting snoring 
and other SBD symptoms at consultation. Taken 
together, the present findings indicate an increased 
need for education within the general community 
about the symptoms and clinical significance of SBD 
in children. 

General practitioners are also reported to 
underreport SBD symptoms at consultation. Chervin 
et al22 report that snoring was only documented in 
11 of 100 children identified by sleep questionnaire 
to be at risk of SBD. As has been suggested by 
three recent studies in the United States, there is 
also an increased need for greater awareness about 
pediatric sleep problems in clinical practice23 and 
an increased need for education on sleep in medical 
curricula.36,37 

The importance of timely recognition of snoring 
in children lies in its potential to indicate OSAS. 
The true prevalence of OSAS cannot be determined 
without physiologic measures such as polysomnography 
(PSG).38 Despite this caveat, however, 
the SBD symptoms selected in the present study 
are reported to be potential indicators of OSAS.32,38 
On the basis of the criteria of frequent snoring and 
a history of one or more SBD symptoms in the severe 
range, we estimate that 0.6 to 5.0% of the children 
in the present study had symptoms suggestive 
of OSAS. This is comparable to previous preva


lence estimates of OSAS that were based on polysomnography 
measurement (e.g., 0.7,18 0.7,9 0.7,29 
0.8,21 2.9,16 and 2.9%17). 

The potential sequelae of OSAS, if unrecognized, 
are wide ranging and include cor pulmonale, 
developmental delay, failure to thrive, and systemic 
hypertension.1–6 There is, in some quarters, a clinical 
view that if the snoring child does not present 
with severe OSAS, then the likelihood of clinically 
significant morbidity is rare. This view is now being 
challenged by several recent studies that suggest 
that milder degrees of SBD also result in daytime 
sequelae, including impaired attention, memory, intelligence, 
learning, and school performance, and increased 
problematic behavior,8,10,12 whereas primary 
snoring has recently been shown to affect vascular 
reactivity.39 Given this evidence, it is of considerable 
clinical significance that potentially up to 80% of 
symptomatic children in this study remained undiagnosed. 
This is of particular consequence because 
treatment of SBD in children is reported to reverse 
decrements in daytime performance.8,10,12,40 

In this survey of children attending their general 
practitioner, we found that 17.9% (112 of 626) 
of children snored often or always. Although differences 
in duration criteria and sample characteristics 
make comparisons difficult, the present estimate is 
broadly comparable to those obtained from previous 
general practice surveys.19,26,30 Owen et al19 examined 
snoring frequency in 245 children attending 
a large general practice surgery and found that 
16% of children snored “sometimes,” whereas an 
additional 11% snored “often.” Similarly, Archbold 
et al26 reported in 1038 children visiting their general 
practitioner that 17% of snored more than half 
the time. Stein et al30 found in their sample of 472 
children attending a general pediatric clinic that 
11% snored more than once per week and 12% snored 
more than seven times per week. The present estimate 
of “frequent” snoring, however, is higher than 
comparable estimates obtained from general community 
surveys (e.g., 3.2,16 6.2,17 5.1,32 7.3,15 7.7,28 
8.5,18 10.0,20 11.4,8 and 12.1%9), thus suggesting that 
children visiting their general practitioner are more 
likely to report snoring. 


REPORTING OF SBD IN CHILDREN/BLUNDEN ET AL 175 

In addition to identifying the frequency of 
snoring, the present study permits a cross-sectional 
evaluation and, therefore, a better understanding of 
the natural history of snoring. In general, we found 
that snoring is more common during early to middle 
childhood. Owen et al19 report similar findings 
in a sample of children visiting their general practitioner, 
with snoring showing a peak in 4 to 8 years. 
It is of note in the present study that although snoring 
showed an age-related decline, it was still relatively 
common in older children, with parental report 
indicating that 10.7% of children aged 10 to 
16 years snored more than three times per week. 
Similar to results found for snoring, the other SBD 
symptoms also tended to peak in early to middle 
childhood, especially snoring loudness and mouth 
breathing. 

The present study also explored the effect of 
gender on SBD symptoms. We found that males 
had significantly louder snoring and more mouth 
breathing. Three previous studies have found an 
overrepresentation of snoring in male children and 
adolescents,16,27,41 but most report no gender difference.
8,9,15,17,18,29,30 Only one group has re-evaluated 
children with SBD later in life and that study suggests 
that male children may be at increased risk of 
recurrence during adulthood.42 Indeed, in adults there 
is a significant overrepresentation of males with 
SBD.43 It remains unclear, however, if snoring boys 
will progress to OSAS later in life. 

The present study is limited by the use of a 
sample of convenience and parental recall as the 
method of data gathering. It was also reliant on parents’ 
perception of snoring and other SBD symptoms, 
which were not independently validated and 
thus are susceptible to rater bias.33 In addition, because 
the number of child visits was not collected, 
we are unable to determine to what extent this may 
have influenced parental and general practitioner 
recall. It is possible, for example, that the higher recall 
of snoring and SBD symptoms in younger children 
may be explained by the tendency for younger 
children to visit their general practitioner more often. 
It is also possible that we may have underestimated 
the reporting of snoring by general practitioners 

because consultations were for sick child visits, during 
which chronic problems are less likely to be inquired 
about in a busy practice compared with well 
child visits, during which chronic problems, such as 
snoring, are more likely to be discussed. Finally, it 
remains possible that although snoring may have 
been discussed on prior visits, it may not have been 
documented in the case notes. As such, we may 
have underestimated the frequency of recall by general 
practitioners. 

Despite the limitations identified above, we 
believe that by using multiple measures of SBD 
within a broad age range, the present study allows 
for a clearer picture of the frequency and severity of 
snoring and other SBD symptoms in children. The 
important finding of the present study, however, is 
that the majority of children with a history of frequent 
snoring on questionnaire evaluation did not 
come to the attention of their general practitioner. 
This suggests that many clinical opportunities to 
diagnose and treat children with SBD are being 
missed. The need for increased awareness of snoring 
and other symptoms of SBD is clear.
