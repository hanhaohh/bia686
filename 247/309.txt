Study Objectives: The pattern and distribution of rapid eye movement 
(REM) sleep changes during development, yet there have been few studies 
of REM density in children. Although children with obstructive apnea 
syndrome (OSAS) obstruct primarily during REM sleep, the relationship 
between REM density and obstructive apnea has not been established 
for this population. We hypothesized that (i) REM density and REM cycle 
duration increases over the course of the night in children, (ii) the duty cycle 
(inspiratory time divided by respiratory cycle time) increases over the 
course of the night in children with suspected OSAS, and (iii) the increase 
in REM density over the course of the night is associated with increased 
severity of obstructive apnea. 
Design: REM density and respiratory parameters were measured during 
polysomnography. 
Setting: Sleep laboratory 

Patients: 76 children with suspected OSAS. 
Interventions: NA 
Measurements and Results: REM density and the duration of REM 
cycles increased over the course of the night until the fifth REM cycle, and 
then stabilized. The duty cycle increased across the first 6 REM cycles. 
However, the apnea hypopnea index (AHI) did not increase across REM 
cycles, and was not affected by the changes in REM density or duty cycle. 
We speculate that the increase in the duty cycle is a compensatory response 
to increased upper airway loads during sleep, and that this may 
lead to ventilatory or upper airway muscle fatigue.

children, who have more REM than older children. The upper age 
limit was used to exclude most children in the later stages of puberty, 
as sex hormones can affect OSAS.10,11 The suspicion of OSAS 
was based on a presenting complaint of habitual snoring associated 
with additional symptoms, such as labored breathing during sleep 
or excessive daytime sleepiness. Children with significant, chronic 
medical conditions other than suspected OSAS secondary to adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy or obesity were excluded, except for those 
with mild asthma requiring only intermittent albuterol therapy. 
Thus, children with genetic syndromes, craniofacial anomalies and 
neurologic disease were excluded. Children with a history of previous 
upper airway surgery or previous treatment for OSAS, those on 
medications known to affect REM sleep, and those with a history of 
blindness or serious injury to one or both eyes, were also excluded. 
Subjects were considered obese if their body mass index was greater 
than the 95th percentile for age, height, and race.12 

Written informed consent was obtained from the parents/legal 
guardians. In addition, assent was obtained from children =7 years 
of age. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board 
of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and studies were performed 
according to the Declaration of Helsinki. 

Polysomnography 

Overnight polysomnography commenced between 20:00-21:00 
and ended at 06:00. The following parameters were recorded (using 
Rembrandt, Medcare, Buffalo, NY): electroencephalogram (C3/ 
A2, C4/A1, O1/A2, O2/A1); submental electromyogram (EMG); 
tibial EMG; electrocardiogram; chest and abdominal wall motion 
by respiratory inductance plethysmography (Respitrace Systems, 
Ambulatory Monitoring Inc, Ardsley, NY); airflow by nasal pressure 
(Pro-Tech Services, Inc, Mukilteo, WA) and 3-pronged thermistor 
(Pro-Tech Services, Inc, Mukilteo, WA); end-tidal PCO2 by 
capnography (Novametrix 7000; Novametrix, Wallingford, CT); 
arterial oxygen saturation (Novametrix 7000 or Masimo, Irvine, 
CA), oximeter pulse waveform, and digital video. 

Four electrooculographic (EOG) gold cup electrodes (Grass, 
West Warwick, RI) were placed to detect eye movements. Right 
and left EOG leads were placed 1 cm lateral to the outer can-
thus of each eye, in the horizontal plane. Vertical EOG leads were 
placed 1 cm above and below the right eye.13,14 All 4 leads were 
used to assess eye movements. EOG changes were scored as eye 
movements if they met the following criteria: amplitude >25 µV, 
velocity >500/sec, deflection >30, and at least200 ms between each 
eye movement.15 

Sleep architecture and arousals from sleep were analyzed using 
standard techniques.16,17 Respiratory parameters were scored 
using standard pediatric criteria,18,19 i.e., obstructive apneas of any 
length were scored. Hypopneas were scored if there was a qualitative 
decrease in oronasal airflow >50% associated with paradoxical 
respiratory efforts, desaturation >3%,20 and/or arousal. The 
obstructive apnea hypopnea index was defined as the number of 
obstructive apneas, mixed apneas, and obstructive hypopneas per 
unit time. Central apneas were also scored,18 but as very few central 
apneas occurred, these data are not presented. 

Data Analysis 

REM was divided into 1-second mini-epochs. The number of 
eye movements in each mini-epoch and the number of obstructive 

apneas originating within that epoch were manually calculated, 
as described in the literature.13 REM density was defined as the 
number of eye movements per each 30-second epoch of REM 
sleep. REM cycles of <2 minutes duration were not included in 
the analysis. For the purpose of analysis, REM cycles interrupted 
by <5 minutes of wakefulness or NREM sleep were considered to 
be part of the same REM cycle. Subjects with fewer than 3 REM 
cycles during the night were excluded. The obstructive apnea duration 
was defined as the sum of the duration of all obstructive apneas 
and hypopneas during each REM cycle. The inspiratory time and 
total respiratory cycle duration were obtained from the respiratory 
inductance plethysmographic signal. TI and TT were measured for 
each breath during the first and last minute of each REM cycle. 

Statistical Analysis 

The number of apneas and hypopneas in the first third of the 
night compared to the last third of the night was compared using 
the Wilcoxon signed rank test. The difference in REM density 
(averaged across all REM cycles) between subjects with an 
AHI <1/hr and those with an AHI >1 /hr was performed using 
the Mann-Whitney rank sum test. The Spearman correlation coefficient 
was used for correlational analyses. The effect of REM 
cycle on the various outcomes as measured repeatedly across 
REM cycles was analyzed based on a longitudinal mixed effects 
approach. In order to allow for the possibility that change across 
REM cycles has a curvilinear component, terms for quadratic 
time and cubic time were included in each model. If these terms 
were found to be nonsignificant, they were subsequently dropped 
from the final models. In order to explore the study hypotheses, 
various models involving time-varying or time-dependent covariates 
were also examined. For example, the effect of REM density 
changing across REM cycle on AHI changing across REM cycle 
was examined by including REM density as a time-dependent 
covariate and specifying the repeating measures of AHI as the 
outcome variable. In this study, using several measurements from 
different REM cycles across the night, the compound symmetry 
covariance matrix structure was assumed. SAS Proc Mixed models 
were used.21 

RESULTS 

Study Group 

Seventy-nine subjects were studied. Three subjects were excluded 
as they had <3 REM cycles during the night. Thus, data 
were evaluated for 76 subjects. The mean age was 6 + 3 (SD) 
years, range 2-12 years. Fifty-six percent were female, and 29% 
were obese. Polysomnography results are shown in Table 1. Subjects 
had a wide range of severity of OSAS, as shown in Figure 1. 
AHI ranged from 0-57/hr, with a median AHI of 1.9/hr. 

REM Architecture 

With the exception of the 3 subjects excluded from the study 
because they had <3 REM cycles, subjects had 3-8 REM cycles 
during the night; 5 (7%) subjects had 7 REM cycles, and only 1 
(1%) subject had 8 cycles. REM density changed significantly 
across the REM cycles, with significant linear and quadratic time 
effects (P = 0.0017 and 0.0245, respectively), indicating a lin-

ear increase and an eventual leveling of REM density by the fifth 
REM cycle (Figure 2). 

There was no correlation between REM density (computed as 
the mean REM density per subject) and age (r = 0.11, P = 0.37; 
Figure 3). In order to compare this study to previous data in the 
literature, the correlation between REM density and age was reevaluated 
in those children > 6 years of age. There was a slightly 
stronger relationship, but this still did not reach significance (r = 
0.29, P = 0.11). There was no significant difference in mean REM 
density between children with an AHI <1/hr and children with an 
AHI >1/hr (P = 0.83). 

REM duration changed across the REM cycles, with significant 
linear and quadratic time effects (P <0.0001 for both linear and 
quadratic time effects), again indicating a linear increase and an 
eventual leveling at the fifth cycle (Figure 4). 

Duty Cycle 

TI/TT increased significantly across the REM cycles of the night 
in a linear fashion (P = 0.0033). This is shown in Figure 5. Note 
that very few subjects had more than 6 REM cycles; thus, the apparent 
decrease in TI/TT in cycles 7 and 8 was not significant.

Apnea Hypopnea Index 

The AHI and obstructive apnea duration variables were severely 
skewed, with a preponderance of values of zero, and could not 
be normalized using transformation techniques. Despite the fact 
that the number of REM obstructive apneas and hypopneas was 
greater during the last third of the night than the first third (first 
third, median 0, interquartile range 0-2; last third median 1, interquartile 
range 0–6.5; P <0.001), there was no significant change 
in the AHI across the REM cycles of the night (P = 0.052 for raw 
AHI and P = 0.45 for log AHI; Figure 6); nor was there a change 
in total obstructive apnea duration across the REM cycles of the 
night (P = 0.13 for raw values and P = 0.33 for log transformed 
values). 

The change in AHI across REM cycles was reevaluated for 
those subjects who had any degree of airway obstruction, i.e., af-

ter excluding those with an AHI = 0. Under these circumstances, 
log transformation helped to normalize the AHI distribution. There

0.12 for log values). Similarly, when only children with moderate 
OSAS (AHI >5/hr) were evaluated, there was no statistically significant 
change in AHI across REM cycles (P = 0.17 for raw values; 
P = 0.24 for log values). There were 2 subjects who were outliers, 
with very severe OSAS. One subject with an AHI of 42/hr had 4 
REM cycles; her REM AHI for each cycle, respectively, was 131, 
120, 77, and 107/hr. The second outlier, with an AHI of 57/hr, had 
3 REM cycles, with a REM AHI of 14, 122, and 32/hr, respectively. 
Thus, neither of the most severely affected subjects had a pattern of 
worsening during the last REM cycle. 
The correlations between AHI and REM density, and AHI and 
REM duration, were not significant (r = -0.05, P = -0.69; and r = 
-0.03, P = 0.80; respectively).

ing across REM cycles. There was no relationship between the 
changes in either REM density or TI/TT and changes in the AHI 
across REM cycles. 

Obesity 

There were no significant correlations between body mass index 
z-scores, which serve as an index of obesity, and AHI (P = 
0.19), mean REM density (P = 0.60), or mean TI/TT (P = 0.23) 
(all parameters computed as the average of the means for each 
REM cycle). 

DISCUSSION 

This study has shown that REM density and the duration of 
REM cycles changed over the course of the night in children, 
with an increase until the fifth REM cycle and then a plateau. 
The TI/TT increased across REM cycles. However, in contrast to 
our initial hypothesis, neither the change in REM density nor the 
change in TI/TT affected the AHI. 

Changes in REM Sleep with Age 

We have shown that both REM duration and REM density 
increase over the course of the night in preschool-aged children 
and school-aged children. REM sleep distribution is known to 
change with age and development. Newborns have a predominance 
of active sleep, a state analogous to REM sleep, and frequently 
enter sleep through this stage.22 The proportion of REM 
then decreases during childhood, and continues to decrease further 
during adulthood and old age.2 Although REM density has 
been shown to increase over the course of the night in adults,3,14 
REM density has not been well studied in children. Coble et al23 
evaluated REM density, for the first 4 cycles of the night only, 
in a somewhat older group of children (6-16 years). They found 
that REM density tended to increase over the first 4 REM cycles 
of the night. Our study confirmed this finding in younger children 
and showed a highly significant increase in REM density 
across all REM cycles. Coble et al also noted a trend towards

increased REM density in younger children, although this was 
only significant for the first and third REM cycles. Hoffman et 
al24 evaluated REM density in a small sample of females which 
included 2 prepubertal and 6 pubertal adolescents, and noted 
increased REM density in the prepubertal compared to the pubertal 
subjects. We found no relationship between age and REM 
density when evaluating a younger group of children, although 
there was a slight trend towards an increased REM density in 
younger children when only school-aged children were evaluated. 
Thus, in young children, there is no correlation between 
REM density and age. 

The subjects in the current study had sleep architecture similar 
to that of a large, somewhat younger, normal population recently 
reported by Montgomery-Downs et al,25 with a similar total sleep 
time (459 minutes in the current study compared to 472-475 minutes 
in the Montgomery-Downs study), a similar percentage of 
REM sleep (20% in the current study compared to 20%-21% in 
the Montgomery-Downs study), and a similar number of REM 
cycles. This is not surprising, as many studies have shown no difference 
in sleep architecture between children with OSAS and 
normal controls,5 or children with OSAS before and after treatment.
26,27 The duration of REM cycles across the night increased 
in the current study, similar to that reported by Montgomery-
Downs. However, the Montgomery-Downs study did not evaluate 
REM density. 

Apnea Hypopnea Index 

A previous study showed an increase in the REM AHI in the 
last third of the night compared with the first third of the night.5 
In that study, the night was arbitrarily divided into thirds, and 
only the first and last thirds of the night were evaluated, i.e., there 
was no evaluation of the intervening third. In contrast, the current 
study used sophisticated analytic techniques to evaluate the 
entire night. Although the current study found that the number of 
REM obstructions was greater during the last third of the night 
compared to the first third, when the intervening REM cycles 

were taken into account, the AHI did not change significantly 
across REM cycles. It is most likely that the difference between 
the 2 studies is due to the different analytic techniques used. 
Alternatively, the difference may be secondary to the inclusion 
of subjects with a wide distribution of AHI, as compared with 
the previous study, which evaluated subjects with more severe 
disease. However, this is less likely, as the results were similar 
when only subjects with an AHI >5/hr were studied. In addition, 
neither of the 2 subjects with very severe OSAS had their highest 
REM AHI during the last REM cycle. The variability in their 
patterns of AHI illustrates the importance of examining all REM 
cycles during the night. 

Duty Cycle 

The duty cycle (TI/TT) increased significantly across REM cycles. 
All of the subjects in this study presented with symptoms of 
OSAS and a history of habitual nightly snoring. Thus, all of the 
subjects had varying degrees of increased inspiratory resistance 
loading during sleep, ranging from snoring alone to obstructive 
sleep apnea.28 A prolonged TI has been shown to occur as a compensatory 
response to increased inspiratory resistance loading. 
This response has been shown to occur during both REM and 
NREM sleep,29,30 although the response during sleep is less than 
during wakefulness. Little is known about the relative contributions 
of upper airway and ventilatory pump muscles to breathing 
during sleep in children. In adults during wakefulness, it 
was recently suggested that the forces generated by these 2 sets 
of muscles are linearly related,31 but this may not apply during 
sleep. The TI/TT ratio probably represents the combined action 
of both upper airway muscles and ventilatory pump muscles. It 
is possible that inspiratory muscle (upper airway and pump) tone 
decreases as the night progresses, resulting in increased upper airway 
resistance. This can lead to a compensatory increase in TI/TT. 
In support of this theory, we have previously shown that normal 
children have a dramatic decrease in tidal volume in response to 
inspiratory resistance loading during sleep, accompanied by an 
increase in TI/TT.30 In contrast to adults,32 children manifest little 
recovery over time.30 

An increased TI/TT may lead to ventilatory muscle fatigue.9 
This could occur from continued work against an inspiratory 
load. Although previous studies (in adults) did not find evidence 
of diaphragmatic fatigue during sleep in patients with OSAS, 
these studies were all limited to NREM sleep.33,34 Furthermore, 
no studies have evaluated the upper airway muscles for fatigue 
over time. However, in the current study, the increased TI/TT 
across REM cycles was not associated with an increase in AHI, 
even in the more severely affected subjects, suggesting that clinically 
relevant muscle fatigue did not occur. It is possible that the 
increase in TI/TT across REM cycles was due to REM-related 
changes in upper airway neuromotor control or central regulation 
of ventilation. The latter appears unlikely. Animal studies using 
the carbachol model for REM sleep have shown a decrease 
in both inspiratory and expiratory time in response to carbachol 
injection,35 whereas studies in normal adults without sleep disordered 
breathing showed a decrease in expiratory time and TT in 
relation to REM density, but little change in TI.36 These studies are 
in contrast to the present study, which demonstrated an increase 
in TI

Limitations 


It should be noted that polysomnograms were terminated at 
06:00, due to laboratory scheduling issues. It is likely that some 
children would have had more REM cycles if they had been allowed 
to sleep until spontaneous awakening. However, total sleep 
time, proportion of REM time, and the number of REM cycles 
were similar to those previously reported for a large cohort of 
normal children,25 so it is unlikely that this had a major impact on 
our results. 

Children with OSAS may have a pattern of persistent partial 
upper airway obstruction associated with hypercapnia, rather then 
discrete obstructive events. This has been termed obstructive hypoventilation.
18 We did not analyze the relationship between hypercapnia 
and REM density, as this would have required analyzing 
the end-tidal PCO2 on a breath-by-breath basis. Future studies 
of this relationship would be of interest. 

Conclusions 


In conclusion, we have shown that REM density and the duty 
cycle (TI/TT) increase across REM cycles during the night in 
children. Despite this, the degree of obstructive apnea does not 
change significantly across REM cycles.
