Objective 
The goal of this study was to examine the relationship between quality of life (QOL) 
and symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) as well as objectively measured severity of OSA 
using polysomnography (PSG) in a cohort of overweight and at risk for overweight children and 
adolescents. Methods 
One hundred and fifty-one overweight subjects [90 males, average ages of 12.52, 
mean body mass index (BMI) Z-score of 2.27) and their parent/guardian completed surveys assessing 
QOL and symptoms of OSA syndrome. The subjects also underwent overnight PSG. Results 
Overweight 
patients reported poor QOL. Polysomnographic variables did not correlate with QOL. However, symptoms 
of OSA as reported on the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire significantly correlated with QOL from both the 
parent and the subject. Conclusions 
Overweight youth with symptoms of OSA have a lower QOL both by 
their report and parental report. Interestingly, objective measures of OSA did not correlate with QOL.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a syndrome of repetitive 
closure of the airway during sleep resulting in 
sleep disturbance, cyclic oxyhemoglobin desaturation, 
and frequently sustained hypercapnea (Ali, Pitson, & 
Stradling, 1993; Gislason & Benediktsdottir, 1995). OSA 
is a common medical problem in children with a 
prevalence rate of 2% in the general pediatric population 
(Redline el al., 1999; Rosen et al., 2003) and is 
associated with significant cardiopulmonary (Young, 
Pepperd, & Gottlieb, 2002) and neurobehavioral 
(Lipton & Gozal, 2003) sequelae. Furthermore, children 
with sleep apnea consume a disproportionate amount of 
health care dollars (Reuveni, Simon, Tal, Elhayany, & 
Tarasiuk, 2002). While snoring is a primary symptom of 
OSA, clinical history and physical examination alone are 
poor at distinguishing primary snoring from true 
obstructive sleep apnea (Carroll, McColley, Marcus, 
Curtis, & Loughlin, 1995; Lam, et al., 2006; O’Brien 
& Gozal, 2002; Xu, Chuek, & Lee, 2006). Thus, 
polysomnography (PSG) is commonly used to establish 

the presence of and quantify severity of OSA (American 
Academy of Pediatrics, 2002). Obese children are at 
increased risk of OSA with reported prevalence rates of 
26–46% (Ali et al., 1993; Brouilette et al., 1984; Marcus 
et al., 1996; Wing et al., 2003). Obesity has reached 
epidemic proportions in the United States with 15.3% of 
children and 15.5% of adolescents now classified as 
overweight [body mass index (BMI) 95%ile] (Slyper, 
2004). Obesity-associated OSA is likely to affect a 
growing number of children as the prevalence of 
childhood obesity increases (Miller, Rosenbloom, & 
Silverstein, 2004). 

The impact of chronic medical conditions on affected 
individuals is typically assessed using health-related quality 
of life (QOL) questionnaires in which subjects and 
their families report a subjective perception of their physical 
and emotional functioning as it relates to their disease 
and treatment. Multiple published studies demonstrate 
that reported QOL is quite poor for overweight youth 
(de Beer et al., 2007; Fallon et al, 2005; Hughes, Farewell,

Harris, & Reilly, 2007; Schwimmer, Burwinkle, & Varni, 
2003; Swallen, Reither, Haas, & Meier, 2005; Tyler, 
Johnston, Fullerton, & Foreyt, 2007; Zeller & Modi, 
2006) and is likewise poor for those with OSA (Crabtree, 
Varni, & Gozal, 2004; Mitchell & Kelly, 2004; Rosen, 
Palermo, Larkin, & Redline, 2002; Stewart, Glaze, 
Friedman, Smith, & Bautista, 2005; Tran, Nguyen, 
Weedon, & Goldstein, 2005) mirroring the decrement in 
QOL reported for children with cancer (Schwimmer et al., 
2003) and rheumatologic diseases (Sawyer et al., 2004). 
Published literature demonstrates that obese children and 
adolescents have difficulties with physical function and 
physical health (Friedlander, Larkin, Rosen, Palermo, & 
Redline, 2003; Swallen et al., 2005), psychosocial function 
(Wake, Salman, Waters, Wright, & Hesketh, 2002; 
Friedlander et al., 2003), emotional (Schwimmer et al., 
2003) and social (Pinhas-Hamiel et al., 2006; Schwimmer 
et al., 2003; Williams, Wake, Hesketh, Maher, & Waters, 
2005) function, mental health (Wake, Salman, Waters, 
Wright, & Hesketh, 2002), self-esteem (Friedlander et al., 
2003), and overall health (Swallen et al., 2005). 
Furthermore, self-reported health-related quality of life is 
inversely related to BMI and is only partially explained by 
obesity-related comorbidities (deBeer et al., 2007). 

The increasing prevalence of childhood obesity 
predicts an increasing prevalence of both physical 
health risks associated with being overweight as well as 
psychological distress associated with obesity. There is a 
growing awareness in the medical community about the 
long-term health consequences of childhood obesity, yet 
the most prevalent complications of childhood obesity 
may be psychological rather than physical. Overweight 
youth are more likely to report hopelessness, consider 
themselves a poor student, attempt suicide, and less 
likely to spend free time with friends (Falkner et al., 
2001). Overweight children are taller than normal weight 
peers and progress through puberty at a younger age 
(Wang, 2002). Thus, they frequently appear older than 
their chronologic age, resulting in unrealistically high 
expectations being placed. When these expectations 
are not met, children may become discouraged and 
develop a negative self-image. Children with OSA 
frequently struggle academically (Gozal, 1998) and have 
poor executive functioning (O’Brien et al., 2003), further 
compounding the image of the overweight child with 
OSA as socially inept, academically challenged, and 
physically unfit. 

The goal of this study was to examine the relationship 
between parent and self-reported QOL and symptoms 
of OSA as well as objectively measured severity of 

OSA using nocturnal PSG (NPSG) in a cohort of 
overweight and at risk for overweight children and 
adolescents. We hypothesized that both symptomatic 
severity as well as polysomnographic severity of OSA 
would predict decrements in QOL. The secondary aim of 
this study was to examine the relationship between 
parent and self-reported QOL and severity of obesity 
as measured by body mass index (BMI) Z-score. We 
hypothesized that progressive degrees of obesity would 
predict measurable decrements in QOL. 

Methods 


Sample 
and 
Procedures 


This sample was a convenience sample of subjects 
consecutively evaluated at a regional pediatric sleep lab 
for possible OSA. Overweight (BMI > 95%ile) and at-risk 
for overweight (85%ileBMI 95%ile) youth using the 
Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines who 
presented with habitual snoring (e.g., habitual snoring 
of at least 3 nights/week) were invited to participate. 
Normal weight youth (BMI < 85%ile) were not included. 
Parental written consent and age appropriate verbal or 
written assent was obtained from the youth at enrollment. 
Verbal assent was obtained from youth between the 
ages of 8 and 12 years, and written assent was obtained 
for those youth between 13 and 17 years of age. 
Evaluation at the time of study enrollment included 
history and physical examination, stage of pubertal 
development, and BMI. The accompanying parent/ 
guardian completed the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire 
(PSQ) (Chervin, Hedger, Dillion, & Pituch, 2000) to 
assess severity of symptoms suggestive of OSA. The 
subject and accompanying parent/guardian completed 
questionnaires assessing QOL (Pediatric Quality of Life 
Inventory 4.0TM; Varni, Burwinkle, Seid, & Skarr, 2003). 
Subjects subsequently underwent NPSG. Subjects and 
their families returned on a later visit to discuss PSG 
results. Thus, subjects and their families were unaware of 
study results at the time of questionnaire completion. 
All procedures were approved by the local Institutional 
Review Board. 

Measures 
and 
Instruments 


Anthropometric 


Height was measured using a wall mounted stadiometer. 
Weight was obtained on a calibrated scale. BMI percentile 
and Z-scores were calculated using 2002 CDC growth 
charts containing age-and gender-specific percentiles 
(CDC, 2004). Youth were grouped based on the CDC 
classification in which children with a BMI percentile 


Sleep 
Apnea 
and 
QOL 
271 


(BMI%ile) of 85 or greater for age and gender as ‘‘at risk 
for overweight’’ and those with a BMI%ile of equal to or 
greater than the 95 percentile for age and gender are 
classified as overweight. Degree of pubertal development 
was classified by Tanner stage and was determined by 
one study team member to control for inter-rater 
reliability and variance using standard criteria (Burns, 
Dunn, Brady, Starr, & Blosser, 2004). 

Quality 
of 
Life 


The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 (PedsQLTM 
4.0) was used to assess overall self and parental reported 
QOL. The child report was completed by subjects age 
8–12, the Teen report form age 13–18, and parent/ 
guardian completed the corresponding parental report 
form. Parents and subjects were instructed not to 
collaborate on the completion of questionnaires but 
remained in an examination room together. The 23-item 
PedsQLTM 4.0 takes on average <5 min to complete and 
assesses physical functioning (eight items), emotional 
functioning (five items), social functioning (five items), 
and school functioning (five items). Responses consisted 
of a 5-point Likert scale in which 0 ¼ 
never a problem 
and 4 ¼ 
almost always a problem. Items were reverse 
scored to a scale of 0–100 (0 ¼ 
100, 1 ¼ 
75, 2 ¼ 
50, 
3 ¼ 
25, 4 ¼ 
0) such that higher scores indicated better 
health-related QOL. A total health-related QOL score was 
obtained by summing individual question responses. 
Scale scores are computed as mean of the nonmissing 
items A published validation study used a cut-off score 
for subjects and parents report of total health-related 
QOL score to be >69.71 and 65.43, respectively as 
normal (Varni et al., 2003). Thus, for the purposes of our 
study, low QOL was defined as a self-reported total score 
of 69.71 or a parentally reported total score of 65.43. 
This questionnaire is valid and reliable with a reported a 
of .91 for the child and teenager scale, and .92 for the 
parent scale (Varni et al., 2003). This questionnaire was 
selected because it has been extensively used in the 
pediatric population and has been used in children with 
chronic illness (Schwimmer et al., 2003; Varni, 
Burwinkle, & Katz, 2004).This questionnaire has also 
been used in children/adolescents with OSA (Crabtree 
et al., 2004). 

OSA 


Subjective 
Symptoms 
of 
OSA. The PSQ developed by 
Chervin et al. (2000) was used to assess subjective 
symptoms of OSA as reported by the child’s parent/ 
guardian. The Sleep Related Breathing Disorder Subscale 
(SRBD) of the PSQ contains 22 items and assesses three 

domains: nighttime symptoms, daytime symptoms, and 
neurobehavioral symptoms associated with sleep apnea. 
The SRBD of the PSQ demonstrates adequate reliability 
(Cronbach’s a 
¼ 
.89; test–retest ¼ 
.75.) (Chervin et al., 
2000). A cut-off score of 0.33 (e.g., 33% of the 22 
questions/items answered positively) suggests the presence 
of polysomnographically demonstrable sleep apnea 
(defined by the authors as an apnea hypopnea index of 
five events or greater per hour of sleep) with a reported 
sensitivity and specificity of 0.85 and 0.87, respectively 
(Chervin et al., 2000). 

Objective 
Measure 
of 
OSA. NPSG are noninvasive tests 
that by definition can objectively quantify the severity of 
sleep disordered breathing. NPSG was performed in 
accord with the American Thoracic Society guidelines for 
sleep studies in children (American Thoracic Society, 
1996) and included the recording of electrooculogram, 
electroencephalogram, submental electromyogram, leg 
and arm electromyogram, electrocardiogram, body position, 
videotape (Embla diagnostics equipment and 
Somnologica software, Medcare, Buffalo, NY,USA), 
respiratory effort (Xactrace, Medcare, Buffalo, NY, USA), 
snoring sound (Sleepmate snoring sensor, Sleepmate 
Technologies Midlothian, VA, USA), nasal air pressure 
(Pro-Flow Plus, Pro-Tech, Mukilteo, WA, USA), end 
tidal carbon dioxide (Capnocheck Plus capnograph, 
Smiths Medical, Weston, MD, USA), and pulse 
oximetry (Onyx, Nonin Medical Inc. Plymouth MN, 
USA). Polysomnographic recordings were scored by a 
single technician certified by the Board of Registered 
Polysomnographic Technicians. Sleep staging was scored 
according to published standards (Rechtschaffen & Kales, 
1968). Arousals were defined using criteria published by 
the American Sleep Disorders Association (American 
Sleep Disorders Association, 1992). Each study was 
reviewed and interpreted by a single pediatric trained 
study physician certified by the American Board of Sleep 
Medicine. 

Obstructive apnea was defined as a reduction in 
airflow signal to 20% of baseline flow with persistent 
respiratory effort lasting longer than two baseline breaths, 
irrespective of changes in oxygen saturation. Central 
apnea was defined as an absence of respiratory effort 
associated with absence of airflow lasting longer than 20 s 
or an absence of respiratory effort associated with absence 
of airflow of any duration associated with oxygen 
desaturation of at least 4% culminating in a cortical 
arousal. Postarousal central apneic events were only 
scored if followed by an additional arousal or desaturation 
>4%. Hypopneas were defined as a reduction in 


272 
Carno 
et 
al. 


airflow signal of at least 50% but not >80% of baseline 
flow, lasting longer than 10 s and temporally associated 
with either an arousal on EEG or oxygen desaturation of 
at least 3% (Uliel, Tauman. Guenther, & Sivan, 2004). 
Mixed apneas in which both central and obstructive 
components were present were tallied as mixed events 
but included as obstructive events in the apnea index 
(AI). Obstructive apnea and obstructive apnea–hypopnea 
indices (AHI) were defined as the total number of 
respective events per hour of recorded sleep. The AHI 
was used to assess the severity of OSA. Primary snoring 
was defined as an AHI of <2; mild OSA as an AHI of 2 
but <5; and moderate to severe OSA as an AHI of greater 
than five events per hour. Normative data describing 
statistically abnormal apnea indices obtained from a 
population of normal children define an apnea index 
>1 event/hr (Moser, Phillips, Berry, & Harbison, 1995; 
Uliel et al., 2004). However, this normative data describes 
statistical 
abnormality. It remains unknown what level of 
apnea or hypopnea is clinically 
significant (American 
Thoracic Society, 1999) and many published studies use 
an AHI >5 to define OSA (e.g., TuCASA). Thus, we 
intentionally selected a conservative scale by which to 
define sleep apnea. 

Statistical 
Analysis 


Demographic, questionnaire data, and polysomnographic 
data are expressed as mean standard deviation. Values 
for AHI were log-transformed to improve normality and 
the log-transformed values were used in the analyses, 
unless otherwise noted. Paired t-test was used to assess 
for statistical differences between the parent and youth 
reported QOL. Stepwise forward linear regression was 
performed between polysomnographic variables and QOL 
reports, while controlling for BMI Z-score in order to 
ascertain independent effects of OSA and severity of 
obesity on QOL. Pearson or Spearman’s -correlation was 
performed between QOL and age, Tanner stage, BMI, 
polysomnographic and demographic variables. Chi-square 

and ANOVA analysis was performed to examine differences 
between groups. Because published literature uses 
different ‘‘cut-off’’ points to define disease versus 
nondisease, post hoc data analysis was performed using 
both a ‘‘cut-off’’ AHI of 1 event/hr as well as an AHI of 

5 events/hr to define the presence of OSA. 
Results 


The sample consisted of 151 subjects consecutively 
referred to a regional pediatric sleep center for possible 
OSA from 2005 to 2007. Subjects in the sample were 
limited to those who were overweight or at risk for 
overweight. Normal weight subjects (BMI < 85%ile) were 
not included. Thirteen (9%) subjects were at risk for 
overweight and 138 (91%) were overweight per CDC 
guidelines. NPSG data were available on 96 subjects. 
There were no statistically significant differences in 
demographic and anthropometric data obtained from 
those who underwent and those who failed to complete 
a NPSG, except that subjects who failed to complete a 
NPSG had a higher BMI Z-score (2.21 vs. 2.38; p 
¼.017). 
Demographic data corresponded to the demographics of 
the catchment area served by the pediatric sleep center 
where the study was conducted. BMI Z-score did not 
correlate with either the AHI (using Spearman ) or the 
log transformed AHI (using Pearson) (r 
¼.118 and .105; 
p 
> .05, respectively). BMI Z-score did correlate with 
SaO2 nadir (r 
¼.211, p 
¼.04) but did not correlate 
with other measured polysomnographic measures including 
total sleep time (TST). General overall information on 
PSG variables is presented in Table I and differences in 
PSG data categorized by severity of OSA are presented 
in Table II.

21.9% had an AHI of 5 9.9, and 39.6% had an 
AHI 10 events/hr. The PSQ correlated positively with 
AHI (Spearman . 
¼.238, p 
¼.022) and negatively with 
the nadir O2 saturation (r 
¼.369, p 
< .01). The 
Cronbach’s a 
from our study population was .765. 
There was no difference in PSQ score between those who 
underwent and those who failed to complete PSG. Using 
a cut-off score of 0.33 (e.g., 33% of the 22 items 
answered positively), the PSQ correctly identified OSA 
with a sensitively of 84% but only a specificity of 23% 
using an AHI 5 (as was used for the validation study 
performed by Chervin et al., 2000). 

Quality 
of 
Life 


No differences were found between the reported child 
and teen PedsQLTM 4.0 and the content is identical 
between the two versions of the questionnaires. 
Therefore, the data for the Child and Teen questionnaire 
were combined for analysis purposes and is labeled 
‘‘Youth’’ QOL. Parent/guardian QOL total score was 
significantly correlated with the subjects reported QOL 
total score (r 
¼.43, p 
< .001). Examining QOL subscale 
scores between parent and subject indicated that all four 
subscales were also significantly correlated (r 
¼.38– .46, 
p 
< .05). However, parents consistently reported significantly 
lower mean scores than their youth on the total 
QOL and all subscales (p 
< .05) as shown in Table III. 
The Cronbach’s a 
for our study population was .90 for 
both the parent QOL total score and the youth QOL total 
score. Using the published cut-off score of 65.43 for 
parent report and 69.71 for child/adolescent indicating 
low QOL, 66% of parents and 60% of subjects reported a 
substandard QOL. Neither Tanner stage nor chronological 
age significantly contributed to the prediction of total 

or subscale QOL as reported by either parents or study 
subjects. 

QOL 
and 
Obesity 


BMI Z-score predicted parental reported physical funcR2


tioning (b 
¼.22, Adj ¼.08, p 
< .05) and weakly 
correlated with parental reported total QOL (r 
¼0.17, 
p 
< .05). BMI Z-score did not correlate with subject-
reported total or subscale QOL. Neither age nor pubertal 
status correlated with severity of obesity. 

QOL 
and 
OSA 


Neither AHI, AI, peak ETCO2, time spent with 
ETCO2 > 45 mmHg; time spent with ETCO2 > 50 mmHg 
nor sleep efficiency significantly contributed to the 
prediction of total or subscale QOL of either parent or 
youth surveys. There were no significant differences in 
reported QOL between the primary snoring group compared 
to subjects with an AHI of 2 or greater. Fifty-five 
percent of parents and 64% of children with primary 
snoring reported substandard QOL, whereas 62% of parents 
and 60% of children with OSA reported substandard 
QOL. As shown in Table IV, whether OSA was defined as 
an AI of 1 event/hr or greater; an AHI of 2 events/hr

emotional function correlated with OSA (Spearman

not. No parentally reported QOL subscales correlated with 
severity of OSA as measured by AHI. 
Interestingly, PSQ significantly predicted QOL on all 
total and subscales for both parental and youth report as 
shown in Table V. Using the published cut-off scores for 
QOL, a PSQ score 0.33 confers a relative risk for poor 
quality of life (parental report) of 89%, while for youth it 
is 68% in our sample. 

Discussion 


QOL in youth is decreased in a number of chronic 
medical conditions ranging from velopharyngeal insufficiency 
to chronic pain (Barr, Thibeault, Muntz, & 
de Serres, 2007; Connelly & Rapoff, 2006; Merlijn 
et al., 2006; Youssef, Murphy, Langseder, & Rosh, 2006). 
Youth with recurrent headaches report lower physical 
functioning and psychosocial functioning when compared 
to healthy controls. Furthermore, reported QOL improves 
with response to treatment suggesting a cause-and-effect 
relationship (Connelly & Rapoff, 2006). Youth with 
chronic pain report a lower QOL that correlates with 
increased pain intensity and frequency. Psychosocial 
factors including vulnerability, reinforcement, modeling 
and coping are also strongly associated with QOL 
suggesting that adaptive family routines predict improved 
QOL (Merlijn et al., 2006). 

Our results show that QOL is quite low in 
overweight and at risk for overweight youth who snore. 
Parents consistently report lower QOL for their children 
than the subjects themselves. Reported QOL in our 
population of overweight habitually snoring subjects is 
similar to that reported in the literature (Zeller & Modi, 
2006) for overweight pediatric patients not screened for 
snoring. Recent studies (O’Brien et al., 2004; Urschitz 
et al., 2004) have reported negative health consequences 
associated with snoring. While adverse health consequences 
of OSA have been well described, it is now

becoming clear that snoring alone may confer negative 
risk for health-related outcomes as well. We found no 
correlation between polysomnographic measures of OSA 
and QOL, but did find a substantial relationship between 
symptoms of OSA (as measured by the PSQ) and QOL. 
One possible explanation for these findings is that 
variables not traditionally measured on NPSG result in 
decreased QOL. Alternatively, children with milder forms 
of OSA and those with primary snoring may experience a 
more significant negative impact on health and well-being 
than previously appreciated. As the field of pediatric OSA 
progresses, more sensitive and sophisticated measures/ 
variables, obtained during night time sleep studies 
may come to the forefront and be better predictors 
of QOL. 

Our results are in agreement with the published 
results from Crabtree, Varni, and Gozal. In their study, 
85 clinically referred, snoring children (8–12 years) were 
compared to 35 asymptomatic children in relation to 
QOL and depressive symptoms. Using multiple cut 
points in AHI to define OSA, the authors did not 
find a difference in QOL based on definition of OSA. 
Overall, snoring children had a lower reported QOL 
grouping comparison to nonsnoring controls. (Crabtree 
et al., 2004). 

We did not find a correlation between TST and 
youth or parentally reported QOL. Published literature 
(Wolfson & Carskadon, 1998) demonstrates that adolescents 
who sleep less by self-report are more likely to 
struggle academically, report daytime sleepiness, depressive 
mood, and sleep/wake behavior problems. In a 
large (n 
¼ 
2,259) cohort study of Illinois middle school 
students, Fredriksen, Rhodes, Reddy and Way (2004) 
showed that students who reported less sleep on 
school nights reported heightened levels of depressive 
symptoms and decreased self-esteem. It is likely that 
our study failed to identify a relationship between 
sleep time and QOL because sleep time was measured

and

during overnight PSG rather than by self-report or by 
more longitudinal measures in the home such as 
actigraphy. 

Our data demonstrated that children with obesity 
have lower parental reported physical functioning but 
that children do not report this difference. This is 
similar to previously reported findings in the literature 
(Pinhas-Hamiel et al., 2006). It is possible that parental 
concerns for their child’s health resulting from the adult’s 
better understanding of the health-related consequences 
of obesity. Another possibility could be that the youth 
have ‘‘adjusted’’ to the lower functioning and perceive 
their QOL as normal. 

Finally, we examined only, QOL in the subjects. It is 
known that there are other psychological concerns in 
children who are overweight. These issues include 
anxiety, depression, and low-self esteem (Young-Hyman 
et al., 2006). These other factors could be contributing to 
the low QOL exhibited by our subjects in addition to the 
OSA and weight issues. 

This study has a number of strengths. This is an 
important study given the rising prevalence of both 
obesity and OSA, the interaction between them as well as 
the known morbidities for each. Full NPSG was utilized 
including end-tidal capnography, thereby enabling accurate 
detection of sleep-associated gas exchange abnormalities. 
The relatively large study population accurately 
reflects a ‘‘typical’’ population of overweight children and 
adolescents referred for possible OSA. Stratification based 
on pubertal development allowed us to assess for 
developmental aspects of the impact of obesity and 
OSA on QOL. 

There are also several limitations to this study. Many 
subjects failed to complete recommended PSG. It is 
possible that a larger sample size could have indicated 
additional correlations between polysomnographic variables 
and QOL. Virtually, all of the children in our 
sample were at or about the 95%ile for BMI. Thus, the 
BMI Z-score is severely restricted. Thus, it is likely that 
significant correlations between BMI Z-score and QOL 
could have been identified if the distribution of BMI 
Z-scores was more evenly dispersed amongst the at-risk 
for overweight and overweight categories or if a group of 
normal weight children had been included. Likewise, it is 
also possible that significant correlations between NPSG 
variables and stronger correlations between the PSQ score 
and QOL could have been identified if a group of normal 
children without evidence of obstructive breathing during 
sleep had been used as the control group rather than 
children with habitual snoring. Larger studies including 

normal weight youth and those without symptoms 
suggestive of OSA are needed. 

Interpretations of pediatric NPSGs may vary considerably 
from one laboratory to the next. To date, 
only three studies have presented normal PSG values 
for children and adolescents (Marcus et al., 1992; 
Montgomery-Downs, O’Brien, Gulliver, & Gozal, 2006; 
Uliel et al., 2004) and specific definitions of scoreable 
events differ even between these two studies. Whereas 
definitions of obstructive apneas are relatively straight 
forward, subtleties in the definition of hypopneas vary 
widely. Some laboratories use a definition that reflects the 
duration of pediatric apneas (i.e., 2-breath rule), while 
other laboratories (including our own) have undertaken a 
definition that mirrors the adult definition of hypopneas 
(i.e., 10 s duration) making comparison of results 
between laboratories more difficult. 

In summary, this study demonstrates poor QOL as 
reported by both youth and their parents in a cohort of 
overweight and at risk for overweight pediatric patients 
evaluated for possible OSA. An increase in parental-
reported symptoms of OSA predict poor QOL, whereas 
polysomnographic measures do not, suggesting that the 
symptoms of OSA themselves may impact negatively on 
daily functioning. If confirmed in future studies, QOL 
may become an important variable to assess the need for 
intervention in the treatment of snoring youth.
