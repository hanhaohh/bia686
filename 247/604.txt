Objective: We hypothesized that mandibular size may play a role in the 
etiology of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in children, since a 
smaller mandible may reduce airway size. We used magnetic resonance 
imaging to determine the mandible dimensions of children with OSAS. 
Design: Case control study. 
Setting: Tertiary-care pediatric hospital. 
Participants: Twenty-four subjects (mean age 4.9 ± 1.7 years) with mild 
to moderate OSAS (Apnea Index 3.5 ± 5.1), and 24 matched controls 
(mean age 4.9 ± 1.8 years). 
Intervention: Magnetic resonance imaging of the upper airway under 
sedation. 
Measurements: Eight measurements were obtained from a 3-dimensional 
segmentation of the mandible using 3DVIEWNIX software. 
Measurements included length, height, width, midsymphysis menti angle, 


angle of mandible, enclosure area, surface area, and volume. Descriptive 
comparisons using Student t test and multivariate analyses of variance 
were performed. 
Results: Individual measurement comparisons revealed no significant differences 
between groups. Multivariate analysis showed a lower bound of 
a 95% confidence interval for an effect size measure for “general 
mandibular size,” including all 6 linear, the area, and the volume measurements, 
to be -0.25. 
Conclusion: Our study shows that a smaller mandible is not a feature in 
children with OSAS who do not have apparent craniofacial abnormalities.

INTRODUCTION 

OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA SYNDROME (OSAS) IN 
CHILDREN IS CHARACTERIZED BY PROLONGED PARTIAL 
OR INTERMITTENT COMPLETE UPPER-AIRWAY 
OBSTRUCTION, WHICH AFFECTS NORMAL VENTILATION 
DURING SLEEP.Both anatomic and neuromotor mechanisms 
are considered to play a role in the causation of OSAS.1 
The disorder affects about 2% of children and is associated with 
a high degree of morbidity, including growth retardation, neurobehavioral 
deficiencies, and cardiovascular complications.2,3 

In adults, anatomic factors such as obesity and increased size 
of the tongue, soft palate, pharyngeal fat pads, and lateral pharyngeal 
walls, as well as a decrease in mandible size, have been 
identified as important parameters affecting airway caliber and 
risk for OSAS.4-9 In children, aged 2 to 8 years, the primary 
anatomic cause for OSAS relates to adenotonsillar hypertrophy,
1,10,11 although abnormalities in the development of the 
lower-face skeleton have also been suggested.12,13 

Studies in adults with OSAS suggest that the mandible is shorter 
and displaced more posteriorly.8,14,15 Micrognathia and retrognathia 
affect the anterior-posterior airway size in children with 
various congenital syndromes involving the lower face, such as 
Treacher Collin syndrome and Pierre Robin sequence, leading to

OSAS in many cases.16-20 However, conflicting information 
about the role of the mandible exists in children with OSAS but 
without underlying craniofacial anomalies.21-24 

Cephalometry measurements on a 2-dimensional midsagittal 
radiograph are most commonly used to assess the facial skeleton, 
soft tissues, and airway dimensions in both adults and children. 
This method has a significant limitation in that it cannot quantify 
the 3-dimensional shape of the airway and surrounding structures. 
Alternatively, computed tomography has excellent resolution 
for bone and air and may provide useful 3-dimensional information 
on the facial skeleton. However, due to the radiation 
involved, computed tomography has provided limited information 
in clinical research on this issue. A more practical modality 
for imaging the upper-airway structure is magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI). It is readily available, provides an intrinsically 
scaled image, and gives superior contrast for soft-tissue structures 
and good contrast for bony structures. Three-dimensional 
MRI has been used to evaluate the upper airway in adults,25-29 
and in children, predominantly focusing on lymphoid structures 
and airway caliber.11,30-32 

In the present study, we wished to investigate mandibular size 
and shape in children with OSAS as compared to controls using 
3-dimensional MRI segmentation of the mandible. We hypothesized 
that the mandible in children with OSAS would be smaller 
compared to that of controls and would be contributory to OSAS, 
as suggested by studies in adult.8,14,15 

MATERIAL AND METHODS 

The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of 
the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Informed consent was 
obtained from each subject’s parent and assent was obtained from 
children older than 6 years of age.

Subjects 

Children with OSAS were recruited serially from the pool of 
patients evaluated for sleep-disordered breathing at the 
Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. All had normal growth and 
development and no clinically apparent craniofacial anomalies or 
genetic disorders. After OSAS was confirmed by polysomnography, 
parents gave consent for their child to undergo upper-airway 
MRI under sedation. 

Control subjects were paired to match OSAS subjects by age, 
sex, ethnicity, weight, and height. Controls were selected from 
patients who underwent head MRI for other medical indications. 
All had normal growth and development. Parents gave consent 
for an upper-airway MRI that followed head MRI. No additional 
sedation was given. 

Exclusion criteria for controls included (1) likelihood of OSAS 
assessed by (a) standard sleep questionnaire33 and (b) 
polysomnography in 12 of the 24 subjects; (2) evidence of a brain 
tumor or a seizure disorder requiring therapy; (3) genetic disorders 
associated with any craniofacial anomaly; and (4) chronic 
respiratory disease such as asthma or bronchopulmonary dysplasia. 


Sleep Questionnaire 

Symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing were assessed 
according to a questionnaire developed by Brouillette et al.33 
Subjects with scores below -1 are not expected to have OSAS; a 
score between -1 and 3.5 is considered intermediate, and a score 
> 3.5 is considered highly suggestive for OSAS. 

Overnight Polysomnography 

Polysomnography was used to establish the diagnosis of sleep-
disordered breathing in subjects with OSAS and to exclude 
OSAS in controls. Polysomnography was performed 0 to 4 weeks 
before MRI on subjects with OSAS and 2 to 4 weeks after MRI 
in controls. Subjects were studied in the Sleep Disorders Center 
at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Scoring of respiratory 
variables was performed based on standards set by the American 
Thoracic Society and previously published data in children.34,35 
Flow was measured using an oral-nasal thermistor and a nasal 
end-tidal PCO2 catheter. Chest and abdominal-wall movement 
were assessed by respiratory inductance plethysmography. We 
used the definition of obstructive apnea as absence of oral-nasal 
thermistor signal for at least 2 respiratory cycles associated with 
out-of-phase movement of the rib cage and abdomen. Hypopnea 
was defined as a decrease of 50% or more in oral-nasal thermistor 
signal and a concurrent fall in 4% or more of basal oxygen 
saturation. Sleep stages were determined by the criteria of 
Rechtschaffen and Kales.36 

Arousals were scored according to American Sleep Disorders 
Association task force criteria37 and lasted at least 3 seconds. An 
awakening was defined as an arousal lasting more than 15 seconds 
or Wake score according to Rechtschaffen and Kales criteria.
36 Arousal and Awakening Index was the sum of arousal and 
awakenings per hour of sleep. 

Magnetic Resonance Imaging 

MRI studies were performed in the Department of Radiology 

at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. All studies were performed 
under sedation. Sedation included an intravenous administration 
of pentobarbital at 2-mg/kg increments until sleep was 
achieved. A maximum of 3 doses or 200 mg was administered. 
All subjects were monitored continuously by pulse oximetry and 
were observed by an intensive-care physician until recovery (~1 
hour). 

All magnetic resonance (MR) images were obtained as part of 
a larger ongoing project using a comprehensive MRI protocol. 
Images of 13 subjects in this study (8 OSAS, 5 controls) were 
used in a previous study11 and were now processed for the first 
time using a new methodology (see below) to delineate the 3 
dimensional structure of the mandible. 

MRI was performed with a 1.5T Siemens Vision system 
(Iselin, NJ). Images were acquired using a commercially available 
anterior-posterior volume head coil. The patient’s head was 
positioned supine in the soft-tissue Frankfort plane (tragus of the 
ear to orbital fissure) perpendicular to the table. All images initially 
included a rapid spin echo sagittal localizing scan to confirm 
that the field of view (FOV) and centering were appropriate. 

Sequential T1 and T2-weighted spin echo axial sections were 
obtained, spanning from the orbital cavity to the larynx to include 
the entire mandible. The following parameters were used for the 
axial T1-weighted images: TR = 650 milliseconds, TE = 14 milliseconds, 
192 x 256 matrix size, slice thickness 3 mm with distance 
factor 0, 1 acq, FOV = 20 to 24 cm, RECFOV 6/8. The 
parameters used for T2-weighted images were: TR = 6000 milliseconds, 
TE = 90 milliseconds, 110 x 256 matrix size, slice 
thickness 3 mm with distance factor 0, 1 acq, FOV = 20 to 24 cm, 
RECFOV 6/8. 

Image Processing and Anatomic Measurements 

Mandible components on each axial MR slice were manually 
segmented by a trained image analyst, creating a mask file 
(Figure 1). The mask file was interpolated to isotropic voxel 
dimensions of 0.5 mm x 0.5 mm x 0.5 mm by using a shape-
based interpolation. The resulting image was smoothed by applying 
a Gaussian filter. The filtered images then underwent thresh-
holding at the same intervals for the purpose of construction of 
the mandibular surface (Figure 2). All processing and analysis 
operations were carried out by using the 3DVIEWNIX software 
system.38,39 

Once constructed, the mandible object could be rotated (Figure 
3) and surface anatomic landmarks could be designated (eg, midsymphysis 
menti, angle of mandible). These landmarks were 
used to establish linear distances and angular measurements that 
characterize the overall size of the mandible. Total surface area 
and volume were determined by the program. 

Anatomic landmarks included the mid-symphysis menti—the 
central point on the anterior mandible midline—and the angle of 
mandible—the point where the posterior-inferior border of the 
ramus joins the lower border of the body of the mandible (Figure 
2). 

Mandibular measurements included the following 8 dimensions 
(figure 3): (1) the mandible length—the distance between 
the mid-symphysis menti and the angle of the mandible, (2) the 
mandible height—the distance between the angle of mandible 
and the geometric center in the condylar surface, (3) the mandible 
width—the intermandible angle distance, (4), the mid-symphysis 

SLEEP, Vol. 27, No. 5, 2004 960 Mandibular Dimensions in Children with OSAS—Schiffman et al 


menti angle—the angle enclosed between both mandible length 
lines, (5) the mandible angle—the angle enclosed between the 
mandible length line and the mandible height line; (6) the 
mandible enclosure area—the area of the triangle formed by connecting 
the two angles of mandible and mid-symphysis menti, (7) 
the mandible surface area—the computed surface area of the 
mandible, and (8) the mandible volume—the computed volume 
enclosed by the entire mandible surface. 

Accuracy of Measurements 

A human mandible specimen was used as a phantom to assess 
the accuracy of our measurements. Six linear measurements were 
obtained directly from the isolated mandible using calipers and 
were compared to the measurements obtained from the mandible 
after segmentation and construction, using an identical MRI 
sequence and image-processing algorithms. Validation measurements 
were mandible length, mandible height, mandible width, 
coronoid-inner condyle distance, mid-symphysis menti height, 
and minimal ramus width. 

Data Analysis 

Descriptive comparisons of individual parameters were performed 
using Student t tests after confirming variance homogeneity 
between groups. All values are reported as mean ± SD. 

Figure 1—Mandible segmentation shown in green at level of mandibu-
lar: body, ramus low, ramus high, and condyle-coronoid. 
Multivariate analyses of group differences were performed in 
order to maximize statistical power by accounting for correlations 
among mandibular parameters, to account for multiple comparisons, 
and to determine multivariate standardized effect-size 
measures useful for interpreting negative findings. These analyses 
included multivariate analysis of variance, principle components 
analysis of dimensionality, and factor analysis. 
Significance levels of P<.05 were used to determine statistical 
significance for group differences, while P<.10 was used for 
interaction tests to compensate for the reduced power of such 
tests. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 8.2 
(SAS, Inc., Cary, NC). 

RESULTS 

We studied 24 children with OSAS, mean age 4.9 ± 1.7 years 
(range 2.9-8.6 years), and 24 matched control subjects, mean age 

4.9 ± 1.8 years (range 2.5-8.7 years). Children with OSAS were 
not significantly different from controls with respect to age, sex, 
ethnicity, height, or weight (Table 1). All subjects were full term 
except 1 control who was born at 34 weeks gestation. All subjects 
had normal development and cognitive function and intact tonsils 
and adenoids. The primary indication for head MRI in controls 
were the following: single seizure or febrile convulsion without 
therapy (15 subjects), headache (5 subjects), head tilt (1 subject), 
transient change in mental status (1 subject), dermoid cyst of eyebrow 
(1 subject), suspected arterial venous malformation (1 subject). 
All controls and OSAS subjects were found to have no 
apparent abnormality of the brain by MRI. 
According to the sleep questionnaires, all controls had a 
Brouillette apnea score less than -1, indicating the absence of 
obstructive sleep apnea.33 The mean score for the control group 
was -3.0 ± 0.6, and the OSAS group had a significantly higher 
score with a mean of +2.7 ± 1.5 (P < .001). 

Twelve of the 24 controls volunteered to undergo polysomnography 
(Table 2). None had evidence of sleep-disordered breathing, 
and they had similar Brouillette scores to those who did not 
agree to have polysomnography. The polysomnography results

indicated significant differences between the OSAS group and 
controls in apnea index (number per hour) 3.5 ± 5.1 versus 0.1 ± 

0.3 (P<.001); apnea-hypopnea index (number per hour) 9.8 ± 
11.1 versus 0.4 ± 0.3 (P<.001); arousal-awakening index (number 
per hour) 18.1 ± 9.0 versus 9.3 ± 4.3 (P<.05); and SpO2 
nadir 84% ± 9% versus 92% ± 2% (P<.05). The findings suggest 
that the OSAS group had mild to moderate sleep-disordered 
breathing. 
Descriptive comparisons of the 8 independent parameters 
using Student t tests revealed no significant differences between 
groups (Table 3). Multivariate analyses confirmed these findings. 
First, group differences did not significantly vary across 
mandibular parameters either with standardization for age differences 
(Wilks .: F7,40 = 1.65, P=.149) or without standardization 
for age (F7,40 = 1.83, P=.109). Then, we found that, overall, 
OSAS and controls did not differ significantly either with stan-

of the mandible. Variances explained by each factor after orthogonal 
rotation were 52.5%, 20.1%, and 13.3%, respectively. The 
mean ± SD (t test P values) for Factors 1, 2, and 3 in the OSAS 
and control groups were +0.163 ± 1.027 versus -0.163 ± 0.966 (P

0.055 ± 0818 versus +0.055 ± 1.170 (P=.710), respectively. The 
values for “general mandibular size” imply a standardized effect 
size equal to 0.33 (95% confidence interval = -0.25-0.91). That 
is, the mean value in the OSAS group was one third of a SD larger 
than the mean in the control group. The lower bound of the 
confidence interval (-0.25) rules out all but relatively small 
reductions in mandibular sizes among children with mild to moderate 
OSAS with statistical confidence and demonstrates that our 
negative findings are not explainable by inadequate sample size. 
The effect sizes for the minor dimensions were 0.09 (95% confidence 
interval = -0.55-0.41) and -0.11 (95% confidence interval 
= -0.70-0.48), respectively. 
Finally, mean accuracy of MRI measurements obtained with 
calipers from the isolated mandible specimen in comparison to 
those obtained from its MRI reconstruction was -0.28% ± 3.3%, 
(r = 0.99, P < .001, Figure 4). 

DISCUSSION 

We performed a detailed analysis of the mandible size and 
shape for children with mild to moderate OSAS and their 
matched controls using MRI methodology and 3-dimensional 
segmentation and construction. We did not find that any of our set 
of mandibular dimensions were smaller in the OSAS group as we 
had hypothesized, a factor that could be expected to contribute to 
a smaller airway and increased propensity for OSAS in these subjects. 
On the contrary, multivariate analysis of our data suggests 
that, on average, a slight tendency for a larger mandible is found 
among children with OSAS compared to controls. 

A limitation of the study relates to the technical method by 
which we detected hypopneas during sleep using an oral-nasal 
thermistor rather than nasal pressure transducer cannulas. It 
should also be emphasized that mandibular dimensions could be 
statistically different in children with more severe sleep-disordered 
breathing who were not included in the present study. 

The etiology of OSAS in children has been established mainly 
through the amelioration of symptoms after surgical removal of 
enlarged adenoid and tonsils.40 However, adenotonsillectomy has 
been reported to be curative in only about 80% of the cases,2,10,4143 
suggesting that other anatomic factors such as craniofacial

structures or functional mechanisms (neuromotor tone) could 
affect upper-airway size during sleep and predispose the child to 
having to OSAS. 

There are several important reasons why craniofacial structures 
are thought to be important risk factors for pediatric OSAS. First, 
sleep apnea is common and severe in children with distinct mid-
and lower-face craniofacial anomalies such as Pierre-Robin 
sequence17,18 and Treacher-Collins,44 Apert,19 and Down syndromes45,46; 
correction of these anomalies using mandibular distraction 
osteogenesis and mandibular advancement47-49 has 
resulted in reduction of OSAS. Second, there is evidence that in 
children without distinct craniofacial anomalies, there are more 
subtle craniofacial morphologies correlating to OSAS that have 
been demonstrated using cephalometrics.21,24,50,51 Third, few 
studies suggest underlying craniofacial morphometric abnormalities 
leading to recurrent OSAS during adolescence in children 
who previously underwent adenotonsillectomy.12,13 It is therefore 
possible that OSAS may be caused by a combination of both 
lymphoid-tissue hypertrophy in the velopharynx and abnormalities 
in the development of the lower-face skeleton. Other studies 
documenting mandibular abnormalities in childhood OSAS suggest 
that these changes are actually secondary to obstructive 
breathing and that mandibular remodeling can occur after surgical 
correction of the obstruction.50,52,53 

As part of assessing the entire upper-airway structure in a previous 
study, we performed 2 mandibular measurements, including 
intermandibular width at the maximum tonsil cross-section, 
and assessment of mandibular length by measuring the mental 
spine-clivus distance. These did not differ from OSAS children to 
controls.11 The current comprehensive study focused on 3-dimensional 
aspects of the mandible by allowing us to perform actual 
surface-to-surface measurements on the mandible after construction. 
We also performed a validation study to ensure that our 
method of segmentation and construction was accurate. This 
richer set of measurements was subjected to multivariate statisti-

Figure 4—Correlation between 6 linear measurements obtained from 
the isolated mandible and the respective measurements obtained from 
the constructed mandible.

cal analysis in order to investigate any latent mandibular characteristics 
that were manifest in correlations among the observed 
measures. The dominant latent characteristic found, general 
mandibular size, was compared between groups. 

With 24 subjects in each group, this study had 80% power 
(assuming 2-sided a = .05) to reject the null hypothesis of no 
group difference in means for a specific mandibular parameter 
only for standardized effect sizes larger than 0.83 (effect size is 
the difference in means divided by the common SD). To interpret 
this, assume that among controls the true mean and SD of 
mandibular volume was equal to the values observed in this study 
(ie, mean = 25 cm3, SD = 6 cm3). Under these assumptions, our 
study achieves adequate statistical power only if the mean among 
children with OSAS is more than 0.83 × 6 = 4.9 cm3 smaller than 
the control mean (ie, 19.6% smaller or smaller than 20.1 cm3). 
However, the lower bound of our 95% confidence interval for a 
multivariate effect-size measure for “general mandibular size” 
was -0.25. Therefore, we can conclude with “95% confidence” 
that the mean general mandibular size is no more than one fourth 
of a SD smaller among children with OSAS compared to normal 
children. Thus, it is unlikely that our study missed an important 
systematic reduction in mandibular size among children with 
OSAS due to inadequate sample number. 

Most studies in children with OSAS using cephalometrics 
address the aspect of mandibular position rather than size. 
Kawashima et al22 reported that children with OSAS and more 
pronounced tonsillar hypertrophy had retrognathic mandibles and 
increased posterior facial height compared to children with 
OSAS and less-pronounced tonsillar hypertrophy. Zucconi et al23 
noted that children with habitual snoring and obstructive sleep 
apnea had increased craniomandibular, intermaxillary, gonial, 
and mandibular plane angles, indicating a hyperdivergent growth 
pattern. The above may indicate mandibular remodeling secondary 
to nasopharyngeal obstruction and not necessarily an 
inherent mandibular size or shape difference from the norm. 
Shintani et al24 noted that maxillary protrusion (position of the 
maxilla with respect to the cranial base) did not increase from age 
1 to 9 years. The relationship of the mandible with respect to the 
cranial base was found to be retrognathic at all ages examined (19 
years). Retrognathia decreased with increasing age, and the relative 
position of the mandible with respect to the maxilla was 
increasingly prognathic with age. This is in contrast to the other 
studies cited above. 

We studied the size and shape of the mandible and not its position 
with respect to the skull. It is possible that the position of the 
mandible in relation to the maxilla or cranial base is altered in 
children with OSAS, as suggested by 2-dimensional cephalometric 
studies. This is important, since both a small mandible and a 
retroposed mandible could reduce upper-airway size and predispose 
to airway narrowing during sleep. Therefore, further studies 
addressing the 3-dimensional position of the mandible to the 
maxilla and cranial base are important for understanding the 
complete contribution of the mandible to the occurrence of 
OSAS in children. 

In conclusion, our study shows that a smaller mandible is not 
found in children with mild to moderate OSAS who do not exhibit 
distinct craniofacial abnormalities. However, the position of the 
mandible could still be an important anatomic factor contributing 
to occurrence of OSAS in children.
