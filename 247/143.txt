Abstract—Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is 
observed in approximately 2% of children. Heart rate variability 
(HRV) is a potentially simple, non-invasive diagnostic 
screening tool for OSAS. In this study, we investigated the 
diagnostic potential of HRV using power spectral analysis, 
numerical titration, sample entropy, and detrended fluctuation 
analysis. Effects of sleep stages (REM and NREM sleep) are 
evaluated. The results show that the heart rate chaos intensity, 
as measured by the noise limit in numerical titration, is 
significantly higher during REM sleep than NREM sleep in all 
patient groups. By using the receiver-operating characteristic 
analysis, the detection of OSAS yielded a specificity of 72.2% 
and sensitivity of 81.3% using the numerical-titration 
technique. The findings suggest that sleep state and disordered 
breathing are important determinants of cardiac autonomic 
control. Nonlinear techniques such as numerical titration, when 
used in conjunction with spectral analysis of HRV could be an 
effective screening tool for pediatric OSAS.

I. INTRODUCTION

BSTRUCTIVE sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a 
common nocturnal breathing abnormality in which the 
airflow is impeded by a narrow upper airway despite 
continued respiratory efforts. Studies suggest that OSAS is 
an important risk factor for various complications such as 
cardiovascular diseases, arterial hypertension, myocardial 
infarction, hyperactivity and neurocognitive deficits [1]. 
OSAS reportedly affects 2 – 4% of children [2]-[3]. During 
obstructive apnea, increased respiratory effort leads to an 
increase in the negative intrathoracic pressure and an 
increase in the afferents inputs from the lungs and the chest 
wall to the autonomic nervous system (ANS), thus affecting

cardiovascular autonomic control [4]. In addition, the 
termination of airway obstruction is frequently accompanied 
by sympathetic activation. 

The gold standard for the clinical diagnosis of OSAS in 
children is polysomonography (PSG), consisting of simultaneous 
recordings of electrophysiological and respiratory 
signals, and overnight monitoring of the patient in a 
specially-equipped sleep laboratory. However, the scarcity of 
pediatric sleep clinics and the expense associated with 
standard PSG underestimates the number of pediatric OSAS 
cases. In addition, until recently, adult criteria were used to 
detect pediatric OSAS, producing inaccurate results [5]. 
Thus, a simple, less costly, noninvasive, reliable and ambulatory 
screening method for pediatric OSAS is desirable. 

Analysis of heart rate variability (HRV), as indicated by 
the beat-to-beat fluctuation in the electrocardiogram (ECG) 
signal, has become an increasingly popular noninvasive 
approach for assessing cardiovascular autonomic control. 
The R-R interval (RRI)—the time between successive heart 
beats—is based mainly on two components: the intrinsic 
firing rate of the sinoatrial (SA) node of the heart and the 
regulation of the SA node firing rate by the collective inputs 
of the ANS. HRV can provide information on the relative 
inputs of the two ANS mutually antagonistic components— 
the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), which acts to 
increase heart rate, and the parasympathetic nervous system 
(PSNS), which acts to slow the heart, and dilate blood 
vessels [6]-[9]. 

Since HRV is an output of a deterministic system, i.e. the 
ANS, changes in HRV may reflect abnormalities in the 
system. This “deterministic” hypothesis of HRV has been the 
subject of intense investigation in recent years. Cyclical 
variation in heart rate was described as being characteristic 
of OSAS [10]. The unique heart rate rhythm of bradytachycardia 
in OSAS [11] may provide the basis for an 
effective screening tool. 

Standard spectral analysis of HRV can provide analytical 
features of its cyclic variation but cannot show the dynamical 
properties of the fluctuations. Furthermore, it has been 
shown that ANS control underlies the nonlinearity and 
possible chaos of normal HRV [12]. In the present study we 
aimed to systematically compare various time-series metrics 
for diagnosis and quantification of pediatric OSAS from 
electrocardiogram recordings alone. We also used the 
Wigner-Ville transform to perform a time-frequency domain 
analysis of the instant changes of autonomic control 
occurring during apnea episodes. In addition, we sought to 
examine the sleep-apnea severity in different sleep states.

II. METHODOLOGY 
A. Data Acquisition 
The study consisted of 52 subjects: 16 were classified as 
severe/moderate OSAS, 18 are mild/borderline, and 18 are 
normal. All subjects underwent a standard nocturnal 
polysomnographic study at Johns Hopkins Hospital. ECG 
recordings, apnea events and sleep stages were acquired 
using Respironics Alice 3 Healthdyn Systems. All subjects 
were free of lung or neuromuscular disease, cardiac pathology 
or arrhythmia. 

Obstructive apnea is defined as cessation of oronasal 
airflow in presence of respiratory efforts lasting longer than 
two respiratory cycle times. Hypopnea is defined as a 
discernible reduction in amplitude of oronasal airflow 
accompanied by a 4% oxygen desaturation and/or arousal. 
The apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) is defined as the number of 
apnea and hypopnea events per hour of sleep and a threshold 
of AHI = 10 h-1 identifies children with OSA. The mean 
apnea-hypopnea index was 27.9 ± 2.8 h-1 for severe OSAS 
subjects, 12.02 ± 2.5 h-1 for moderate. 

B. Signal Conditioning/Feature Extraction 
Using the Alice 3 software, a continuous three-hour ECG 
recording was extracted for each subject. The three-hour 
recording also included at least one continuous 10-minute 
segment of each sleep stage: rapid eye movement (REM), 
stage-2 sleep and stage-4 sleep. The sleep stages were scored 
every 30 seconds. In addition, the three-hour recording 
captured apnea/hypopnea events consistent with the AHI of 
the OSAS patients. 

The ECG was sampled at 100 Hz with 8-bit precision. The 
R-waves fiducial points were detected using a Hilbert 
transform-based peak extraction algorithm [13]. RRI was 
visually screened for artifacts, manual editing was performed 
to a very high standard. No attempt was made to distinguish 
normal sinus beats from ectopic beats. The beat-to-beat 
(R-R) interval (measured in milliseconds) time series was 
obtained by plotting the sequential intervals between beat i 
and beat i+1. The RRI time series was converted into equally 
spaced samples in time by cubic spline interpolation with a 
sampling rate of 4 Hz. 

C. Analysis 
1) Numerical Titration 

Numerical titration [14] is currently the only algorithm 
available that provides a sufficient test for chaotic dynamics 
in noise-contaminated experimental time series. Rather than 
filtering the noise before chaos analysis, which could risk 
“bleaching” the chaotic dynamics [15], the numerical 
titration technique is analogous to a chemical titration: it 
measures chaos (acidity) by a controlled neutralization with 
added noise (base), thus allowing a “litmus test” for chaos. 

Under the numerical titration scheme, the output noise 
limit (NL) > 0 indicates the presence of chaos, and the value 
of NL also gives an estimate of its relative intensity. 

Conversely, if NL = 0, then it may be inferred that the time 
series is either non-chaotic or the chaotic component has 
been neutralized by the noise floor in the data. Therefore, the 
condition NL > 0 provides a simple sufficient test for chaos. 

In this study, numerical titration was applied on the RRI 
time series with a 5-minute-long window that slides at 
30-second intervals. 

2) Approximate Entropy and Sample Entropy 

Approximate entropy (ApEn) is a statistical index that 
quantifies the unpredictability of fluctuations in a time series 
[16]-[18]. ApEn provides quantitative information about the 
complexity of experimental data that are often short and 
noise contaminated, and in many cases, have inherent 
dynamics that exhibit both deterministic and stochastic 
behaviors. ApEn reflects the logarithmic likelihood that two 
sequences that are similar (within a tolerance r) for m points 
remain similar at the next point. A time series that exhibits 
frequent and similar epochs has a relatively small ApEn 
value, reflecting a high degree of regularity. 

ApEn is inherently biased because self matches are 
incorrectly counted to avoid the occurrence of logarithm of 
zero in the calculations; its expected value is not equal to the 
parameter it estimates. In addition, it has been suggested that 
this method may heavily depend on the data length and lacks 
relative consistency; that is, if ApEn of one data set is higher 
than that of another for one set of parameters m and r, it 
should, but does not remain higher for different parameters 
of m and r [19]. To correct for this inconsistency and to 
reduce bias, a variant of ApEn, known as sample entropy 
(SampEn), was introduced by Richman [19]. 

In this study, we computed ApEn and SampEn for each of 
the 5-minute segments of the heart-rate time series. We 
chose m = 2 and r = 20% of the standard deviation for the 
5-minute segment. A mean value for entropy was obtained to 
characterize each segment. 

3) Detrended Fluctuation Analysis 

Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) [20]-[21] is a 
scaling analysis that quantifies long-range power-law 
correlation exponents in a signal. This technique is a 
modification of root-mean-square analysis of random walks 
applied to non-stationary data. Unlike the other statistics 
used in this study, which are based on the segmented RRI 
time series, the DFA index is based on the full length RRI, 
since DFA requires long data sets. The short-range (as, 
4 = 
n = 
16) and long-range (al, n > 16) correlations were 
computed for each patient. 

4) Wigner-Ville Distribution 

Spectral analysis has been widely applied to separate the 
oscillatory components of the HRV relating to the 
sympathetic and parasympathetic response of the ANS [7], 
[22]. However, the spectrum does not tell us the time 
dependence of the frequency components. The time 
dependence of the frequency content is obscured, since the 
Fourier transform decomposes the signal into complex 
exponentials that are unlocalized in time. Furthermore, 

3566 



spectral analysis of HRV requires some level of stationarity, 
which is a premise that is unlikely to hold. 

The Wigner-Ville transform (WVT) [23] provides a 
spectral profile for each point of the time series, and 
therefore has the advantage of tracking the instantaneous 
changes in frequency and amplitude of each spectral 
component. From each spectrum, we obtained the power by 
integration of the profile of the spectrum in two relevant 
frequency bands: low frequency (LF) from 0.05 Hz to 

0.15 Hz; high frequency (HF), from 0.15 Hz to 0.4 Hz [24]. 
To allow the spectral components to be compared in relative 
terms, the power in these two frequency bands were 
normalized by dividing by the total power. The instant values 
of LF/HF were calculated.

We compared the different measures in REM and NREM 
within each patient group. Statistical comparison between 
means was done using the Student’s t-test. P-values less than 

0.05 were considered statistically significant. The results of 
this comparison are shown in Table I.

Next, we compared the various measures across patient 
groups, showing the discriminatory power of the different 
statistics. The result of this comparison is shown in Table II. 

Finally, using the time-series metrics and the LF/HF 
power ratio as test statistics, the receiver operating 

OSAS severity (see Table I), since apnea events occur 
predominantly during REM sleep. Noise limit was significantly 
increased during apnea episodes. This implies that the 
HRV has a low-dimensional chaotic characteristic, and the 
degree of chaos was pronouncedly enhanced with apnea 
episodes compared to stable breathing. This result is 
consistent with our previous findings [25]. In addition, 
Table I shows that the entropy statistics and the LF/HF ratio 
are less successful in discriminating between REM and 
NREM sleep in OSAS patient groups. 

It is noteworthy that the HRV of the mildly apneic 
subjects mimics that of the severe OSAS patients in terms of 
the nonlinear dynamics; that is, the average chaos intensity, 
as measured by NL, for the mild OSAS group is comparable 
to that of the severe group. This observation makes NL 
suitable for the detection of OSAS, since we can use it to 
identify normal subjects from even the mild OSAS patients. 
However, the numerical-titration technique becomes less 
effective in classifying the severity of apnea. 

3567 



With the Wigner-Ville transform, the LF/HF ratio 
represents the instantaneous relationship between sympathetic 
and parasympathetic modulation. When comparing our 
results with previous studies on spectral analysis of HRV 
during apnea, we can confirm several aspects with our 
results. In particular, there is a significant rise in the LF/HF 
ratio accompanying sleep apnea, reflecting sympathetic 
stimulation and reduction in parasympathetic activity elicited 
by apnea. This finding is consistent with previous studies. 

Approximate entropy and sample entropy measure the 
unpredictability of fluctuations in HRV. Apneic patients 
showed slightly higher ApEn and SampEn which were 
interpreted as a decreased regularity of cardiac rhythm. The 
physiological mechanism underlying enhanced variability is 
not known, but seems likely to represent dysfunction of the 
ANS. In our pediatric data set, the noise is very high; 
therefore the validity of ApEn and SampEn calculations may 
be seriously compromised. Since the RRI time series is also 
non-stationary, little can be inferred from moment statistics 
and entropy calculations. 

In this work, we have calculated the short- and long-range 
correlations (as and al) using DFA. The short range 
correlation is larger than the long-range correlation for all 
subjects. Severe OSAS subjects have lower short time 
scaling exponent (p < 0.05), and higher long range 
correlations (p < 0.02) than normal subjects. For many 
patients, the power law is observed to have more than two 
variations with segment length, suggesting that there may be 
more information in the power-law behavior that was 
overlooked by simply estimating the linear slopes over two 
predefined regions. 

V. CONCLUSION 
We have shown that HRV can be used as a reliable 
indicator of sleep states and as a screening test for pediatric 
sleep apnea. Certain methods of nonlinear dynamics might 
elicit valuable information for physiological interpretation of 
HRV. Since the HRV becomes more chaotic with apnea 
events, cardiac chaos can have diagnostic/prognostic values 
in OSAS screening. 

Some statistics, such as approximate and sample entropy, 
may be too insensitive to detect the nonlinear perturbations 
of R-R interval in pediatric data, or too sensitive to noise, or 
both. More encouraging results have been obtained using 
numerical titration. The robustness of this method to noise 
exhibits tremendous potentials. We conjecture that application 
of nonlinear techniques in conjunction with spectral 
analysis of HRV would provide greater diagnostic accuracy.
