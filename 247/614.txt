ABSTRACT: 
Obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
(OSA) 
is 
a 
major 
public 
health 
problem 
affecting 
approximately 
2% 
to 
3% 
of 
children. 
However, 
snoring, 
the 
cardinal 
symptom 
of 
OSA, 
affects 
at 
least 
5-fold 
more 
children, 
such 
that 
evaluation 
by 
overnight 
polysomnography 
(ONP) 
is 
required 
for 
the 
diagnosis. 
ONP 
is 
laborious, 
expensive, 
and 
relatively 
unavailable 
to 
children. 
Proteomic 
mass 
spectrometry 
coupled 
with 
bioinformatic 
tools 
provide 
valuable 
means 
for 
discovery 
of 
new 
biomarkers 
in 
serum 
for 
a 
variety 
of 
human 
disorders. 
The 
possibility 
exists 
that 
snoring 
children 
with 
and 
without 
OSA 
may 
exhibit 
different 
protein 
expression 
profiles 
in 
serum 
that 
could 
be 
useful 
in 
the 
development 
of 
novel 
diagnostic 
tools 
for 
this 
condition. 
The 
proteomic 
patterns 
of 
20 
children 
with 
OSA 
and 
of 
20 
children 
with 
habitual 
primary 
snoring 
but 
no 
evidence 
of 
OSA 
(HS) 
were 
evaluated 
using 
surface-enhanced 
laser 
desorption/ionization 
timeof-
flight 
mass 
spectrometry 
(SELDI-TOF 
MS). 
Linear 
discriminative 
analysis 
identified 
three 
differentially 
regulated 
proteins 
with 
molecular 
masses 
of 
5896, 
3306, 
6068 
Da 
that 
were 
capable 
of 
diagnosing 
OSA 
with 
93% 
sensitivity 
and 
90% 
specificity. 
Thus, 
the 
proteomic 
signatures 
of 
sera 
from 
children 
with 
OSA 
differ 
from 
those 
of 
HS 
who 
do 
not 
fulfill 
the 
current 
criteria 
for 
treatment. 
Identification 
and 
sequencing 
of 
those 
differentially 
expressed 
proteins 
discovered 
through 
proteomic 
strategies 
may 
lead 
to 
future 
development 
of 
serum-based 
diagnostic 
tests 
for 
OSA 
in 
snoring 
children. 
(Pediatr 
Res

SA 
is 
a 
frequent 
condition 
affecting 
up 
to 
2% 
to 
3% 
of 
all 
children 
and 
is 
associated 
with 
substantial 
neurobehavioral 
and 
cardiovascular 
morbidities 
(1–3). 
In 
the 
United 
States 
alone, 
it 
is 
estimated 
that 
two 
million 
children 
suffer 
from 
OSA. 
However, 
many 
more 
children 
(8%–27%) 
habitually 
snore 
during 
their 
sleep 
and 
are 
at 
risk 
of 
OSA 
(1,2,4 
– 
8). 
Clinical 
history 
and 
physical 
examination 
are 
remarkably 
unpredictive 
in 
the 
differentiation 
between 
OSA 
and 
HS 
(9) 
such 
that 
current 
diagnostic 
approaches 
require 
implementation 
of 
ONP. 
However, 
ONP 
is 
laborious, 
expensive, 
and 
relatively 
unavailable 
to 
children. 
Furthermore, 
ONP 
imposes 
a 
substantial 
burden 
to 
both 
child 
and 
family. 


Proteomic 
mass 
spectrometry 
coupled 
with 
advanced 
bioinformatic 
techniques 
has 
recently 
been 
introduced 
as 
a 
novel 
approach 
for 
developing 
new 
diagnostic 
and 
prognostic 
tools

for 
various 
diseases 
(10,11). 
SELDI-TOF 
MS, 
which 
is 
based 
on 
the 
capture 
of 
proteins/peptides 
on 
chemically 
modified 
surfaces, 
has 
emerged 
as 
a 
specifically 
powerful 
tool 
allowing 
analysis 
of 
complex 
biologic 
samples 
(12,13). 
For 
example, 
SELDI-TOF 
MS 
has 
been 
successfully 
used 
in 
the 
analysis 
of 
serum 
proteins 
to 
reveal 
disease-specific 
“fingerprints” 
or 
“patterns” 
that 
have 
proven 
useful 
in 
the 
early-stage 
detection 
of 
particular 
diseases 
due 
to 
its 
high 
specificity 
and 
sensitivity 
in 
segregating 
diseased 
patients 
from 
those 
without 
disease 
(14–16). 
Furthermore, 
the 
feasibility 
of 
high 
sample 
throughput 
and 
low 
volume 
sample 
requirements 
make 
this 
approach 
particularly 
valuable 
for 
discovery 
of 
new 
disease-specific 
biomarkers 
in 
children. 


In 
this 
study, 
we 
used 
SELDI-TOF 
MS 
strategies 
and 
examined 
sera 
of 
20 
snoring 
children 
with 
OSA 
and 
of 
20 
snoring 
children 
who 
did 
not 
fulfill 
the 
polysomnographic 
criteria 
for 
OSA 
(i.e. 
HS). 


MATERIALS 
AND 
METHODS 


Study 
participants. 
The 
study 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
University 
of 
Louisville 
Human 
Research 
Committee. 
Parental 
informed 
consent 
and 
child 
assent, 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
a 
parent, 
were 
obtained. 
Children 
were 
excluded 
if 
they 
had 
any 
chronic 
medical 
condition, 
psychiatric 
diagnoses, 
or 
any 
genetic 
or 
craniofacial 
syndromes. 


Morning 
serum 
samples 
were 
obtained 
from 
20 
consecutive 
snoring 
children 
fulfilling 
the 
criteria 
for 
OSA 
(see 
below), 
and 
from 
20 
consecutive 
children 
fulfilling 
the 
criteria 
for 
habitual 
snoring 
(HS). 
Their 
ages 
ranged 
between 
3 
and 
12 
y, 
and 
all 
were 
referred 
for 
evaluation 
of 
snoring 
as 
their 
primary 
complaint 
and 
therefore 
underwent 
an 
overnight 
sleep 
study 
at 
the 
Kosair 
Childen’s 
Hospital 
Sleep 
Medicine 
and 
Apnea 
Center. 
Based 
on 
their 
polysomnographic 
findings, 
children 
were 
assigned 
to 
one 
of 
two 
categorical 
groups: 
group 
OSA, 
20 
children 
with 
an 
obstructive 
apnea/hypopnea 
index 
(AHI) 
5 
events/h 
of 
sleep, 
combined 
with 
oxyhemoglobin 
desaturation 
episodes 
(92%) 
and/or 
hypercapnia 
(50 
mm 
Hg), 
and/or 
respiratory 
arousal 
index 
2/hour 
of

and 
group 
HS, 
20 
children 
with 
AHI 
1/h 
of 
sleep 
without 
oxyhemoglobin

and 
with 
a 
respiratory 
arousal

2/h 
of 
sleep. 


Overnight 
polysomnography. 
A 
standard 
overnight 
multichannel 
polysomnographic 
evaluation 
was 
performed 
in 
the 
sleep 
laboratory 
at 
Kosair 
Children’s 
Hospital. 
Children 
were 
studied 
for 
up 
to 
12 
h 
in 
a 
quiet, 
darkened 
room 
with 
an 
ambient 
temperature 
of 
24°C 
in 
the 
company 
of 
one 
of 
their 
parents. 
No 
drugs 
were 
used 
to 
induce 
sleep. 
The 
following 
parameters 
were 
measured: 
chest 
and 
abdominal 
wall 
movement 
by 
respiratory 
impedance 
or 
inductance 
plethysmography 
and 
heart 
rate 
by 
electrocardiography;

end-tidal 
capnograph 
that 
also 
provided 
breath-by-breath 
assessment 
of 
end-tidal 
carbon

levels 
(PETCO2; 
BCI 
SC-300, 
Menomonee 
Falls,

transducer, 
and 
a 
thermistor. 
Arterial 
oxygen 
saturation 
(SpO2) 
was 
assessed 
by 
pulse 
oximetry 
(Nellcor 
N 
100; 
Nellcor 
Inc., 
Hayward,

with 
simultaneous 
recording 
of

waveform. 
The 
bilateral 
electro-oculography, 
eight-channel 
electroencephalography,

electromyography, 
and 
analog 
output 
from 
a 
body 
position 
sensor 
(Braebon 
Medical 
Corporation,

were 
also 
monitored. 
All 
measures 
were 
digitized 
using 
a 
commercially 
available 
polysomnography 
system 
(Rembrandt, 
MedCare 
Diagnostics, 
Amsterdam, 
The 
Netherlands). 
Tracheal 
sound 
was 
monitored 
with 
a 
microphone 
sensor 
(Sleepmate, 
VA) 
and 
a 
digital 
time-synchronized 
video 
recording 
was 
performed. 
Sleep 
architecture 
was 
assessed 
by 
standard 
techniques 
(17). 
The 
proportion 
of 
time 
spent 
in 
rapid 
eye 
movement 
(REM) 
sleep 
was 
expressed 
as 
the 
percentage 
of 
total 
sleep 
time 
(TST). 
The 
obstructive 
apnea 
index 
(AI) 
was 
defined 
as 
the 
number 
of 
apneas 
episodes 
per 
hour 
of 
TST. 
Obstructive 
apnea 
was 
defined 
as 
the 
absence 
of 
airflow 
with 
continued 
chest 
wall 
and 
abdominal 
movement 
for 
duration 
of 
at 
least 
two 
breaths 
(18,19). 
Hypopnea 
was 
defined 
as 
a 
decrease 
in 
nasal 
flow 
of 
50% 
with 
a 
corresponding 
decrease 
in 
SpO2 
of 
4% 
and/or 
arousal 
(19). 
The 
apnea/hypopnea 
index 
(AHI) 
was 
defined 
as 
the 
number 
of 
apnea 
and 
hypopnea 
episodes 
per 
hour 
of 
TST. 
Children 
with 
an 
AHI 
1/h 
TST 
were 
considered 
to 
have 
habitual 
snoring 
(HS), 
while 
children 
with 
AHI 
5/h 
TST 
were 
considered 
to 
have 
OSA.

were 
recorded. 
Since 
criteria 
for 
arousals 
have 
not 
yet 
been 
developed 
for

report 
(20) 
using 
the 
3-s

(21). 
Arousals 
were 
divided 
into 
two 
subtypes: 
spontaneous 
arousals 
and 
respiratory 
arousals.

If 
the 
matrix 
peaks 
were 
missing 
or 
depressed 
below 
a 
30%

the 
spectra 
were 
eliminated 
from 
final

were 
calibrated 
and 
normalized 
according 
to 
the 
manufacturer’s

were 
detected 
using 
the

was 
generated 
for 
each

of 
20 
children 
with

and 
20

Both 
groups 
were 
comparable 
for 
age, 
gender, 
and 
body

The 
OSA 
group 
had 
higher 
mean

and 
arousal 
index, 
with 
lower 
SaO2

and 
similar

(Table

The

range 
of 
0–2000 
Da 
was 
eliminated 
from 
data 
analysis 
because 
of 
interference 
by 
matrix 
peaks. 
To 
identify 
serum 
biomarkers 
capable 
of 
distinguishing 
the 
children 
with 
OSA 
from 
HS 
but 
no 
evidence 
of 
OSA, 
we 
constructed 
a 
decision-tree 
classification 
algorithm 
using 
over 
100 
peaks 
within 
the 
2000-to 
40,000-Da 
range. 
The 
classification 
algorithm 
was 
developed 
using 
the 
cross-
validation 
technique 
included 
in 
the 
BPS 
software 
and 
involved 
three 
nodes 
with 
distinct 
masses 
(5896, 
3306, 
6068 
Da) 
as 
shown 
in 
Figure

and

The 
discriminatory 
peaks 
were 
able 
to 
efficiently 
distinguish 
17 
of 
18 
(94%) 
children 
with 
OSA 
and 
20 
of 
20 
(100%) 
HS 
without 
OSA 
(Table

In 
the 
test 
group 
of 
the 
cross-validation, 
15 
of 
18 
(83%) 
OSA 
children 
and 
18

20

We 
found 
eight 
proteins 
in 
the 
database 
in 
the 
specified 
pI/molecular 
mass 
ranges. 
Of 
the 
eight 
candidate 
proteins, 
seven 
were 
from 
the 
family 
of 
Gag 
polyproteins 
belonging 
to 
the 
human 
immunodeficiency 
virus 
(HIV). 
The 
chance 
of 
the 
identity 
of 
this 
protein 
being 
a 
HIV 
protein 
present 
in 
serum 
samples 
from 
almost 
all 
OSA 
children 
and 
being 
absent 
in 
all 
non-OSA 
subjects 
is 
highly 
unlikely. 
The 
most 
likely 
candidate 
is 
osteocalcin 
precursor 
(gamma-carboxyglutamic 
acid 
containing 
protein) 
with 
a 
molecular 
mass 
of 
5799.49 
and 
a 
pI 


4.40. 
This 
protein 
constitutes 
1% 
to 
2% 
of 
the 
total 
bone 
protein. 
It 
binds 
strongly 
to 
apatite 
and 
calcium. 
The 
calcium 
binding 
requires 
gamma-carboxyglutamate 
residues 
that 
are 
formed 
by 
vitamin 
K–dependent 
carboxylation 
(22). 
DISCUSSION 


The 
major 
findings 
of 
the 
present 
study 
indicate 
that 
among 
snoring 
children, 
those 
with 
clearly 
defined 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
and 
who 
require 
referral 
for 
treatment 
can 
be 
accurately 
differentiated 
using 
the 
differential 
expression 
of 
a 
selected 
number 
of 
proteins 
in 
their 
morning 
serum 
samples 
from 
snoring 
children 
who 
are 
not 
currently 
considered 
as 
candidates 
for 
therapy 
(23). 


Before 
we 
discuss 
the 
potential 
significance 
of 
our 
findings, 
some 
technical 
issues 
deserve 
comment. 
First, 
serum 
samples 
have 
been 
previously 
used 
in 
the 
discovery 
process 
of 
novel 
biomarkers 
using 
protein 
mass 
spectrometry 
techniques 
(24 
– 
27). 
Indeed, 
SELDI 
approaches 
offer 
a 
sensitive 
alternative 
to 
two-dimensional 
polyacrylamide 
gel 
electrophoresis 
for 
discovering 
of 
disease-associated 
proteins. 
The 
process 
of 
SELDI 
involves 
purified 
or 
partially 
purified 
proteins 
mixed 
with 


EAMs, 
a 
crystal-forming 
matrix, 
placed 
on 
an 
inert 
metal 
target, 
and 
subjected 
to 
a 
pulsed 
laser 
beam 
to 
produce 
gas 
phase 
ions 
that 
traverse 
a 
field-free 
flight 
tube 
and 
then 
are 
separated 
according 
to 
their 
mass-dependent 
velocities 
(28). 
Particular 
precautions 
were 
taken 
to 
standardize 
the 
timing 
of 
serum 
collection 
and 
the 
demographic 
characteristics 
of 
the 
study 
groups. 
Indeed, 
the 
two 
groups 
did 
not 
differ 
in 
age, 
gender, 
or 
body 
mass 
index. 
Furthermore, 
we 
specifically 
selected 
snoring 
children 
who 
fulfilled 
the 
currently 
accepted 
criteria 
for 
surgical 
removal 
of 
tonsils 
and 
adenoids 
and 
compared 
them 
with 
children 
who, 
despite 
having 
habitual 
snoring 
and 
being 
referred 
for 
evaluation 
by 
their 
primary 
care 
physicians, 
would 
not 
be 
viewed 
as 
requiring 
any 
therapeutic 
intervention 
based 
on 
their 
polysomnographic 
findings. 
We 
believe 
that 
this 
approach 
is 
more 
realistic 
and 
appropriate 
in 
the 
usual 
clinical 
contextual 
setting 
than 
using 
asymptomatic, 
nonsnoring 
controls. 
Therefore, 
the 
current 
findings 
should 
be 
highly 
relevant 
to 
the 
identification 
of 
snoring 
children 
who 
have 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
and 
who 
require 
more 
extensive 
evaluation 
and 
treatment. 
Finally, 
the 
software-driven 
approach 
taken 
for 
tentative 
identification 
of 
the 
proteins 
corresponding 
to 
the 
peaks 
associated 
with 
predictive 
value 
in 
OSA 
is 
clearly 
only 
an 
initial 
step 
in 
such 
efforts 
and 
will 
require 
more 
extensive 
affinity-based 
column 
purification 
of 
large 
sample 
volumes 
of 
pooled 
serum 
samples 
followed 
by 
tandem 
mass 
spectrometry 
(29). 


The 
analytical 
algorithms 
used 
to 
detect 
selective 
patterns 
of 
serum 
protein 
expression 
were 
capable 
of 
reliably 
differentiating 
between 
OSA 
and 
HS 
while 
using 
a 
restricted 
number 
of 
spectral 
peaks. 
Obviously, 
verification 
of 
the 
validity 
of 
such 
approach 
will 
require 
prospective 
and 
unbiased 
testing 
of 
a 
large 
cohort 
of 
snoring 
children 
with 
and 
without 
the 
diagnosis 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
in 
several 
pediatric 
sleep 
centers. 
Such 
study 
is 
clearly 
beyond 
the 
scope 
of 
the 
current 
work. 
However, 
our 
current 
findings 
confirm 
the 
initial 
hypothesis 
that 
OSA, 
possibly 
via 
altered 
gas 
exchange 
and 
sleep 
fragmentation, 
leads 
to 
alteration 
of 
a 
selective 
group 
of 
proteins 
in 
the 
morning 
serum 
and 
that 
such 
proteins 
can 
then 
be 
potentially 
used 
as 
a 
diagnostic 
biomarker 
for 
the 
disease. 
We 
have 
previously 
shown 
that 
serum 
levels 
of 
vascular 
endothelial 
growth 
factor 
are 
increased 
in 
pediatric 
patients 
with 
sleep 
apnea 
and 
that 
the 
magnitude 
of 
such 
increase 
correlates 
with 
disease 
severity 
(30). 
However, 
use 
of 
this 
single 
protein 
as 
a 
biomarker 
was 
ineffective, 
with 
no 
improvement 
in 
the 
likelihood 
ratios 
of 
diagnosing 
OSA 
compared 
with 
history 
and 
physical 
examination 
alone 
(30). 




PROTEIN 
PATTERNS 
IN 
SNORING 
CHILDREN 



Figure

Representative 
spectra 
from 
the 
serum 
of 
three 
children 
with 
OSA 
(A) 
and 
from 
three 
children 
with 
habitual 
snoring 
(B). 
A 
peak 
is 
clearly 
recognizable 
at 
a 
molecular 
mass 
5900 
Da 
in 
all 
OSA 
subjects 
and 
is 
absent 
in 
all 
HS 
children. 


Of 
the 
three 
proteins 
identified 
in 
our 
analysis, 
we 
further 
analyzed 
the 
putative 
and 
clearly 
visible 
biomarker 
discovered 
at 
m/z 
5896 
using 
the 
Swiss-Prot 
database. 
This 
approach, 
which 
constitutes 
a 
preliminary 
and 
tentative 
biodiscovery 
exercise, 
suggested 
that 
a 
likely 
identity 
of 
this 
OSA-regulated 
spectrum 
may 
correspond 
to 
osteocalcin. 
Osteocalcin 
is 
a 
precursor 
of 
gamma-carboxyglutamic 
acid–containing 
protein 
and 
is 
also 
known 
as 
bone 
Gla 
protein. 
This 
protein 
is 
an 
important 
marker 
of 
bone 
turnover 
in 
physiologic 
and 
pathologic 
conditions 
(31) 
and 
has 
been 
widely 
studied 
as 
a 
biomarker 
for 
bone 
loss, 
growth 
retardation 
(32), 
osteosarcoma 
(33), 
and 
renal 
osteodystrophy 
(34). 
Previous 
studies 
have 
shown 
increased 
serum 
osteocalcin 
in 
diseases 
with 
increased 
bone 
turnover, 
e.g. 
renal 
osteodystrophy, 
hyperparathyroidism, 
hyperthyroidism, 
and 
Paget’s 
disease 
(35,36) 
and 
decreased 
concentrations 
with 
low 
bone 
turnover, 
e.g. 
hypoparathyroidism, 
hypercalcemia 
resulting 
from 
bone 
metastases, 
and 
long-
term 
corticosteroid 
therapy, 
the 
latter 
reflecting 
a 
decrease 
in 
the 
osteoblastic 
activity 
(37). 
While 
the 
role 
of 
osteocalcin 
changes 
in 
children 
with 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
remains 
to 
be 
established, 
Colle 
and 
colleagues 
(38) 
identified 
increased 
nocturnal 
osteocalcin 
levels 
among 
children 
with 
growth 
retardation, 
possibly 
as 
a 
compensatory 
response. 
There 
is 
now 
a 
substantial 
body 
of 
evidence 
supporting 
a 
causal 
relationship 
between 
stunted 
somatic 
growth 
and 
OSA 
in 
children. 
Indeed, 
growth 
retardation 
is 
a 
frequent 
observation 
in 
children 
with 
OSA, 
even 
when 
they 
are 
obese 
(39) 
and 
has 
been 
attributed 
to 
increased 
energy 
expenditure 
during 
sleep 
(40,41) 
as 
well 
as 
to 
alterations 
in 
the 
regulation 
of 
insulin 
growth 
factor 
and 
its 
binding 
proteins 
(42). 
In 
the 
present 
study, 
we 
also 
observed 
that 
osteocalcin 
was 
consistently 
increased 
in 
serum 
of 
OSA 
patients, 
and 
this 
increase 
could 
reflect 
a 
compensatory 
phenomenon 
to 
the 
growth 
deceleration 
imposed 
by 
the 
episodic 
asphyxic 
events 
associated 
with 
recurrent 
upper 
airway 
obstruction. 
Of 
note, 
use 
of 
alternative 
search 
strategies 
for 
the 
three 
putative 
candidate 
biomarker 
peaks 
yielded 
several 
potential 
proteins 
whose 
function 
or 
expression 
appears 
to 
be 
regulated 
by 
stress. 
Examples 
of 
such 
candidates 
include 
corticotropin, 
lipotropin, 
and 
melanotropin. 
Obviously, 
extensive 
alternative 
techniques 
such 
as 
LC-MS-MS 
approaches 
and 
greatly 
expanded 
number 


of 
subjects 
will 
be 
needed 
to 
definitively 
identify 
these 
proteins 
as 
disease-related 
biomarkers 
and 
their 
roles 
in 
OSA. 


In 
conclusion, 
proteomic 
profiling 
of 
serum 
samples 
in 
children 
with 
OSA 
revealed 
differential 
expression 
of 
circulating 
proteins 
that 
may 
provide 
useful 
future 
diagnostic 
approaches. 
Indeed, 
while 
prospective, 
large-scale 
studies 
will 
be 
required 
to 
confirm 
whether 
the 
currently 
discovered 
proteomic 
pattern 
can 
dependably 
differentiate 
between 
HS 
and 
OSA, 
such 
an 
approach 
coupled 
with 
definitive 
identification 
of 
the 
differentially 
expressed 
proteins 
will 
provide 
the 
opportunity 
for 
developing 
clinically 
applicable 
antibody-based 
diagnostic 
assays 
in 
pediatric
