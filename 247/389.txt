Objectives/Hypothesis: 
Children 
with 
sleep-
disordered 
breathing 
may 
experience 
behavioral 
and 
learning 
problems 
such 
as 
inattentiveness 
and 
hyperactivity. 
The 
aim 
of 
this 
study 
was 
to 
measure 
the 
impact 
of 
adenotonsillectomy 
on 
sleep-related 
adverse 
events 
and 
behavioral 
problems 
in 
children 
with 
sleep-disordered 
breathing. 
Method: 
This 
prospective 
and 
interventional 
study 
enrolled 
40 
sleep-
disordered 
breathing 
children 
(mean 
age, 
8.4 
. 
1.6 
years) 
with 
hypertrophic 
tonsils 
and 
adenoids. 
All 
patients 
completed 
two 
polysomnographies, 
tests 
of 
variables 
of 
attention 
(TOVAs), 
and 
Child 
Behavior 
Checklists, 
one 
at 
baseline 
and 
the 
other 
6 
months 
after 
adenotonsillectomy. 
Results: 
The 
apnea–hypopnea 
index 
(P 
< 
.001), 
TOVA 
scores 
(P 
< 
.001), 
and 
8 
of 
9 
individual 
domains 
of 
the 
Child 
Behavior 
Checklist 
scores 
(P 
< 
.05) 
significantly 
improved 
after 
surgery. 
However, 
the 
change 
in 
the 
apnea–hypopnea 
index 
was 
not 
negatively 
correlated 
with 
TOVA 
score 
(r 
. 
#0.17, 
P 
. 
.38). 
Conclusion: 
Adenotonsillectomy 
could 
significantly 
improve 
behavior 
(TOVA) 
scores, 
but 
the 
improvement 
may 
not 
simply 
be 
attributable 
to 
changes 
in 
sleep 
apnea 
events.

cause 
of 
SDB 
in 
children 
is 
predominantly 
associated 
with 
tonsillar 
and 
adenoid 
hypertrophy 
leading 
to 
airway 
obstruction 
during 
sleep.2 
The 
symptoms 
of 
SDB 
include 
snoring, 
breathing 
cessation, 
difficulty 
breathing, 
restless 
sleep, 
frequent 
awakening, 
and 
behavior 
disturbances.2 
There 
are 
some 
very 
important 
differences 
in 
clinical 
presentation 
of 
SDB 
between 
children 
and 
adults.3 
Children 
for 
the 
most 
part 
do 
not 
present 
with 
excessive 
daytime 
somnolence, 
but 
more 
often 
display 
“daytime 
externalizing 
behavior” 
such 
as 
hyperactivity, 
rebellious 
behavior, 
aggressiveness, 
social 
withdrawal, 
and 
learning 
difficulties.4 


Recent 
studies 
have 
suggested 
an 
association 
between 
behavioral 
problems 
and 
SDB 
in 
children.5–7 
In 
addition, 
learning 
and 
behavioral 
problems 
in 
some 
children 
with 
sleep 
apnea 
improved 
significantly 
after 
tonsillectomy 
and 
adenoidectomy.7,8 
However, 
these 
studies 
merely 
used 
questionnaires, 
intelligence 
tests, 
or 
school 
grades, 
which 
may 
be 
susceptible 
to 
subjective 
bias, 
to 
assess 
the 
children’s 
behavior. 


The 
test 
of 
variables 
of 
attention 
(TOVA) 
is 
a 
computerized 
continuous 
performance 
test 
to 
measure 
inattention 
and 
impulsivity 
with 
minimal 
language 
demands, 
and 
has 
no 
learning 
effect 
on 
repeated 
administration 
of 
the 
test 
and 
no 
effect 
on 
left–right 
discrimination.9 
The 
test–retest 
reliability 
of 
TOVA 
to 
determine 
the 
effects 
of 
stimulants 
and 
depressants 
on 
cognitive 
performance 
has 
been 
shown 
and 
used 
as 
part 
of 
an 
ancillary 
test 
for 
the 
diagnosis 
of 
attention 
deficit 
hyperactivity 
disorder 
(ADHD) 
in 
children 
over 
5 
years 
of 
age.10,11 
Additionally, 
it 
has 
been 
used 
to 
evaluate 
response 
to 
pharmacotherapy 
and 
monitor 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
surgery 
in 
children 
with 


ADHD.12,13 


The 
Child 
Behavior 
Checklist 
(CBCL) 
was 
developed 
to 
evaluate 
children’s 
competencies 
and 
behavioral 
and 
emotional 
problems 
and 
has 
been 
widely 
used 
in 
research 
and 
clinical 
practice.14 


To 
the 
best 
of 
our 
knowledge, 
this 
is 
the 
first 
study 
to 
use 
two 
objective 
measures 
(TOVA 
and 
polysomnography) 
to 
examine 
postoperative 
change 
in 
pediatric 
behavior 
and 
SDB. 
The 
aim 
of 
this 
study 
was 
therefore 
to 
assess 
the 
relationship 
between 
postoperative 
change 
in 
sleep-
related 
impairment 
and 
in 
ADHD 
score 
and 
to 
determine

MATERIALS 
AND 
METHODS 


Subjects 


The 
series 
comprised 
40 
consecutive 
children 
referred 
to 
our 
otolaryngology 
department 
because 
of 
snoring, 
apneic 
episodes, 
or 
dyspnea 
for 
more 
than 
6 
months. 
All 
patients 
received 
a 
complete 
otolaryngologic 
examination, 
lateral-view 
skull 
x-ray, 
and 
overnight 
polysomnography 
in 
a 
sleep 
laboratory. 
Only 
subjects 
with 
hypertrophic 
tonsils 
(Friedman’s 
grade 
2. 
or 
more15) 
and 
adenoid 
vegetation 
demonstrated 
on 
the 
lateral 
view 
skull 
x-ray 
were 
recruited. 
Children 
with 
neuromuscular 
disorders, 
craniofacial 
syndromes, 
and 
psychiatric 
disorders 
were 
excluded. 
Five 
children 
who 
met 
the 
entry 
criteria 
were 
excluded 
because 
their 
parents 
refused 
psychometric 
assessment. 


To 
assess 
their 
ADHD 
status, 
children 
with 
SDB 
were 
referred 
to 
our 
psychiatry 
department. 
The 
diagnosis 
of 
ADHD 
was 
established 
by 
an 
experienced 
psychiatrist 
based 
on 
clinical 
symptoms 
and 
history 
according 
to 
Diagnostic 
and 
Statistical 
Manual 
of 
Mental 
Disorders, 
Fourth 
Edition 
(DSM-IV) 
criteria.16 
All 
children 
with 
SDB 
received 
psychometric 
assessment 
using 
TOVA 
and 
CBCL. 


Sleep 
Study 


Standard 
overnight 
polysomnography 
(PSG; 
Nicolet 
Ultra-
Som 
System, 
Madison, 
WI, 
USA), 
including 
video 
recording, 
was 
performed 
in 
a 
conventional 
manner 
to 
document 
sleep 
parameters 
and 
architecture 
in 
every 
child 
at 
baseline 
and 
6 
months 
after 
surgery. 
At 
the 
time 
of 
the 
recording, 
all 
children 
were 
free 
of 
any 
drug 
for 
at 
least 
9 
days 
and 
one 
parent 
was 
present 
on 
the 
premises. 
The 
parameters 
used 
in 
this 
study 
were 
apnea–hypopnea 
index 
(AHI), 
snoring 
index 
(SI), 
and 
minimal 
oxygen 
saturation 
(MSAT). 
AHI 
was 
defined 
as 
the 
number 
of 
apneas 
and 
hypopneas 
per 
hour 
of 
total 
sleep 
time. 
Apnea 
in 
children 
was 
defined 
as 
absence 
of 
airflow 
with 
continued 
chest 
wall 
and 
abdominal 
wall 
movement 
for 
duration 
longer 
than 
two 
breaths,17 
whereas 
obstructive 
hypopneas 
were 
defined 
as 
a 
decrease 
in 
nasal 
flow 
between 
30% 
and 
80% 
from 
baseline 
with 
a 
corresponding 
decrease 
in 
SpO2 
of 
3% 
and/or 
arousal.18 
An 
AHI 
"1 
event 
per 
hour 
in 
children 
was 
considered 
elevated. 
SI 
was 
defined 
as 
the 
number 
of 
spikes 
in 
sound 
intensity 
exceeding 
50 
dB 
per 
hour 
of 
sleep. 
MSAT 
was 
defined 
as 
the 
minimal 
O2 
saturation 
detected 
during 
the 
PSG 
test 
period. 
The 
psychiatrist 
who 
diagnosed 
ADHD 
was 
blind 
to 
the 
PSG 
results. 


Test 
of 
Variables 
of 
Attention 


The 
TOVA 
is 
a 
nonverbal, 
computer-generated 
and 
computer-scored 
test. 
The 
subject 
is 
asked 
to 
rapidly 
differentiate 
between 
the 
target 
stimulus 
and 
nontarget 
stimulus, 
i.e., 
two 
easily 
differentiated 
geometric 
pictures 
centered 
on 
a 
computer 
screen.19 
Only 
one 
stimulus 
appears 
at 
a 
time 
and 
the 
frequency 
of 
their 
appearance 
is 
set 
by 
a 
randomly 
determined 
ratio. 
The 
subject 
is 
instructed 
to 
respond 
by 
pressing 
a 
handheld 
button 
immediately 
after 
seeing 
a 
target 
and 
to 
not 
respond 
to 
a 
nontarget 
(Fig. 
1). 
The 
test 
is 
divided 
into 
four 
quarters 
of 
approximately 
5 
minutes 
each. 
The 
first 
two 
quarters 
(the 
boring 
session 
used 
to 
evaluate 
attention) 
have 
more 
nontarget 
components, 
whereas 
the 
last 
two 
quarters 
(the 
stimulating 
session 
used 
to 
evaluate 
impulsivity) 
have 
more 
target 
components. 
The 
TOVA 
must 
be 
completed 
in 
22.6 
minutes. 
All 
tests 
were 
performed 
in 
a 
specially 
designed 
testing 
room 
to 
minimize 
variability 
in 
testing 
conditions. 
The 
TOVA 
indices 
include: 
1) 
omissions 
(failure 
to 
respond 
to 
the 
target), 
commonly 
interpreted 
as 
a 
measure 
of 
attention; 
2) 
commissions 
(inappropriately 
responding 
to 
the 
nontargets),

as 
a 
measure

3) 
response 
time 
(time 
used 
to

to 
each 
trial), 
a 
measure 
of 
response 
latency; 
4) 
response 
time 
variability 
(standard 
deviation 
[SD] 
of 
the 
mean 
response 
time), 
a 
measure 
of 
the 
inconsistency 
in 
response 
times; 
5) 
D’ 
(ratio 
of 
hit 
frequency 
to 
frequency 
of 
false 
response), 
a 
measure 
of 
perceptual 
sensitivity 
(the 
ability 
to 
distinguish 
target 
from 
nontarget 
stimuli); 
and 
6) 
ADHD 
score 
(the 
total 
of 
subscores), 
a 
measure 
of 
the 
similarity 
between 
performance 
and 
ADHD 
symptomatology. 
The 
TOVA 
scores, 
compared 
with 
those 
of 
the 
normal 
same-age, 
same-gender, 
and 
average 
IQ 
group, 
are 
reported 
as 
SDs. 
Normal 
score 
range 
is 
between 
#1.00 
and 
1.00. 
The 
more 
negative 
the 
SD, 
the

Child 
Behavior 
Checklist 


The 
CBCL 
is 
a 
questionnaire 
for 
parents 
and 
parent 
surrogates 
specifically 
designed 
to 
evaluate 
social 
and 
behavioral 
competence 
(depression/anxiety, 
thought/obsession, 
somatic 
complaints, 
social 
withdrawal, 
hyperactivity, 
aggressive 
behavior, 
and 
delinquent 
behavior) 
in 
children 
between 
4 
years 
and 
18 
years 
of 
age.14 
Each 
item 
is 
scored

not 
true; 
1, 
somewhat 
or 
sometimes 
true; 
or 
2, 
very

Surgical 
Technique 


Tonsillectomy 
was 
performed 
using 
a 
dissection 
and 
electrocautery 
technique 
with 
suturing 
of 
tonsillar 
pillar. 
Adenoidal 
tissue 
was 
removed 
using 
curettes 
under 
indirect 
mirror 
visualization. 
All 
surgery 
was 
implemented 
by 
the 
author 
(H.-Y.L.) 
or 
residents 
supervised 
by 
the 
author. 


Outcome 
Measurements 


Change 
in 
ADHD 
score 
after 
tonsillectomy 
and 
adenoidectomy 
and 
the 
association 
between 
postoperative 
ADHD 
score 
and 
AHI 
were 
the 
primary 
outcome 
measures. 
Other 
outcomes 
included 
changes 
in 
polysomnographic 
indices 
(e.g., 
AHI, 
SI, 
MSAT) 
and 
CBCL 
(Fig. 
2). 
The 
final 
sample 
size 
of 
40 
was 
shown 
from 
a 
post 
hoc 
analysis 
to 
provide 
88% 
power 
at 
the 
0.05 
significance 
level. 
Informed 
consent 
was 
obtained 
from 
all 
parents. 
The 
Institutional 
Review 
Board 
of 
the 
Chang 
Gung 
Memorial 
Hospital 
approved 
the 
study. 


Statistical 
Analysis 


Continuous 
variables 
at 
baseline 
and 
outcome 
were 
compared 
by 
paired 
t 
test. 
Variables 
that 
were 
not 
normally 
distributed 
were 
compared 
using 
the 
Wilcoxon 
signed-rank 
test 
for 
paired 
data. 
The 
Pearson 
correlation 
coefficient 
was 
used 
to 
compare 
the 
changes 
of 
AHI 
and 
ADHD 
scores. 
Results 
are 
expressed 
as

DISCUSSION 


Early 
study 
demonstrated 
a 
high 
prevalence 
(28%) 
of 
abnormal 
behavior 
in 
children 
who 
underwent 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
SDB.21 
Our 
early 
study 
revealed 
that 
56.8% 
(50 
of 
88) 
of 
children 
with 
ADHD 
had 
an 
AHI 
"1 
event 
per 
hour, 
and 
19.3% 
had 
an 
AHI 
"5 
events 
per 
hour.22 
In 
this 
cohort, 
ADHD 
was 
diagnosed 
in 
40% 
(16 
of 
40) 
of 
children 
with 
SDB 
who 
underwent 
adenotonsillectomy. 
This 
high 
percentage 
of 
ADHD 
in 
children 
with 
SDB 
suggested 
an 
association 
between 
SDB 
and 
behavioral 
problems. 
Accordingly, 
we 
referred 
children 
with 
SDB 
to 
our 
psychiatry 
department 
for 
evaluation 
of 
possible 
behavioral 
disturbances. 


The 
major 
cause 
of 
SDB 
in 
children 
is 
enlarged 
tonsils 
and 
adenoids, 
and 
consequently 
adenotonsillectomy 
is 
the 
most 
common 
surgery 
implemented 
for 
SDB 
in 
children. 
Swen 
et 
al.23 
reported 
a 
significant 
improvement 
in 
AHI 
and 
MSAT 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
in 
24 
children 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea, 
but 
children 
with 
severe 
respiratory 
disturbance 
index 
still 
had 
many 
apneic 
events 
after 
surgery. 
Guilleminault 
and 
colleagues24 
reported 
that 
children 
with 
SDB 
could 
achieve 
significant 
improvement 
in 
both 
clinical 
symptoms 
and 
PSG 
findings 
through 
complete 
adenotonsillectomy. 
Additionally, 
the 
authors 
advocated 
suturing 
of 
the 
tonsillar 
pillars 
after 
tonsillectomy 
to 
tighten 
and 
enlarge 
the 
upper 
airway. 
In 
this 
study, 
complete 
adenotonsillectomy 
and 
tonsillar 
pillar 
suturing 
were 
performed 
to 
maximize 
surgical 
outcome, 
and 
PSG 
showed 
a 
reduction 
of 
84.0% 
in 
mean 
AHI 
from 
10.6 
$11.1 
per 
hour 
to 
1.7 
$2.1 
per 
hour 
(P 
%.001). 
These 
results 
and 
similar 
previously 
reported 
results 
indicate 
that 
adenotonsillectomy 
was 
a 
highly 
efficacious 
procedure 
in 
treating 
sleep-related 
adverse 
events 
in 
children. 
Persistence 
of 
residual 
snoring 
in 
children 
with 
SDB 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
may 
be 
partially 
attributable 
to 
widespread 
existence 
of 
nasal 
allergy 
in 
children 
in 
our 


Laryngoscope

country; 
moreover, 
this 
demonstrates 
the 
limitations 
of 
this 
operation 
and 
indicates 
the 
need 
for 
multidisciplinary 
evaluations 
and 
treatment.25 


CBCL 
is 
a 
well-validated 
screening 
measure 
of 
children’s 
behavior 
problems 
and 
is 
widely 
used 
in 
comparative 
studies. 
Goldstein8 
reported 
that 
all 
but 
two 
(total 
competence 
and 
social 
problems) 
of 
the 
individual 
syndrome 
scales 
improved 
significantly 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
with 
a 
reduction 
of 
7.3 
points 
in 
the 
mean 
total 
problems 
score. 
Avior 
et 
al.13 
noted 
a 
significant 
change 
in 
mean 
CBCL 
score 
after 
adenotonsillectomy. 
In 
this 
study, 
all 
but 
one 
(aggressive 
behavior) 
achieved 
significant 
improvement 
postoperatively. 
These 
results 
indicate 
a 
concomitant 
improvement 
in 
attention-related 
symptoms 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
children 
with 
SDB 
and 
suggest 
that 
attention 
and 
behavior 
problems 
should 
be 
regarded 
as 
an 
indication 
for 
surgery 
in 
children 
with 
SDB. 


TOVA 
has 
been 
used 
for 
monitoring 
medication 
effectiveness 
on 
cognitive 
performance.12 
Avior 
et 
al.13 
reported 
that 
the 
mean 
TOVA 
score 
improved 
significantly 
from 
#2.9 
$3.1 
to 
#0.4 
$2.8 
after 
adenotonsillectomy. 
In 
this 
study, 
mean 
ADHD 
score 
improved 
from 
#1.49 
. 


1.98 
to 
0.08 
$2.13 
after 
surgery 
(P 
%.001). 
This 
provides 
an 
objective 
basis 
for 
choosing 
adenotonsillectomy 
to 
treat 
inattention 
in 
children 
with 
SDB. 
Additionally, 
the 
ADHD 
scores 
of 
18 
of 
26 
children 
(69%), 
which 
were 
below 
normal 
preoperatively, 
increased 
into 
the 
normal 
range 
postoperatively. 
This 
may 
suggest 
the 
existence 
of 
two 
types 
of 
ADHD 
(primary 
ADHD 
and 
SDB-related 
ADHD) 
and 
consequently 
that 
before 
long-term 
drug 
therapy 
is 
administered, 
consultation 
of 
an 
otolaryngologist 
should 
be 
sought 
to 
identify 
potential 
enlargement 
of 
tonsils 
and 
adenoids 
and 
to 
assess 
the 
need 
for 
adenotonsillectomy 
by 
SDB-
related 
ADHD 
individuals. 
The 
ADHD 
scores 
of 
8 
of 
26 
children 
(31%) 
remained 
below 
normal 
postoperatively. 
Furthermore, 
there 
were 
no 
parallel 
improvements 
in 
AHI 
and 
ADHD 
score 
(r 
&#0.17, 
P 
&.38). 
These 
indicate 
that 
the 
inattention 
and 
behavioral 
problems 
could 
not 
be 
completely 
resolved 
by 
surgery 
in 
every 
child 
with 
SDB-
related 
ADHD. 
Thus, 
inattention 
and 
abnormal 
behaviors 
in 
children 
with 
SDB 
cannot 
be 
attributed 
to 
apnea 
alone. 
Some 
sociodemographic 
factors, 
including 
parental 
education, 
marriage 
status, 
family 
income, 
and 
aboriginal 
or 
nonaboriginal 
ethnicity, 
may 
influence 
children’s 
inattention 
and 
performance. 
Response 
time 
was 
shown 
to 
be 
longer 
in 
patients 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
than 
normal 
subjects, 
and 
treatment 
with 
nasal 
continuous 
airway 
positive 
pressure 
in 
patients 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
proved 
to 
be 
effective 
in 
shortening 
their 
response 
time.26 
In 
this 
study, 
response 
time 
was 
significantly 
truncated 
from 
#0.79 
. 


1.14 
to 
#0.28 
$0.93 
(P 
&.006) 
after 
surgery 
(consistent 
with 
previous 
reports) 
and 
suggested 
that 
the 
response 
latency 
of 
patients 
with 
SDB 
might 
improve 
after 
adequate 
treatment 
(either 
with 
continuous 
airway 
positive 
pressure 
or 
surgery) 
of 
their 
adverse 
respiratory 
events. 
Omission 
errors, 
commission 
errors, 
response 
time 
variability, 
and 
D’ 
tended 
to 
improve, 
but 
not 
significantly, 
after 
surgery. 
This 
may 
be 
partially 
attributed 
to 
small 
sample 
size. 
Further 
study 
will 
be 
needed. 
One 
limitation 
of 
our 
study 
is 
the 
lack 
of 
a 
control 


Laryngoscope 
116: 
July

1146 


group 
to 
investigate 
the 
effect 
of 
natural 
history 
(in 
some 
cases, 
behavior 
may 
improve 
as 
the 
child 
develops). 
However, 
each 
child 
was 
used 
as 
his 
or 
her 
own 
control 
for 
comparative 
analysis, 
and 
not 
only 
subjective, 
but 
also 
objective 
measures 
found 
that 
the 
child’s 
behavior 
improved. 
Therefore, 
we 
think 
that 
our 
results 
adequately 
support 
our 
conclusion. 
Another 
limitation 
is 
the 
small 
sample 
size, 
which 
made 
further 
analysis 
of 
the 
probable 
cause 
of 
ADHD 
impossible. 
To 
further 
investigate 
the 
relationship 
between 
ADHD 
and 
SDB, 
we 
are 
now 
conducting 
a 
longitudinal 
study 
to 
follow 
the 
prevalence 
of 
SDB 
in 
children 
with 
ADHD 
and 
the 
impact 
of 
adenotonsillectomy 
on 
this 
population. 


CONCLUSION 


The 
results 
of 
this 
study 
suggest 
that 
surgical 
treatment 
of 
children 
with 
SDB 
leads 
to 
measurable 
improvements 
in 
behavior. 
The 
use 
of 
TOVA 
provides 
an 
objective 
way 
to 
assess 
the 
response 
to 
clinical 
treatment. 
Our 
data 
did 
not 
show 
a 
dose–response 
effect 
linking 
improvements 
in 
sleep 
apnea 
and 
behavior. 
Further 
investigation 
will 
be 
needed 
to 
define 
the 
spectrum 
of 
ADHD 
(primary 
ADHD 
versus 
SDB-related 
ADHD) 
and 
the 
contribution 
of 
SDB 
to 
ADHD.
