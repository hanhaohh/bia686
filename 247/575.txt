ABSTRACT. Objective. Little is known about the effects 
of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) on 
utilization of health care services in children. The present 
study compares medical service utilization by children 
with OSAS with that of healthy children. 

Methods. A cross-sectional study of 287 consecutively 
recruited children (1–18 years) with OSAS and no concomitant 
diseases and a control group matched by age, 
gender, and geographic location was conducted at the 
Clalit Health Care Services clinic in the southern region 
of Israel. Children in the study group underwent nocturnal 
polysomnography (PSG) studies. The control group 
(N . 
1149) was randomly selected from the Clalit Health 
Care Services database. PSG was performed for the 
OSAS patients. Indices of health care utilization 1 year 
before the PSG study were analyzed. 

Results. A 226% increase in health care utilization 
was noted among children with OSAS. Children up to 5 
years of age consumed more health care resources than 
children over 5 years. Children with OSAS consumed 
more health care services than the control group at all 
ages. The leading components of this high cost are utilization 
of more hospital days, drugs, and visits to the 
emergency department. The severity of the OSAS correlates 
directly to total annual costs and independently to 
age (. 
0.19). 

Conclusions. Children with OSAS are heavy consumers 
of health care services 1 year before any specific 
evaluation and treatment for apnea. Early diagnosis and 
intervention may be cost-effective. Pediatrics 2002;110:

neurocognitive problems, growth retardation, and 
poor school achievement.1– 6 The prevalence of OSAS 
in children is estimated to be 1% to 2%.1,7 The most 
common cause of OSAS in children is adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy; adenotonsillectomy (T&A) is the treatment 
of choice.8 

Recent evidence9 –11 demonstrated that adults with 
OSAS are massive consumers of health care services, 
including higher admission rates and longer lengths 
of stay in hospitals,12 with a 2-to 3.5-fold increase 
compared with healthy subjects years before their 
apnea is diagnosed in sleep laboratories. This elevation 
of health care consumption was related to cardiovascular 
morbidity, obesity, and, most likely, risk 
factors that predispose to OSAS, such as alcohol use, 
caffeine, and tobacco use.9,12 Adequate treatment by 
continuous positive airway pressure, which is the 
treatment of choice, reduces health care utilization11–
13 and improves quality-adjusted life years.14 

A recent state-of-the-art publication on sleep disorder 
breathing in children1 did not emphasize the 
effect of OSAS on the health care system. We hypothesized 
that because of the associated morbidity, 
health care utilization by these children would be 
higher. In the present study, we compared the utilization 
of medical resources of children with OSAS to 
a matched healthy control group. 

METHODS 

Subjects 

All children are members of Clalit Health Care Services (CHS), 
the largest health maintenance organization in Israel. All children 
who participated in the study were from the Negev, the southern 
region of Israel. This region includes approximately 450 000 CHS 
enrollees, 20% of whom are of Bedouin origin. All families of 
included children had been permanent residents of the region for 
at least 3 years before study initiation. 

We compared health care utilization between “typical” OSAS 
and control patients. We excluded children who exhibited extreme 
consumption of health care services, ie, 10 times the mean values 
of their group. This excluded 3 children from the OSAS group and 
none from the control group. 

The study group included all children who were ages 1 to 18 
years and referred to the Sleep-Wake Disorder Unit in the Soroka 
University Medical Center in Beer-Sheva for evaluation of OSAS. 
Children were recruited consecutively during the period of August 
1998 through August 2000. We excluded children younger 
than 1 year and those with additional chronic morbidity. 

The control group was matched to the OSAS group by age, 
gender, and area of residence (to adjust for socioeconomic factors). 
Four control subjects with no documentation for concomitant 
chronic disease were randomly selected for each OSAS patient 
(using Microsoft Access; Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA) from the 
regional CHS database (containing 126 357 enrollees). We con

firmed that the control group was healthy by verifying that they 
did not receive any long-term medication. 

Polysomnographic Evaluation 

The Sleep-Wake Disorder Unit in the Soroka University Medical 
Center is the only such center for children in the Negev. All 
children underwent nocturnal polysomnographic (PSG) monitoring 
(SensorMedics Inc, Yorba Linda, CA).15 

Subjects reported to the sleep laboratory at 8:30 pm and were 
discharged at 7:30 am the next morning. They were encouraged to 
maintain their usual daily routine and take medications as usual. 

Overnight PSG monitoring was performed as follows. Two 
silver-silverchloride electroencephalogram (EEG) electrodes filled 
with electrolyte were applied to the C3 and C4 locations, and 
reference electrodes were attached behind the ears in the left (A1) 
and right (A2) mastoid areas. Two electromyographic electrodes 
were applied over the submental muscles. Two electro-oculographic 
electrodes were applied 1 cm above the outer canthus of 
1 eye and 1 cm below the outer canthus of the other eye. The 
montage arrangement for PSG reading consisted of C3A2 and 
O2A1, 2 electro-oculographic, and electrocardiogram (modified V2 
lead). Nasal airflow was monitored by a pressure transducer 
(RespSponse; Synectics Sleep Inc, Stockholm, Sweden); thoracic 
and abdominal movements were monitored by strain gauge electrodes; 
and hemoglobin oxygen saturation was monitored by 
pulse oximetry (Ohmeda 4700, Madison, WI). Sleep/wake sleep 
stages,16 arousals, and awakenings were scored as recommended 
with the appropriate modifications for children, 3,17,18 and obstructive 
apneic and hypopneic events7 were recorded. 

Health Care Utilization 

The CHS billing system records 95% of all medical expenditures 
of the health maintenance organization. All costs were collected 
for each child in the 12-month period before the PSG 
evaluation. The costs of the PSG, as well as direct or indirect costs 
resulting from the PSG study, were not included in the study. 

Cost indicators include 1) number of hospitalization days, 
number of pediatric “day hospital” visits (24-hour admission), 
and number of emergency department (ED) visits; 2) number of 
(new and repeated) visits to the primary care physician and specialist; 
3) drugs prescribed (type and cost for each drug; all prescribed 
drugs are categorized according to World Health Organization 
recommendation19); and 4) diagnostic tests. We defined 
“total annual cost” as the sum of the costs for all indicators. Costs 
are expressed as the mean per patient per year in US dollars 
according to the price list published by the Israeli Ministry of 
Health. The exchange rate was NIS4.1 per 1 US dollar. Values were 
adjusted for inflation. 

Data Analysis 

Cost data were analyzed according to previously reported recommendations20 
using SPSS software (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL). 
Population t test was used to determine differences in respiratory 
and sleep parameters between children 5 years and 5 years. 2 
test was used to confirm “population match” between the control 
and OSAS population in relation to gender and age. Two-way 
analysis of variance was used to determine the significance of total 
annual costs in children 5 and 5 years in the OSAS and control 
populations. Stepwise multiple linear regression tests were performed 
to analyze the effects of respiratory disturbances index 

(RDI), age, and arousal index on total annual costs. Mann-Whitney 
test was used to determine statistical significance of cost elements. 
Data were presented as mean . 
standard deviation for all sleep 
parameters (Table 1) and as mean . 
standard error of the mean 
(SEM) for costs; statistical significance was accepted when P . 
.05. 
The Ethics Committee of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev 
approved this study. 

RESULTS 

Population Characteristics 

A total of 287 children with a mean age of 5.7 . 
3.7 
years (male/female: 106/186) were referred for PSG 
evaluation. We excluded 50 children who had 
known comorbidity. The control population included 
1149 children matched (2 test) for age and 
gender (mean age: 5.7 . 
3.5 years; male/female: 
426/726). 

The OSAS population (Table 1) had an average 
RDI of 7.9 . 
9.5 events/h, compatible with OSAS of 
moderate severity.21 RDI was higher (P . 
.05) in 
children up to age 5. As expected, RDI during rapid 
eye movement sleep was higher. As a group, children 
with OSAS did not present evidence of significant 
nocturnal hypoxemia but demonstrated a significantly 
higher number of arousals. RDI severity 
was comparable between boys and girls. 

Health Care Utilization 

Health care utilization (Fig 1) among the OSAS 
population was 226% (P . 
.001) higher than in the 
control population. Table 2 summarizes the mean 
cost elements per patient per year before the PSG 
study. Patients with OSAS had an average of 0.1 new 
admissions per year compared with 0.06 new admissions 
(P . 
.05) in the control group. Mean number of 
hospitalization days was also higher in the OSAS 
population compared with control (0.23 vs 0.16 days, 
respectively; P . 
.05). Number of pediatric day hospital 
visits in the OSAS group was considerably 
higher as compared with the control group (0.06 vs 

0.03 days; P . 
.05). However, no differences in cost 
per day were found in pediatric day hospital visits 
between the 2 groups. 
Children with OSAS had considerably more visits 
to the ED compared with the control group (0.54 vs 

0.24 days, respectively; P . 
.05). The OSAS group 
needed more consultations (2 visits) than the control 
group (67% vs 19%; P . 
.05). 
Common consultations in the OSAS group included 
ears, nose, and throat surgeons for 210 children 
(69.7%), pediatric pulmonologists for 43 chil-

(15%). Other consultations included neurologists, 
cardiologists, dermatologists, and orthopedic surgeons 
(27 children [10%] for each specialty). The 
control population had significantly lower visit rates 
to specialists: 138 children (12%) to ears, nose, and 
throat surgeons, and 103 children (9%) to ophthalmologists; 
all other specialists had 1% to 5% referrals 
per specialty. 

The main diagnostic tests for OSAS patients included 
facial sinus radiographs in 147 children 
(51%), chest radiographs in 44 children (15%), hearing 
tests in 32 children (11%), tympanometry in 15 
children (5%), and EEG in 12 children (4%). The 
control group had chest radiographs in 59 children 
(5%), radiograph of the facial sinuses in 32 children 
(3%), audiometry in 25 children (2%), tympanometry 
in 12 children (1%), and EEG in 7 children (0.6%). 
The cost of imaging and diagnostic tests for children 
with OSAS was significantly higher as compared 
with the controls (P .001).

for 80% of the cost for prescribed drugs: respiratory

system drugs (4.6-fold greater in the OSAS group 
[P .05]); general anti-infective drugs for systemic 
use (2.4-fold greater in the OSAS group [P .05]); 
dermatologicals (2.1-fold greater in the OSAS group 
[P .05]), and various other drugs (14.6-fold greater 
in the OSAS group [P .05]). The cost of the prescribed 
drugs was 301% (P .0001) higher in the 
OSAS group compared with the control group (Table 
2). 

An analysis of distribution of RDI and total annual 
cost according to the number of subjects, by year of 
life, is presented in Table 3. A total of 236 of the 287 
children (82%) with OSAS included in the present 
study were in the 1-to 8-year-old age range. Between 
2 and 7 years of age, the distribution of the number 
of children who underwent PSG study was roughly 
the same. OSAS severity according to RDI was the 
same for this age range. There was a significant 
linear correlation between the age of the children and 
total annual costs for both the OSAS and control 
groups (. 
0.23, P .002). However, the OSAS 
group had significantly higher costs (P .001) compared 
with the control group, for all ages in the 1-to 
8-year-old range (Table 3). 

Costs, Age, Ethnicity, and RDI 

The leading elements of cost that explain the differences 
between children 5 years compared with 
children 5 years are summarized in Table 4. In both 
groups, we found that children 5 years consume 
more health care resources (P .001, 2-way analysis 
of variance) compared with children 5 years (Fig 2). 
Children 5 years had more hospitalization days, 
had more visits to the ED, and received more prescriptions 
for more drugs. 

Total annual costs for the entire OSAS population 
was found to correlate with age but not with ethnic 
group or arousal index. Additional analysis (Table 5) 
by a split multiple stepwise multiple linear regression 
(children up to and above the age of 5 years) 
revealed that OSAS severity, as calculated by RDI 
but not arousal index, correlated independently to 
the total annual costs only for children 5 years. For 
children 5 years, no correlation was found between 
total annual cost and RDI or arousal index. 

DISCUSSION 

In the present study, we demonstrated that children 
with OSAS are heavy consumers of health care 
resources. The main elements that affect this high 
consumption of health services are hospitalization 
rates, visits to the ED, and specialists and drugs 
issued. Children who are 5 years and have OSAS 
are higher consumers of health care services than are 
children who are 5 years and the control group. In 
children 5 years, RDI correlated to the total annual 
costs. 

Several lines of evidence support our premise that 
the information presented in this study reflects the 
“true” consumption of health care resources of children 
with OSAS. First, all PSG and the relevant medical 
information regarding OSAS patients are stored 
in the only Sleep-Wake Disorder Center in the study 
region. Second, CHS uses 1 billing system located in

the regional Department of Health Economics. Third, 
equal access to medical services is provided to all 
children according to the national health care law 
implemented in January 1995. Finally, physicians are 
paid a capitation fee once every 3 months per patient 
and therefore do not have any economic incentive to 
increase consumption of services. 

Our data may be difficult to compare with those 
from other health care systems that have more than 1 
payer. We believe that our data can be compared 
with recently published9–11 reports from Manitoba, 
Canada, where they demonstrated higher health care 
service utilization in adults with OSAS. 

The present study demonstrates results for “typical” 
children with OSAS because we excluded 3 children 
who showed a 10-fold increase in health care 
utilization. The control population was matched by 
age, gender, and settlement location (to control for 
socioeconomic factors); thus, we compared patients 
matched to general population controls. The control 
group was selected randomly from a database containing 
information about chronic diseases and/or 
prescribing medications for chronic conditions. We 
do not have medical information on the control 
group. It is possible that 1% to 2% of the control 
population might have undiagnosed OSAS. With 
this in mind, our control population was 4 times 
larger than the group with OSAS. 

Health care utilization in adults with OSAS is related 
to risk factors that predispose to OSAS, such as 
obesity, alcohol use, caffeine and tobacco consumption, 
and comorbidity, eg, cardiovascular complications 
and hypertension.9,12 In the current study, the 
elevation of health care consumption is most likely 
related to the associated morbidity in children with 
OSAS. We assume that recurrent respiratory tract 
infections were the main problem, but additional 
investigation of the patient complaints that led to ED 
visits is required. Our database for the present study 
did not include this type of information. 

This study was designed to compare the cost of

medical services for children with OSAS with 
matched controls. Several findings within the patient 
group warrant elaboration. We found that children 

5 years have more severe OSAS (higher RDI) than 
children 5 years. This can be explained by the fact 
that occurrence of adenotonsillar hypertrophy peaks 
between ages 3 and 6.1,22 In addition, in children 5 
years, health care utilization was maximal. The main 
factors in elevated total annual costs in children who 
are 5 years and have OSAS are inpatient admissions 
and visits to the ED. These 2 cost indicators 
may reflect severe morbidity, are mainly induced by 
physicians, and can serve as “objective” indicators to 
identify patients with high morbidity. Inpatient admissions, 
visits to the ED, and prescription drugs 
represent 50% of total annual costs of OSAS patients. 
It is interesting that the amount of sleep fragmentation 
(high number of arousals) does not affect costs. 
Additional research is planned to identify information 
in the medical diagnoses that influence admissions, 
visits to the ED, and drug consumption by 
children with OSAS.

who had OSAS and underwent T&A revealed a

the effect of intervention on costs and quality of life. 
OSAS is a chronic condition in children and adults. 
Chronic disorders consume most of the health care 
resources; therefore, decision makers should prioritize 
early OSAS diagnosis and treatment.14,24 A better 
understanding of OSAS in children may necessitate 
a change in our approach to treatment, for 
example, defining better timing for PSG evaluation 
and T&A. This in turn may provide better medical 
and cost outcomes. 

CONCLUSION 

We found that children with OSAS are heavy consumers 
of health care services 1 year before PSG 
evaluation. The consumption of health care services 
was greater in children 5 years and in direct correlation 
to the severity of OSAS. Additional research is 
needed to determine the proper timing for diagnosis 
and intervention relative to quality of life and cost-
effectiveness.
