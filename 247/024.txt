Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in children is a common 
disorder and may affect as many as 2% of children (1, 2). 
Frequently, OSAS is associated with adenoid and/or tonsillar 
hypertrophy. However, other anatomic and physiologic factors 
affecting upper airway size, shape, and function may play a role 
in the causation of OSAS in children (3). 

Studies suggest that the upper airway in children with OSAS 
is more collapsible compared with control subjects during wakefulness 
and sleep, and under general anesthesia (4–6). Several 
mechanisms may lead to more airway collapse in these subjects, 
including the following: decreased motor tone, increased airway 
compliance, and excessive inspiratory driving pressures caused 
by proximal airway narrowing. This increased propensity of the

airway to collapse should be reflected by increased motion of 
airway boundary during respiration as negative upper airway 
intraluminal pressure is increased. Hence, the quantification of 
such changes during respiration is important in understanding 
the pathogenesis of OSAS in children. 

Various techniques have been used in recent years to detect 
dynamic changes in the upper airway including the following: 
fluoroscopy, cine computed tomography, and fast magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) (7–12). However, newer methodologies 
capable of gating image acquisition to the respiratory cycle are 
now becoming available and may further enhance our knowledge 
about the temporal sequence leading to OSAS. 

To this end, we used respiratory-gated MRI to quantify changes 
in shape and airway cross-section area during tidal breathing in 
children with OSAS as compared with control subjects. We hypothesized 
that changes in upper airway cross-sectional area during 
tidal breathing will be larger in children with OSAS and 
that maximal narrowing will occur during inspiration when more 
negative intraluminal pressures are present. 

METHODS 


The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the 
Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Informed consent was obtained 
from each subject’s parent, and assent was obtained from children older 
than 6 years. 

Subjects 


Children with OSAS were recruited from the pool of patients evaluated 
for sleep-disordered breathing and adenotonsillar hypertrophy at the 
Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. After OSAS was confirmed by 
polysomnography, these subjects underwent an upper airway MRI 
under sedation. 

Control children with normal growth and development and intact 
tonsils and adenoids were matched to subjects with OSAS. Adenoid 
and/or tonsillar hypertrophy per 
se 
did not exclude them from the study 
if they did not have symptoms suggestive of OSAS (13). Control subjects 
were selected from patients who underwent head MRI for other medical 
indications. Parents gave consent for an upper airway MRI that followed 
head MRI, with no additional sedation. 

Exclusion criteria for control subjects included the following: (1 
) 
likelihood of OSAS assessed by standard questionnaire (13); (2 
) evidence 
of a brain tumor or a seizure disorder requiring therapy; (3) genetic 
disorders associated with any craniofacial anomaly; or (4 
) chronic respiratory 
disease, such as asthma. 

Overnight 
Polysomnography 


For subjects with OSAS, polysomnography was performed 0 to 4 weeks 
before MRI. Subjects were studied in the Sleep Disorders Center at 
the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. The scoring of respiratory 
variables was performed based on standards set by the American Thoracic 
Society and previously published data in children (14, 15). Flow was 
measured using an oral/nasal thermistor and a nasal end-tidal Pco2 catheter. 
We used the definition of obstructive apnea as the absence of oral/ 
nasal thermistor signal for at least two respiratory cycles associated 
with out-of-phase movement of the rib cage and abdomen. Hypopnea

was defined as a decrease of 50% or more in oral/nasal thermistor 
signal and a concurrent fall in 4% or more of basal oxygen saturation. 
Sleep stages were determined by the criteria of Rechtschaffen and 
Kales (16). Control subjects did not undergo polysomnography; sleep-
disordered breathing in these subjects was excluded by a validated 
questionnaire (13). 

Sleep 
Questionnaire 


Symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing were assessed according to a 
questionnaire developed by Brouillette and coworkers (13). Subjects 
with scores below –1 are not expected to have OSAS; a score between 
–1 and 3.5 is considered intermediate, and a score greater than 3.5 is 
considered highly suggestive of OSAS. 

MRI 


MRI studies were performed in the Department of Radiology at the 
Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. All studies were performed under 
sedation. Sedation was administered as intravenous pentobarbital of 
2-mg/kg increments until patients were sedated well enough to render 
their eyes closed and not move or arouse unless by a verbal or physical 
stimuli. A maximum of three doses or 200 mg was administered. All 
subjects were monitored continuously by pulse oximetry and were observed 
by an intensive care unit physician until recovery (. 
1 hour). 

Images were acquired using a standard, circular, polarized head coil. 
The patient’s head was positioned supine in the soft tissue Frankfort 
plane (tragus of the ear to orbital fissure) perpendicular to the table. 
Axial images were obtained on a 1.5-T Siemens Sonata system (Malvern, 
PA), using a two-dimensional trueFISP sequence with the following 
parameters: repetition time/echo time (TR/TE)/4.6/2.3/50; field of 
view (FOV) 20 0 1 50; matrix (MA) 25 6 1 92; half-Fourier 
acquisition, acquisition time 300 milliseconds/slice. 

Respiratory gating was performed using the Siemens Sonata gating 
system. A single respiratory bellows was placed around the lower chest/ 
upper abdomen to obtain an expansion and contraction synchronous 
with tidal breath inspiratory and expiratory volumes. The bellows-based 
Vt 
waveform signal triggered the scanner at preset volume percentage 
increments. Data for a 40-mm-thick axial slab from the level of the 
epiglottis to the upper nasopharynx (Figure 1) were obtained by acquiring 
10 4-mm-thick slices (0 gap) during 10 successive breaths, each slice 
gated to the same increment in Vt. Ten slabs were acquired at the 
following increments: 10, 30, 50, 70, and 90% of inspiration, and 90, 
70, 50, 30, and 10% of expiration. 

Upper airway cross-sectional areas from four consecutive cross-
sectional levels 4 mm apart from above the tip of the epiglottis (Figure 
1) during 10 phases of tidal breathing were measured using Volumetric 
Image Display and Analysis (Department of Radiology, University 
of Iowa, Ames, IA) (VIDA) (17, 18). The following analyses were 
performed: 

1. Cross-sectional area during each phase of inspiration/expiration. 
2. Minimal cross-sectional area during inspiration. 
3. Maximal cross-sectional area during expiration.

5. Upper airway shape change during inspiration/expiration: to 
quantify and compare anteroposterior (A-P) and lateral dimension 
changes in the airway cross-sections, we measured the maximum 
width along these axes for each image slice. Results for 
all subjects were averaged for each gated volume phase and 
oropharyngeal level. The measured A-P and lateral dimensions 
were used to create a simple geometric model of the airway cross-
sections, based on an ellipse. 
Validation 
of 
Gating 
System 


We assessed the accuracy of the Siemens bellows triggering system in 
a normal, awake, adult volunteer by measuring the timing of the gating 
signal of the Siemens Sonata bellows volume trigger signal concurrently 
with the gating signal produced by a mask/pneumotach-based system 
at each volume level (10, 30, 50, 70, and 90% of inspiration, and 90, 70, 
50, 30, and 10% of expiration). This measurement was repeated 10 times 
at each phase of tidal breathing. We later determined the percentage 
differences between each system’s triggering times. 

Sample 
Size 
and 
Data 
Analysis 


A sample size of 10 subjects in each group was required to obtain 88% 
power to detect an effect size of 1.5 SD using a two-group t 
test with a 0.05 
two-sided significance level. This effect size assumption was calculated on 
the basis of a previous study of ours assessing mean airway cross-sectional 
area in subjects with OSAS and control subjects (18). 

Mean and SD were used to summarize continuous variables. For 
comparisons between the groups for MRI data, demographics, and 
questionnaire data, we used a two-tailed unpaired t 
test, Wilcoxon rank 
test, or 2 test, as appropriate. A p value of 0.05 or less was considered 
to indicate statistical significance. 

RESULTS 


We studied 10 sequential children with adenotonsillar hypertrophy 
and OSAS; their mean age was 4.3 . 
2.3 years (range, 
2.0–7.2 years). The recruitment rate for subjects with OSAS was 
30%. In addition, 10 control subjects were studied; their mean 
age was 5.0 2.0 years (range, 2.6–8.0 years). Control subjects 
were not significantly different from subjects with OSAS with 
respect to age, sex, ethnicity, height, or weight (Table 1). All 
subjects had normal development and cognitive function, intact 
tonsils and adenoids, and no respiratory disorders or craniofacial 
anomalies. The primary indications for head MRI in control 
subjects were as follows: migraine/headache (six subjects), single 
seizure/febrile convulsion (three subjects), and external ear mass 
(one subject). Thus, none of these clinical indications would be 
expected to affect upper airway anatomy.

Polysomnography 


For subjects with OSAS the mean total sleep time during polysomnography 
was 8.1 . 
0.7 hours (Table 2). The mean respiratory 
variables values during this period were as follows: apnea index, 

1.5 . 
1.9; apnea–hypopnea index, 5.7 . 
4.7; SpO2 nadir, 85 . 
5%; peak end-tidal CO2,50 . 
6 mm Hg; and arousal/awakening 
index, 16.8 . 
3.6. Thus, these data suggest mild–moderate OSAS 
in this group. 
Sleep 
Questionnaire 


All control subjects had an apnea score of less than –1, indicating 
the unlikelihood of OSA (10), and as a group, had a mean apnea 
score of –3.83 . 
0.0. This score was significantly lower than the 
apnea score noted in the OSAS group of 2.06 . 
1.33 (p . 
0.0001). 

MRI 


Mean changes in cross-sectional areas at four ascending oropharyngeal 
levels during 10 phases of tidal breathing (five inspiratory 
phases and five expiratory phases) of subjects with OSAS and 
control subjects are presented in Figure 2. Areas at 0 and 100% 
of Vt 
are estimated as the midpoint between measured values 
(dashed lines). A representative comparison of changes in cross-
sectional area at midtonsillar level (level 2) during tidal breathing 
of a subject with OSAS and a control subject is presented in 
Figure 3. Movies showing gated dynamic images during tidal 
breathing in a subject with OSAS and control subject are available 
in the online supplement (Figure E1). 

Changes 
in 
cross-sectional 
area 
during 
inspiration/expiration. 
There is a significantly smaller upper airway cross-sectional area 
during tidal breathing at most volume increments in subjects 
with OSAS compared with control subjects, particularly during 
inspiration (Figure 2). There is also a much larger dynamic change 
in cross-sectional area in subjects with OSAS throughout the respiratory 
cycle, compared with the relatively constant cross-sectional 
area throughout tidal breathing in the control subjects. We now 
provide quantitative data on these dynamic changes. 

Minimal 
cross-sectional 
area 
measurements 
during 
inspiration. 
Children with OSAS exhibited significantly smaller cross-sectional 
area at oropharyngeal levels 1, 2, 3, and 4 compared with control 
subjects (p . 
0.0001, for all). A trend for a narrower airway at 
the higher oropharyngeal levels was noted (Figure 4). 

Maximal 
cross-sectional 
area 
measurements 
during 
expiration. 
Maximal cross-sectional area measurements at each oropharyngeal 
level were similar in subjects with OSAS and control subjects 
during expiration (p .

They also exhibit a large change from inspiration to expiration, 
primarily occurring on the lateral axis. In contrast, the control 
airway cross-sections are narrower along the A-P axis as compared 
with the lateral, are similarly sized at all levels, and exhibit 
only slight narrowing during inspiration. (19).

DISCUSSION 


This study describes changes in upper airway area and shape 
during tidal breathing in mildly sedated children with OSAS. 
We found that the upper airway in these children is significantly 
narrower compared with control subjects, particularly during 
inspiration, whereas dilatation occurs during expiration. In contrast, 
the upper airway area changed little during tidal respiration 
in normal children. As compared with control subjects, the magnitude 
of area change in OSAS was more prominent in the upper 
oropharyngeal levels, ranging from 317 to 922% in children with

shape, we found, in general, control subjects had airway cross-
sections wider along the lateral axis, whereas subjects with OSAS 
exhibited airway shape wider along the A-P axis. 

Several methodologic issues deserve an initial comment. First, 
MRI can provide both accurate and reliable measurements of 
the upper airway (18, 20). However, a disadvantage of MRI is 
its sensitivity to motion artifact. Although we used a fast image 
sequence of 300 milliseconds/image, acquisition of data required 
approximately 15 minutes to collect all breath phases for all 
slices. To minimize movement, light sedation is given routinely 
for MRI studies to all children younger than 8 years in our 
institution. Sedation might have differentially affected upper

airway dilator muscle responses in subjects with OSAS compared 
with control subjects because in children with OSAS there is 
increased activity of the upper airway dilator muscles during 
wakefulness (21). Conceivably, this had an impact on the magnitude 
of differences we found between groups. 

Second, respiratory gating for obtaining MRI images of the 
upper airway has not been used previously. We used the Siemens 
commercial system, which is based on a single respiratory bellows 
to follow the changes in volume and trigger the imaging at 
desired inspiratory or expiratory volumes. An optimal system 
would be one gated by an integrated flow measurement; however, 
such a system is not yet available for clinical use. The 
purpose of our validation study was to assess the accuracy of

the commercial bellows’ abdominal signal to track lung volume 
changes as measured by an integrated pneumotach flow signal 
at the mouth. We demonstrated that, in a normal, awake, adult 
volunteer, when no obstruction is apparent, the bellows track 
volume change within . 
5% of the optimal measurement. We 
are therefore confident that our images were accurately gated 
in control subjects. 

Regarding the subjects with OSAS, these subjects had mild 
to moderate OSAS during polysomnography. However, during 
data acquisition, none had evidence of obstruction based on 
direct inspection and respiratory and pulse oximetry monitoring, 
although snoring in some subjects was noted. Our MRI data 
obtained from these patients do not demonstrate complete airway 
occlusion at any point during data acquisition. 

Bellows placement was made on the abdomen or abdominal– 
chest border where tidal excursion was visibly greatest. The 
Siemens gating algorithm is designed to avoid triggering an image 
if the abdominal waveform does not conform to a standard 
template created by averaging previous regular breaths. In this 
way, transient and malformed abdominal waveform shapes were 
definitely excluded. 

It is possible, however, that partial obstructive events inducing 
some degree of paradoxic motion in the chest during inspiration 
did occur and could have shifted the inspiratory data points 
of our curves shown in Figure 2, by delaying thoracic filling 
with respect to abdominal expansion. In addition, an opposite 
displacement of the curve points could occur during expiration, 
when emptying would be delayed with respect to abdominal 
relaxation. However, for each subject, at each phase of respiration, 
each image slice was collected by gating a single and different 
breath, and the calculated airway area values represent averages 
from all subjects. Therefore, errors caused by sporadic asynchrony 
would tend to be reduced. In more severe cases of OSAS where 
obstructions occur, chest and abdominal asynchrony could be 
expected and a gating system based on measurements of chest 
wall or abdominal motion alone would be inappropriate. 

Changes in the upper airway size during tidal breathing using 
gated cine computed tomography have been described by 
Schwab and colleagues (10) in normal, awake adults. They noted 
mean tidal change in upper airway cross-sectional area to be 
17% and that during expiration the upper airway expanded to 
maximal cross-sectional area. In another study, the same authors 
compared dynamic changes in airway size during wakefulness 
in adults with OSAS and control subjects. They noted a smaller 
airway in subjects with OSAS, particularly in the low retropalatal 
and retroglossal levels, and that airway narrowing occurred 
mostly during inspiration, whereas dilatation of the airway occurred 
in expiration, leading to significant change in cross-sectional 
area in all oropharyngeal regions in subjects with OSAS. Furthermore, 
upper airway shape analysis in the regions of maximal 
dynamic changes showed a lengthened A-P configuration in subjects 
with OSAS, unlike the normal airway, which had a lengthened 
lateral configuration (9). The previously described findings 
in adults with OSAS are very similar to the present study in 
children. Our findings suggest that, despite a different pathophysiology 
for OSAS in adults and children, namely adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy (3), similar mechanical forces influence upper 
airway dynamics and shape in both age groups. It should also 
be emphasized that, by using MRI, our subjects were not exposed 
to ionizing radiation and therefore our methodology may be 
considered as an advantage over computed tomography when 
studying airway dynamics. 

Children presenting with adenotonsillar hypertrophy and 
OSAS do not usually undergo dynamic imaging of the upper 
airway. However, when OSAS is associated with more complex 
medical conditions, such as craniofacial anomalies or after upper 

airway surgery, fluoroscopy is commonly used to detect the level 
of airway obstruction (22, 23). The limitations of fluoroscopy 
are both radiation exposure and that one obtains only a plane 
lateral image. More recently, Donnelly and coworkers (24, 25) 
applied ungated cine MRI to children with OSAS with complex 
medical conditions. They demonstrated significant fluctuations 
in airway size during respiration in subjects with OSAS along 
the entire upper airway compared with control subjects, a finding 
that is compatible with our results. 

In the present study, we performed respiratory-gated MRI 
of the upper airway during tidal breathing using respiratory 
gating to quantify the temporal changes during respiration in 
children with adenotonsillar hypertrophy who otherwise had no 
additional risk factors, such as craniofacial anomalies or neurologic 
disorders. Several observations can be made from our data. 
The first is further confirmation of previous studies demonstrating 
a smaller airway size in children with OSAS (18, 26, 27). A 
second finding is the significant fluctuation in airway area in 
subjects with OSAS during inspiration and expiration. Because 
of their increased upper airway resistance caused by adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy, inspiratory pressure load on the airway was 
probably more negative than in control subjects on inspiration, 
thus reducing area, and more positive than control subjects on 
expiration, thus increasing area. It is possible that a more compliant 
airway is involved in this effect, but this is impossible to 
determine without having measured airway pressures. A third 
finding is the absence of progressive narrowing of the upper 
airway during inspiration in both control and OSAS subjects. It 
was expected that at peak inspiratory flow rate (midinspiration), 
the airway would progressively narrow with the increasing negative 
intraluminal pressure. The latter finding indirectly supports 
evidence for inspiratory activation of upper dilator muscles described 
in normal adults (28–31), and also noted in children with 
OSAS (32, 33). This mechanism is assumed to protect the airway 
from collapse during the negative pressures generated in the 
upper airway during inspiration (34). Previous studies in adults 
have demonstrated marked attenuation of this reflex, even in 
the lighter stages of sleep (35). Our conjecture is that this mechanism 
still seems to be operative in children, even during light 
sedation given that our subjects with OSAS did not fully obstruct, 
even under increased negative loads. 

Shape analysis demonstrated different configuration of the 
airway of children with OSAS in both inspiration and expiration 
as compared with control subjects. Subjects with OSAS exhibited 
airway shape narrowed across the A-P axis. This could be caused 
by anatomic features influencing the width of the lateral pharyngeal 
wall and/or by neuromotor factors affecting upper airway 
dilator muscle activity along this axis (i.e., genioglossus activation). 
These differences together with the magnitude of area 
changes during tidal breathing may contribute to a more collapsible 
airway in children with OSAS during sleep as suggested by 
functional studies (4–6). 

In summary, we describe changes in upper airway area and 
shape during tidal breathing in children with OSAS and contrast 
these to changes in control subjects. We noted significantly more 
fluctuation in airway size, with narrowing during inspiration that 
was more prominent in higher oropharyngeal levels.
