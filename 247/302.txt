Abstract 

Background and purpose: To determine the association between structural cardiac changes and postoperative respiratory complications after 

adenotonsillectomy for obstructive breathing during sleep. 
Patients and methods: Forty-eight children, ages 2–18 years, undergoing adenotonsillectomy for obstructive breathing during sleep were 
recruited for this case control study. The case group consisted of 24 children with postoperative respiratory complications after 
adenotonsillectomy who also had an echocardiogram. An equal number of children without postoperative respiratory complications after 
adenotonsillectomy were recruited as controls. Left ventricular mass (LVM) was calculated from 2D guided M mode echocardiographic 
measurements of the left ventricle. Left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was calculated as left ventricular mass/height2.7. Left ventricular 
hypertrophy (LVH) was defined as LVMI index greater than the 95th percentile for age. The two groups were compared for demographic 
variables and cardiac structure. 


Results: The two groups did not significantly differ by age, height, gender or racial distribution. LVH and right ventricular (RV) dimension 
greater than the 95th percentile for age remained significantly associated with the occurrence of postoperative respiratory complications after 
controlling for body mass index (BMI) Z score, age, gender, race, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. 


Conclusions: The increased prevalence of structural cardiac changes in the group with complications (P!0.01) suggests an underlying 
cardiac origin for postoperative respiratory complications in this group of children.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is reported to occur in 
about 2–3% of children, with approximately two million 
children in the US affected by this syndrome [1]. 
Untreated OSA is associated with neurocognitive, metabolic 
and cardiovascular morbidity [2]. Adenotonsillectomy, 
the first line of treatment for childhood OSA, is 
associated with postoperative respiratory complications 
including pulmonary edema in 20–25% of children with

OSA [3–6]. Severity of OSA, as determined by 
polysomnogram, is reported to be the best predictor for 
occurrence of postoperative respiratory complications [5]. 
Recently, it was shown that OSA in normotensive 
children is associated with both RV dilatation and LVH, 
with the degree of LVH being related to the degree of 
severity of OSA [7]. The purpose of this study was to 
determine the association between structural cardiac 
changes and postoperative respiratory complications 
after adenotonsillectomy for obstructive breathing during 
sleep. Identification of structural cardiac changes as risk

factors for postoperative respiratory complications will 
allow us to improve the perioperative care for children 
with OSA. 

1. Methods 
Forty-eight children, ages 2–18 years, undergoing 
adenotonsillectomy for obstructive breathing during 
sleep were recruited for this case control study. The 
case group consisted of 24 children with postoperative 
respiratory complications after adenotonsillectomy who 
also had an echocardiogram. An equal number of children 
without postoperative respiratory complications after 
adenotonsillectomy were recruited as controls. This 
study was approved by the Institutional Review Board 
at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital and all families signed 
consent. The presence of obstructive breathing was 
determined by history of snoring and the presence of 
adenotonsillar hypertrophy on examination by an otolaryngologist. 
Children with preexisting cardiac or renal 
disease and those undergoing any concurrent surgical 
procedures that increased the duration of anesthesia were 
excluded. The case definition for respiratory complication 
was the occurrence of any of the following within 24 h 
after adenotonosillectomy: 

(a) Oxygen 
desaturation below 90% leading to oxygen 
supplementation for more than 8 h; 
(b) apnea 
or increased work of breathing leading to the 
following interventions: nasopharyngeal airway, continuous 
positive airway pressure, intubation and 
mechanical ventilation; 
(c) chest 
X-ray changes of atelectasis, pneumonia, or 
edema. 
Echocardiographic studies were performed, in the 
perioperative period, using the Hewlett Packard Sonos 
5500 or GE vivid five Ultrasound Imaging Systems. 
Echocardiographic measurements were made on three or 
more cardiac cycles according to the recommendations of 
the American Society of Echocardiography [8].The 
sonographer was blinded to the subject’s clinical status 
and therefore group allocation. LVM was calculated from 
two-dimensional directed M-mode measurements of the left 
ventricular inner dimension in end-diastole (LVID), the 
thickness of the interventricular septum in end-diastole 
(IVS), and the thickness of the left ventricular posterior 
wall (PWT). End-diastole was defined as the onset of 
the QRS complex. The equation described by Devereux 
et al. [9], LVMðgÞZ0:8½1:04ðLVIDCPWTCIVSÞ3K 
ðLVIDÞ3C0:6, was used for LVM calculation. An average 
of three measurements was used in the analysis. To 
minimize the impact of variation of heart size by body 
size, the LV mass was divided by the subjects’ height raised 
to the power of 2.7 as described by De Simone et al. [10] to 

provide LVMI. LVH was defined as LVMI greater than 
95th percentile for age. Based on published normative data, 
a value of 38.6 g/ht2.7 was considered the 95th percentile for 
LVMI [11]. The RV dimensions were determined from 
M-mode measurements of the right ventricule at end-
diastole. The resting blood pressure was obtained for all 
subjects. The Z score for body mass index for age (BMI Z) 
was calculated by the SAS program using the 2000 CDC 
growth charts [12]. 

Continuous variables and categorical outcome variables 
were analyzed using Students’ t-test and c 2, respectively. 
Logistic regression univariate analysis was used to identify 
potential risk factors associated with respiratory complications. 
Multivariate logistic regression analysis was 
performed to develop a model predictive of the occurrence 
of respiratory complications. In all analyses, a P-value of 

0.05 or less was considered significant. 
2. Results 
In the group with postoperative respiratory complications 
(NZ24), 12 children received oxygen supplementation 
alone, three received a nasopharyngeal airway, five 
received continuous positive airway pressure support, and 
four received intubation and mechanical ventilation. Among 
the 15 children who had a chest radiograph, it was reported 
as normal in 46.6%, pulmonary edema in 26.6%, and air 
space disease in 26.6%. The two groups did not significantly 
differ by age, height, gender or racial distribution. The group 
with postoperative complications had a significantly higher 
BMI and BMI Z score (Table 1). There was no significant 
difference between the two groups in their systolic or 
diastolic pressure indexed to the 95th percentile for age and 
gender (Table 1).

The two groups differed in the LVM, LVMI, proportion 
with LVH (LVMI greater than 95th percentile), RV

than 95th percentile (Table 2). Univariate logistic regression 
analysis revealed that only BMI Z score, RV dimension 
greater than the 95th percentile and LVH were significantly 
associated with the occurrence of postoperative respiratory 
complications (Table 3). LVH and RV dimension greater 
than the 95th percentile for age remained significantly 
associated with the occurrence of postoperative respiratory 
complications after controlling for BMI Z score, age, 
gender, race, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (Table 3). 

3. Discussion 
Obstructive breathing during sleep is now the major 
indication for adenotonsillectomy in children [13]. Postoperative 
respiratory complications, which range from 
oxygen desaturation to respiratory failure requiring 
mechanical ventilation, continue to represent a significant

This table shows the results of logistic regression analysis to look at the 
relationship between the presence of potential risk factors and occurrence 
of postoperative respiratory complications. Multivariate analysis was 
performed to study the effect of demographic variables on the association

morbidity following adenotonsillectomy. Neither the 
mechanism nor the prevalence of each type of respiratory 
complication is well defined. There are several reports of 
postoperative pulmonary edema in children undergoing 
adenotonsillectomy for obstructive breathing during sleep 
[14,15]. It is believed that edema in this group of patients 
is non-cardiogenic in origin. The balance between alveolar 
pressure and pulmonary vascular pressure prevents movement 
of fluid into the alveolar space. The alveolar 
pressure is partly dependent on the peak end expiratory 
pressure (PEEP). Sudden relief of upper airway obstruction 
after surgery leads to a loss of PEEP thereby resulting 
in movement of fluid from the vascular compartment into 
the lung alveoli. There is, however, a plausible mechanism 
for cardiogenic origin of postadenotonsillectomy 
pulmonary edema in children with obstructive breathing 
during sleep. LVH is associated with abnormal left 
ventricular diastolic function [16] resulting in higher left 
ventricular end diastolic pressure and thereby increased 
pulmonary vascular pressures. General anesthesia has a 
dose-dependent depressant effect on myocardial contractility 
[17], with a greater depression of hypertrophied 
myocardium [18]. We speculate that LVH leading to 
diastolic dysfunction, with a further decrease in systolic 
function under anesthesia, is a possible mechanism for 
post-adenotonsillectomy pulmonary edema in children 
with obstructive breathing during sleep. Pulmonary 
hypertension leading to imbalance between starling’s 
forces that keep fluid out of the lung alveoli could be 
another mechanism for pulmonary edema in this group of 
children. This explains why RV dilatation and LVH may 
increase the risk of respiratory complications in children 
after adenotonsillectomy for obstructive breathing during 
sleep. 

There are several plausible mechanisms for LVH in 
children with OSA. Children with OSA have increased 
systemic blood pressure variability and a decreased 
nocturnal dipping as compared to children with primary 
snoring [19]. It has been previously reported that nondipping 
of blood pressure is associated with a greater LVMI 
and relative thickness of the left ventricular wall [20].Itis 
possible that the increased LVMI observed in our study 
group is due to blood pressure dysregulation. Chronic 
episodic hypoxia could be another mechanism for LVH in 
children with OSA. Animal studies have demonstrated that 
exposure to chronic episodic hypoxia was associated with 
an increase in the LVM [21,22]. 

LVM was indexed by height2.7 in this study. We have 
published extensively on the method for indexing LVM by 
height and have found that indexing by height2.7 provides the 
best correlation with pathologic data [10,23,24]. 
This method of indexing provides an approximation to 
indexing by lean body mass and separates the influence of 
body size from the influence of adiposity which is probably a 
pathologic effect. In our study, the LVMI difference between 
the two groups persisted when LVM was indexed to body

surface area. The normative data from our lab were derived 
from a very large population sample which included 
children with obesity. It is true that LVM is increased in 
subjects with obesity but the aim of this study was to 
determine if increased LVM is pathologic. Also, we 
investigated the independent effects of obesity and LVH 
by controlling for BMI in multivariate regression modeling. 

The independent association of BMI with postoperative 
respiratory complications after adenotonsillectomy in 
children has been previously reported [25] and is 
supported by our data. Obesity could contribute to 
development of respiratory complications through hypo-
ventilation and promote atelectasis. In addition, obesity 
could contribute to the development of postoperative 
respiratory complications by its effect on OSA severity 

[26] and direct effects on left ventricular mass [27]. OSA 
has been shown to be associated with LVH in non-obese 
children [7]. While the independent contribution of 
obesity and OSA towards LVH is well recognized, the 
effect of the interaction between these factors on the 
degree of LVH is not clear. 
This study has some limitations. The echocardiographic 
studies included in this study were targeted studies. We do 
not have data for diastolic function on our subjects as this 
was not a part of this study. However, this is an area which 
should be investigated further in the future. Also, objective 
data on severity of obstructive breathing during sleep was 
not available. Hence, we cannot assess whether the two 
groups have an equal distribution of children with severe 
obstructive breathing. 

Notwithstanding these limitations, we conclude that the 
presence of structural cardiac changes by echocardiogram is 
associated with the occurrence of postoperative respiratory 
complications after adenotonsillectomy in children with 
obstructive breathing during sleep. This is the first report on 
cardiac risk factor for postadenotonsillectomy respiratory 
complications in children with obstructive breathing during 
sleep. Further studies should be carried out to understand the 
contribution of cardiac dysfunction to the development of 
postoperative respiratory complications in children with 
obstructive breathing during sleep. Prospective studies 
looking at the value of echocardiogram as a screening tool 
in this group of children should be undertaken. In the 
interim, clinicians should consider using echocardiography 
as a diagnostic tool for their patients undergoing adenotonsillectomy 
for OSA.
