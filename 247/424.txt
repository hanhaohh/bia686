Summary 
Introduction: 
Nasal 
obstruction 
is 
a 
common 
symptom 
in 
children 
and 
its 
etiology 
includes 
septal 
deviation, 
choanal 
atresia, 
allergic 
rhinitis 
and 
hypertrophy 
of 
the 
adenoids. 
Hypertrophy 
of 
the 
adenoids 
and 
hypertrophic 
rhinitis 
are 
the 
most 
frequent 
causes 
of 
nasal 
obstruction 
in 
the 
pediatric 
population, 
with 
adenoidectomy 
being 
the 
main 
surgery 
carried 
out 
during 
childhood. 
Objective: 
To 
analyze 
the 
rhino-
grams 
of 
children 
with 
nasal 
obstruction 
before 
and 
after 
surgery 
and 
to 
compare 
them 
with 
those 
obtained 
for 
children 
without 
respiratory 
complaints. 
Study 
design: 
A 
clinical 
prospective 
study. 
Methods: 
Thirty-five 
patients 
with 
adenoid 
or 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy 
were 
submitted 
to 
otolaryngologic 
examination 
and 
acoustic 
rhinometry 
before 
and 
30—60 
days 
after 
surgery. 
The 
control 
group 
consisted 
of 
18 
children 
without 
nasal 
complaints. 
Results: 
Significant 
differences 
in 
the 
rhinograms 
were 
observed 
before 
and 
after 
surgery, 
but 
not 
between 
patients 
and 
the 
control 
group. 
Conclusion: 
We 
conclude 
that 
acoustic 
rhinometry 
is 
well 
tolerated 
by 
children, 
and 
is 
a 
rapid 
and 
noninvasive 
method. 
The 
technique 
is 
valuable 
for 
interindividual 
comparisons, 
but 
not 
for 
the 
assessment 
of 
different 
groups.

Introduction 
Chronic 
nasal 
obstruction 
is 
a 
frequent 
clinical 
complaint 
during 
childhood 
[1]. 
The 
classical 
signs 
indicating 
nasal 
obstruction 
are 
mouth 
breathing, 
hyponasality, 
and 
snoring 
[2—4]. 


Nasal 
obstruction 
during 
childhood 
has 
different 
causes, 
which 
can 
be 
located 
in 
the 
nasal 
and/or 
nasopharyngeal 
cavities. 
These 
causes 
include

Palatine 
tonsillar 
hypertrophy 
and 
adenoid 
vegetation 
lead 
to 
increased 
nasopharyngeal 
airway 
resistance 
which 
results 
in 
a 
reduction 
in 
nasal 
airflow, 
followed 
by 
a 
vasomotor 
reaction 
and 
consequent 
hypertrophy 
of 
the 
inferior 
turbinates 
[8]. 


Nasal 
patency 
is 
difficult 
to 
assess. 
The 
symptoms 
of 
nasal 
obstruction 
shown 
by 
the 
patient 
may 
differ 
markedly 
from 
the 
clinical 
findings. 
It 
is 
therefore 
important 
to 
use 
an 
objective 
method 
for 
the 
assessment 
of 
nasal 
patency 
in 
order 
to 
supplement 
the 
history 
of 
the 
patient 
[9]. 


Despite 
the 
obvious 
deleterious 
impact 
of 
airway 
obstruction 
on 
children, 
convenient 
modalities 
for 
the 
assessment 
of 
airway 
patency 
are 
limited. 
The 
following 
methods 
have 
thus 
far 
been 
used 
to 
document 
adenoid 
size: 
(a) 
recording 
of 
obstructive 
symptoms, 
(b) 
transnasal 
fiberscopic 
examination, 


(c) 
transoral 
posterior 
rhinoscopy, 
(d) 
lateral 
X-ray 
evaluation 
of 
the 
rhinopharynx 
or 
magnetic 
resonance 
of 
the 
cavum, 
(e) 
rhinomanometry, 
and 
(f) 
acoustic 
rhinometry. 
However, 
none 
of 
these 
methods 
has 
been 
widely 
accepted 
due 
to 
the 
lack 
of 
standardization, 
or 
due 
to 
difficulties 
in 
the 
implementation 
and 
execution 
of 
the 
method 
[5]. 
Acoustic 
rhinometry 
has 
been 
proposed 
as 
a 
method 
for 
the 
evaluation 
of 
the 
nasal 
airways 
and 
adenoids. 
It 
is 
a 
rapid, 
noninvasive 
and 
painless 
technique 
and 
requires 
minimal 
cooperation 
from 
the 
patient 
[10]. 


The 
objective 
of 
the 
present 
study 
was 
to 
compare 
the 
rhinograms 
obtained 
for 
children 
with 
adenoid 
or 
adenotonsil 
hypertrophy 
before 
and 
after 
surgery 
with 
those 
of 
children 
without 
respiratory 
complaints. 
The 
rhinograms 
were 
analyzed 
both 
automatically 
and 
manually, 
and 
these 
results 
were 
also 
compared.

Material 
and 
methods 
2.1. 
Population 
Thirty-five 
children 
(ranging 
in 
age 
from 
2 
to 
15 
years, 
mean 
6 
years; 
22 
boys 
and 
13 
girls), 
seen 
at 
the 
Children’s 
Rhinosinusology 
Outpatient 
Clinic, 
with 
known 
respiratory 
alterations 
due 
to 
adenoid 
and/or 
tonsil 
hypertrophy 
as 
shown 
by 
cavum 
X-ray 
and/or 
nasal 
endoscopy, 
with 
a 
surgical 
indication 
of 
adenoidectomy 
and/or 
adenotonsillectomy, 
were 
assessed 
before 
and 
within 
an 
interval 
of 
30—60 
days 
after 
surgery. 


The 
children 
were 
submitted 
to 
clinical 
evaluation 
and 
anterior 
rhinoscopy, 
followed 
by 
acoustic 
rhinometry. 
Eighteen 
children 
(nine 
boys 
and 
nine 
girls 
ranging 
in 
age 
from 
3 
to 
12 
years) 
ac


companying 
patients 
seen 
at 
the 
otorhinolaryngology 
outpatient 
clinics 
of 
the 
same 
hospital 
without 
a 
clinical 
history 
of 
nasal 
obstruction, 
frequent 
rhinorrhea, 
itchy 
nose, 
sternutatory 
crises, 
or 
substitute 
mouth 
breathing, 
and 
without 
alterations 
upon 
physical 
examination 
such 
as 
septal 
deviation, 
inferior 
turbinate 
hypertrophy 
or 
elongated 
faces, 
were 
submitted 
to 
the 
same 
procedures 
and 
used 
as 
controls. 


2.2. 
Rhinometric 
examination 
Acoustic 
rhinometry 
was 
carried 
out 
with 
an 
SR2000 
Rhinometrics 
apparatus 
(Denmark) 
equipped 
with 
nasal 
adaptors 
of 
variable 
size 
according 
to 
the 
size 
of 
the 
nostril 
of 
the 
patient 
(mini-probe, 
medium 
probe 
and 
large 
probe). 


Acoustic 
rhinometry 
was 
carried 
out 
without 
a 
vasoconstrictor 
and 
15 
min 
after 
the 
application 
of 
two 
0.25% 
ephedrine 
streams 
into 
each 
nostril. 
The 
test 
was 
performed 
in 
an 
acoustically 
adequate 
environment, 
with 
control 
of 
the 
following 
factors 
according 
to 
the 
Standards 
of 
the 
International 
Committee 
on 
Acoustic 
Rhinometry 
[11] 
in 
order 
to 
guarantee 
the 
accuracy 
of 
the 
test: 
(a) 
the 
patients 
remained 
in 
the 
air-conditioned 
room 
(temperature 
of 
21 
.C) 
for 
30 
min 
before 
the 
measurement, 


(b) 
temperature 
and 
humidity 
were 
kept 
at 
21 
.C 
and 
50—60%, 
respectively, 
(c) 
stabilization 
of 
the 
patient’s 
head, 
(d) 
position 
of 
the 
wave 
tube, 
(e) 
use 
of 
vaseline 
to 
prevent 
leakage, 
and 
(f) 
control 
of 
respiration. 
In 
order 
to 
guarantee 
the 
accuracy 
of 
the 
test, 
at 
least 
three 
curves 
were 
obtained 
for 
each 
exam 
and 
nostril. 
After 
each 
measurement, 
the 
nasal 
adaptor 
was 
removed 
from 
the 
nostril 
and 
reconnected 
and 
a 
new 
measurement 
was 
then 
obtained. 
The 
results 
were 
considered 
to 
be 
adequate 
when 
the 
coefficient 
of 
variation 
was 
less 
than 
10%. 
A 
mean 
curve 
for 
each 
nostril 
was 
then 
constructed 
for 
each 
patient 
based 
on 
the 
recorded 
curves. 
All 
exams 
were 
carried 
out 
by 
the 
same 
observer. 


The 
study 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
Institutional 
Ethics 
Committee 
and 
informed 
consent 
was 
obtained 
from 
the 
parents 
of 
each 
child 
on 
the 
occasion 
of 
the 
first 
examination. 


2.3. 
Surgery 
The 
patients 
were 
submitted 
to 
adenoidectomy 
(N 
= 
16) 
or 
adenotonsillectomy 
(N 
= 
19) 
as 
indicated 
in 
each 
case. 
The 
surgeries 
were 
performed 
at 
the 
University 
Hospital, 
Faculty 
of 
Medicine 
of 
Ribeirão 
Preto, 
by 
the 
otorhinolaryngology 
team 
of 
the 
same 
service.

Parameters 
before 
and

by 
the 
paired

with 
the 
level 
of 
significance 
set 
at 
>0.05. 
The

was 
used 
to

Results 
The 
age 
and 
sex 
distribution 
of 
the 
population 
submitted 
to 
surgery 
and 
of 
the 
control 
group 
is 
shown 
in 
Tables 
1 
and 
2. 


The 
acoustic 
rhinometry 
results 
were 
analyzed 
in 
two 
ways: 
(1) 
automatically 
with 
the 
notches 
values 
being 
provided 
by 
the 
program, 
and 
(2) 
with 
each 
constriction 
measured 
manually. 


An 
increase 
in 
minimal 
cross-sectional 
area 
(MCA) 
and 
nasal 
volume 
was 
observed 
for 
all 
groups 
after 
the 
use 
of 
the 
vasoconstrictor, 
including 
both 
the 
groups 
analyzed 
automatically 
and 
those 
analyzed 
manually. 
A 
significant 
difference 
was 
observed 
in 
both 
MCA 
and 
volume 
at 
the 
second 
(P 
= 
0.0027), 
third 
(P 
= 
0.0010) 
and 
fourth 
notch 
(P 
= 
0.0015), 
but 
there 
was 
no 
significant 
difference 
between 
measurements 
made 
without 
and 
with 
vasoconstrictor 
(P 
= 
0.1710) 
at 
the 
first 
notch. 
Significant 
differences 
were 
also 
observed 
in 
all 
groups 
for 
the 
three 
parameters, 
distance 
of 
the 
notch, 
MCA 
and 
nasal 
volume, 
when 
we 
compared 
the 
values 
obtained 
automatically 
and 
manually, 
both 
in 
the 
presence 
and 
absence 
of 
the 
vasoconstrictor 
(Table

Discussion 
Nasal 
obstruction 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
frequent 
complaints 
in 
clinical 
otorhinolaryngology; 
however, 
its 
quantification 
objective 
continues 
to 
be 
a 
challenge 
[4]. 
In 
addition, 
the 
measurement 
of 
nasal 
patency 
is 
important 
in 
the 
evaluation 
of 
both 
clinical 
and 
surgical 
treatments. 
Many 
patients 
who 
are 
submitted 
to 
nasal 
surgery 
continue 
to 
complain 
of 
nasal 
obstruction, 
with 
examination 
revealing 
a 
nasal 
cavity 
without 
alterations 
[9,12]. 


In 
children 
it 
is 
even 
more 
difficult 
to 
measure 
nasal 
obstruction 
and 
to 
make 
a 
definite 
topodiagnosis. 
Even 
a 
traditional 
X-ray 
of 
the 
cavum 
might 
provide 
erroneous 
information 
if 
not 
carried 
out 
with 
the 
adequate 
technique, 
while 
other 
imaging 
exams 
such 
as 
computed 
tomography 
and 
magnetic 
resonance 
are 
expensive 
for 
routine 
use. 
Rhinomanometry 
requires 
great 
collaboration 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
child 
and 
cannot 
be 
used 
in 
babies 
since

they 
cannot 
follow 
commands 
such 
as 
deep 
and 
paused 
respiration 
[13,14]. 


In 
this 
respect, 
acoustic 
rhinometry 
has 
brought 
new 
hope 
to 
the 
objective 
assessment 
of 
nasal 
obstruction 
in 
children. 
The 
method 
has 
been 
shown 
to 
be 
well 
accepted 
and 
to 
require 
minimum 
collaboration, 
is 
rapid 
and 
harmless, 
and 
has 
a 
high 
reproducibility 
and 
accuracy 
[3,15,16]. 


In 
the 
present 
study, 
all 
children 
evaluated 
were 
found 
to 
be 
highly 
receptive 
and 
collaborated 
during 
the 
exam, 
and 
none 
of 
them 
complained 
about 
pain 
or 
discomfort 
during 
the 
test. 


However, 
controversies 
continue 
to 
exist 
regarding 
some 
aspects 
of 
acoustic 
rhinometry 
such 
as 
the 
location 
of 
the 
notches 
[8], 
and 
the 
possibility 
or 
not 
to 
use 
this 
technique 
for 
the 
assessment 
of 
the 
posterior 
part 
of 
the 
nose 
and 
rhinopharynx, 
including 
the 
dimensions 
of 
the 
adenoid 
[1,10,12,17—19]. 
Variation 
in 
the 
location 
of 
the 
notches 
can 
be 
explained 
by 
the 
wide 
variety 
of 
nasal 
conformations 
and 
sizes 
among 
the 
different 
age 
groups, 
and 
by 
the 
use 
of 
different 
devices 
[11]. 


The 
existence 
of 
considerable 
differences 
in 
both 
external 
and 
internal 
nasal 
geometry 
among 
the 
various 
racial 
groups 
is 
a 
well-established 
fact. 
Racial 
origin 
can 
be 
predicted 
by 
the 
external 
configuration 
of 
the 
nose 
defined 
by 
the 
nasal 
index 
[20], 
and 
this 
evidence 
should 
be 
taken 
into 
account 
when 
comparing 
rhinograms 
from

In 
the 
Brazilian 
population, 
which 
is 
characterized 
by 
marked 
miscegenation, 
the 
establishment 
of 
normal 
patterns 
is 
as 
difficult 
as 
it 
is 
necessary. 


Riechelmann 
et 
al. 
[22] 
studying 
children 
aged 
3—6 
years, 
found 
MCA 
1 
values, 
which 
correspond 
to 
the 
internal 
isthmus, 
and 
MCA 
2 
values, 
which 
represent 
the 
head 
of 
the 
inferior 
turbinate, 
similar 
to 
those 
reported 
by 
Djupesland 
and 
Lyholm 
[10] 
who 
assessed 
1-year-old 
infants, 
with 
these 
findings 
suggesting 
that 
nasal 
airway 
geometry 
changes 
significantly 
during 
the 
first 
year 
of 
life 
and 
more 
slowly 
thereafter, 
with 
the 
geometry 
of 
the 
adult 
nose 
only 
being 
reached 
around 
8—10 
years. 


Our 
results 
regarding 
the 
depth 
of 
the 
nasal 
cavity 
are 
in 
agreement 
with 
those 
reported 
by 
Djupesland 
and 
Lyholm 
[10] 
and 
Cho 
et 
al. 
[4], 
with 
our 
sample 
of 
children 
with 
a 
mean 
age 
of 
6 
years 
presenting 
a 
depth 
of 
about 
6.7 
cm. 


Our 
population 
with 
nasal 
complaints 
ranged 
in 
age 
from 
2 
to 
14 
years, 
but 
the 
highest 
incidence 
was 
observed 
among 
children 
aged 
4—6 
years 
(54.28%), 
a 
finding 
coinciding 
with 
the 
peak 
growth 
of 
the 
adenoidal 
vegetation. 


Several 
studies 
have 
suggested 
that 
the 
first 
notch 
represents 
the 
nasal 
isthmus 
and 
the 
second 
notch 
the 
inferior 
turbinate. 
Kim 
et 
al. 
[23] 
defined 
the 
third 
notch 
as 
corresponding 
to 
the 
constriction 
of 
the 
choana 
and 
the 
fourth 
as 
corresponding 
to 
the 
adenoid, 
with 
the 
notches 
observed 
in 
the 
present 
sample 
being 
close 
to 
those 
already 
defined. 


The 
device 
used 
in 
the 
present 
study 
(Rhinometrics, 
2000) 
measures 
anterior 
constriction, 
with 
MCA 
1 
being 
defined 
as 
the 
smallest 
area 
between 
0 
and 
22 
mm 
and 
MCA 
2 
as 
the 
smallest 
area 
between 
22 
and 
54 
mm. 
Since 
our 
samples 
varied 
in 
age 
and 
size 
of 
the 
nasal 
fossae, 
we 
also 
opted 
for 
manual 
measurement 
of 
the 
constrictions. 
This 
was 
important 
since 
the 
adenoid 
of 
most 
children 
were 
measured 
about 
65 
mm. 
The 
results 
of 
the 
comparison 
between 
the 
two 
types 
of 
measurement 
were 
highly 
interesting 
since 
a 
difference 
was 
observed 
for 
all 
parameters. 
Since 
the 
program 
measures 
the 
minimal 
area 
at 
a 
given 
distance 
interval, 
it 
sometimes 
ignored 
the 
first 
notch, 
while 
at 
other 
times 
it 
measured 
the 
area 
at 
22 
mm 
irrespective 


of 
the 
presence 
or 
absence 
of 
an 
evident 
notch. 



Pre-and

evaluation

rhinometry 


Therefore, 
we 
believe 
that 
in 
children 
the 
manual 
measurement 
of 
constrictions 
is 
more 
reliable. 


Small 
alterations 
were 
observed 
in 
the 
distance, 
area 
and 
volume 
of 
the 
first 
notch 
before 
and 
after 
surgery 
as 
expected, 
since 
the 
region 
of 
the 
nasal 
valve 
contains 
little 
erectile 
tissue 
capable 
of 
ingurgitation 
during 
nasal 
obstruction. 
A 
wider 
variation 
in 
area 
and 
volume 
was 
observed 
for 
the 
second, 
third 
and 
fourth 
notches. 
Similar 
findings 
have 
been 
reported 
by 
others 
[8,10,12]. 


The 
fact 
that 
the 
area 
and 
volume 
of 
the 
second 
notch 
corresponding 
to 
the 
head 
of 
the 
inferior 
turbinate 
also 
increased 
after 
adenoidectomy 
has 
been 
attributed 
to 
the 
reversal 
of 
congestion 
of 
the 
inferior 
turbinates. 
This 
congestion 
is 
due 
to 
increased 
nasal 
flow 
resistance 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
an 
obstructed 
adenoid 
which 
results 
in 
reduced 
nasal 
airflow. 
A 
reduction 
in 
nasal 
flow, 
in 
turn, 
leads 
to 
a 
vasomotor 
reaction 
and 
consequent 
inferior 
turbinate 
hypertrophy 
[8]. 


Very 
narrow 
constrictions 
are 
known 
to 
be 
prone 
to 
measurement 
errors 
because 
this 
area 
is 
reduced 
after 
these 
constrictions 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
true 
area, 
this 
fact 
also 
suggesting 
that 
analysis 
of 
the 
posterior 
portion 
might 
yield 
unreal 
results 
[24]. 
Thus, 
in 
order 
to 
obtain 
real 
measurements 
in 
children, 
the 
use 
of 
nasal 
adaptors 
adequate 
for 
the 
size 
of 
the 
child’s 
nostril 
is 
necessary. 
In 
this 
respect, 
the 
development 
of 
the 
mini-probe 
and 
its 
validation 
were 
extremely 
important 
for 
the 
study 
of 
nasal 
obstruction 
in 
children 
[14]. 


Several 
research 
groups 
have 
reported 
divergent 
results 
regarding 
the 
possibility 
that 
acoustic 
rhinometry 
could 
be 
suitable 
for 
the 
determination 
of 
surgical 
indication 
(adenoidectomy) 
in 
children 
with 
nasal 
obstruction. 
In 
this 
respect, 
Fisher 
et 
al. 


[15] 
determined 
whether 
acoustic 
rhinometry 
permits 
surgical 
indication 
of 
adenoidectomy 
by 
comparing 
the 
rhinopharyngeal 
volume 
obtained 
with 
this 
technique 
with 
the 
volume 
of 
the 
adenoid 
measured 
at 
a 
surgical 
center/upon 
surgery. 
The 
authors 
concluded 
that 
the 
predictive 
value 
of 
acoustic 
rhinometry 
is 
low 
unless 
it 
is 
combined 
with 
clinical 
factors. 
Similarly, 
Grymer 
et 
al. 
[17] 
obtained 
results 
indicating 
that 
acoustic 
rhinometry 
alone 
has 
a 
low 
sensitivity 
in 
the 
prediction 
of 
nasal 
obstruction. 
Furthermore, 
Riechelmann 
et 
al. 
[22], 
assessing 
children 
before 
and 
after 
surgery 
by 
acoustic 
rhinometry 
and 
comparing 
the 
results 
with 
a 
control 
group, 
did 
not 
observe 
any 
difference 
between 
the 
preoperative 
and 
control 
group 
values, 
thus 
indicating 
that 
this 
method 
is 
not 
suitable 
for 
determining 
adenoid 
size. 
The 
present 
results 
also 
did 
not 
show 
a 
significant 
difference 
between 
the 
preoperative 
group 
and 
the 
control 
nor 
between 
the 
postoperative 
and 
con


trol 
groups, 
demonstrating 
that 
acoustic 
rhinometry 
alone 
is 
not 
suitable 
for 
the 
indication 
of 
surgical 
procedures 
in 
the 
pediatric 
population. 


On 
the 
other 
hand, 
a 
significant 
difference 
was 
observed 
between 
the 
pre-and 
postoperative 
values 
obtained 
for 
the 
second, 
third 
and 
fourth 
notch, 
a 
finding 
important 
for 
the 
follow-up 
of 
these 
patients. 


Millqvist 
and 
Bende 
[25], 
suggested 
that 
acoustic 
rhinometry 
is 
useful 
for 
interindividual 
evaluation 
but 
not 
for 
the 
assessment 
of 
different 
groups. 
Our 
results 
agree 
with 
this 
assumption 
since 
we 
observed 
significant 
difference 
between 
the 
same 
patients 
before 
and 
after 
surgery, 
but 
not 
compared 
to 
children 
without 
nasal 
complaints. 
It 
should 
be 
pointed 
out 
that 
the 
comparison 
of 
the 
present 
results 
with 
those 
reported 
in 
the 
literature 
is 
impaired 
due 
to 
the 
small 
number 
of 
studies 
involving 
children, 
since 
the 
nasal 
adaptor 
adequate 
for 
small 
children 
(mini-probe) 
was 
developed 
only 
5 
years 
ago 
and 
is 
not 
yet 
available 
at 
all 
research 
centers.

Conclusions 
The 
acoustic 
rhinometry 
has 
been 
shown 
to 
be 
well 
accepted 
by 
all 
children. 


In 
children, 
the 
manual 
measurement 
of 
constrictions 
is 
more 
reliable 
than 
the 
automatically 
measurement. 


There 
were 
no 
significant 
differences 
between 
the 
preoperative 
group 
and 
the 
control 
or 
between 
the 
postoperative 
and 
the 
control 
groups.
