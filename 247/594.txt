Study objectives: To determine the frequency, symptoms, and polygraphic features of sleep-
related breathing disorders (SRBD) in adolescents aged 12 to 16 years. 
Design: Cross-sectional study. 
Setting: Randomly selected secondary schools in the city of Seville, Spain. 
Participants: A general population sample of adolescents (n . 
101; mean [. 
SD] age, 13.2 . 
0.8 
years). 
Interventions: An 82-item questionnaire regarding anthropometric data and nocturnal and 
daytime symptoms suggestive of SRBD was administered. Symptoms were evaluated according to 
a 4-point frequency scale. Snorers answered “sometimes” or “often” in the question about 
snoring, and nonsnorers answered “never” or “rarely.” All subjects underwent an overnight 
cardiorespiratory polygraphy at home. 
Results: Twenty-nine percent of the subjects were snorers. Excessive daytime sleepiness was 
present in 14% of subjects, and sleep apnea was present in 3%. Polygraphy showed a respiratory 
disturbance index > 
10 in 18 subjects (17.8%), but concurrent symptoms highly suggestive of 
SRBD were found in only 2 subjects (1.9%). Snorers had higher waist-to-hip ratios and a higher 
frequency of witnessed apnea or labored breathing as well as higher values of respiratory events 
as compared with nonsnorers. However, oximetry data were similar in both groups. 
Conclusions: In a nonselected group of adolescents aged 12 to 16 years, the frequency of 
symptoms potentially associated with SRBD was similar to that reported for younger children. 
Snoring was associated with a higher occurrence of other nocturnal symptoms, a more central 
pattern of body fat distribution, and a higher respiratory disturbance index as compared with 
nonsnorers. Although polygraphic abnormalities were mild, two cases of probable SRBD were 
found with a prevalence rate of 1.9%. (CHEST 2001; 119:1393–1400)

tures of SRBD in adults and prepubertal children are 
also reasonably well established.9–11 In the adolescent 
population, however, as far as we are aware, the 
prevalence, clinical expression, and polysomnographic 
features of SRBD have not been previously 
examined. 

Some of the underlying factors in the development 
of SRBD in adults, such as obesity or a narrowed 
upper airway, could be present to a degree in 
younger subjects. Moreover, during adolescence, sex 
hormones, testosterone in particular, start to play a 
significant role in the development of muscular mass 
in the body, including the pharynx. 

Therefore, by detecting SRBD in adolescents and 
correcting these disorders whenever possible, the 
quality of life in these subjects can be improved, and 
preventive intervention (improving diet habits, correcting 
hormonal unbalances, or suppressing obstruction 
via orthodontia or corrective surgery of the 
upper airway) can be developed toward later manifestations 
of more severe sleep respiratory disorders. 

To date, there have been no studies of SRBD 
conducted exclusively in the adolescent age group. 
This study was therefore performed to determine the 
frequency, symptoms, and polygraphic features of 
SRBD in adolescents aged 12 to 16 years recruited 
from the secondary school population in the city of 
Seville, Spain. 

Materials and Methods 

Subjects 

Between May 1997 and June 1998, a cross-sectional study was 
carried out in a sample of adolescents of both genders ranging in 
age from 12 to 16 years. A total of 12 schools were selected at 
random using the official directory of public and private secondary 
schools in the city of Seville, Spain. The study was approved 
by an institutional review board and by the local education 
authorities. After a full explanation of the purpose of the study, 
written informed consent was obtained from those adolescents 
who voluntarily agreed to take part. Written informed consent 
from their parents or legal guardians was also obtained. No 
inclusion or exclusion criteria according to the absence or 
presence of a history of medical problems or chronic disease were 
established. The study included the administration of a questionnaire 
for the investigation of SRBD symptoms and measurement of 
anthropometric parameters, and an overnight home polygraphy. 

Questionnaire 

The questionnaire consisted of 82 items and was administered 
by a nurse at the adolescent’s home on the same night as the 
polygraphic recording. Questions were answered by the subject 
and by his/her parents or guardians. The following data were 
recorded: (1) demographics; (2) family history of obesity and ear, 
nose, and throat (ENT) disorders; (3) personal history of substance 
abuse, including alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking, 
past and current medications, obesity, ENT disorders, 

craniofacial anomalies, hypertension, and chronic neurologic, 
psychiatric, cardiac, or respiratory disease; (4) school performance; 
and (5) nocturnal and daytime symptoms suggestive of 
SRBD according to a 4-point frequency scale, from “never” to 
“rarely” (equal to or less than once a week), “sometimes” (twice 
a week), or “often” (equal to or more than three times a week). 
Anthropometric measurements included weight, height (in percentiles), 
BP, neck circumference (in the standing position at the 
level of the cricothyroid membrane), waist circumference (at the 
midpoint between the anterior superior iliac spine and the lower 
costal arch), hip circumference (at the level of the greater 
trochanters), and biceps circumference (with the subject standing 
up, with the arm relaxed and slightly separated from the trunk). 
The body mass index, defined as the weight in kilograms divided 
by the square of the height in meters, and the waist-to-hip 
perimeter ratio were calculated. Subjects weighing . 
95th percentile 
of their ideal weight for height and gender were considered 
obese. Subjects who did not agree to undergo polygraphic 
recording completed a few items of the questionnaire that 
included demographics, weight, height, history of ENT disorders, 
and main SRBD symptoms, ie, snoring, witnessed apneas, and 
daytime sleepiness. Snorers answered “sometimes” or “often” for 
the question on snoring, and nonsnorers answered “never” or 
“rarely.” Stoppage of breathing while sleeping, labored breathing, 
hyperextended head during sleep, enuresis, and mouth breathing 
were considered to be present for any answer but “never.” Other 
symptoms, such as nocturia, restless sleep, awakenings, excessive 
daytime sleepiness, headache, cognitive impairment, and behavior 
and temper alterations were considered to be present when 
subjects answered “sometimes” or “often.” 

Overnight Polygraphy 

The overnight home polygraphy was performed using a portable 
ambulatory device (Apnoescreen II; Erich Jaeger GmbH & 
CoKG; Wuerzburg, Germany) with continuous monitoring of 
oronasal airflow (thermistor), chest and abdominal respiratory 
movements (thoracic and abdominal belts), arterial oxygen saturation 
(Sao2; digital pulse oxymetry), heart rate (finger probe), 
ECG, body position (mercury sensor), and actigraphy (wristband 
with activity sensor). Tracheal sounds (microphone) were not 
registered. According to the characteristics of the device, data 
sampling was performed with a frequency of 128/s, and data were 
stored in a database every 0.5 s (LabManager V4.05; Erich 
Jaeger), which allowed the playback of 10-min sleep recordings. 
Analysis was carried out both automatically and manually. 

The following parameters were assessed: respiratory event, 
defined as a decrease in oronasal airflow below a fixed threshold 
(established in a value of flow whose intensity corresponds to 35 
bytes in the computer graphical scale) during . 
5 s; oxygen 
desaturation, defined as a drop . 
4% in Sao2 during . 
8s; 
cardiac event, defined as a change in heart rate of . 
10 beats/min 
over . 
10 s; and awakening, defined as . 
50% increase in the 
actigraphy curve. Cardiac events or awakenings were considered 
to be related to respiratory events and/or desaturations if they 
occurred simultaneously. Variables analyzed were total recording 
(sleep) time (TRT); total recording time in the supine position 
(TRTsp); Sao2 baseline, obtained from the automatic analysis 
during the first minutes of recording; Sao2 nadir (lowest value 
during TRT); percentage of TRT with Sao2 . 
90% (CT90); 
oxygen desaturation index (ODI), number of oxygen desaturations 
per hour in the manual analysis; and respiratory disturbance 
index (RDI): automatic analysis RDI (RDIa), manual analysis 
RDI (RDIm), and time in the supine position RDI (RDIsp).

Statistical Analysis 

All results are expressed as mean . 
SD when appropriate. 
Differences in the frequency of clinical and polygraphic variables 
between snorers and nonsnorers were analyzed with the x2 test 
(with Fisher’s Exact Test and Yates correction when necessary) 
and the unpaired two-tailed t test. 

Results 

Study Population 

Of a total of 327 adolescents interviewed at 
schools, 136 subjects (42%) refused to participate in 
the study. Of the remaining 191 subjects, 90 subjects 
(27.5%) refused to undergo overnight polygraphy 
and completed a few items of the questionnaire. 
Therefore, the study population included 101 subjects 
(43 boys and 58 girls) with a mean age of 

13.2 . 
0.8 years. Subjects who completed a few 
items of the questionnaire and subjects included in 
the study were similar in relation to the following 
variables: mean age (13.6 . 
0.7 years vs 13.2 . 
0.8 
years), male/female ratio (47/43 vs 43/58), weight 
(64.6 . 
20.1 percentile vs 68.3 . 
27.6 percentile), 
and frequency of snorers (11% vs 15%), of apnea 
while sleeping (5.5% vs 3%), and of excessive daytime 
sleepiness (20% vs 14%). 
Twenty-three of the 101 adolescents were obese. 
One subject was unable to answer the question of 
whether she snored or not. Of the remaining 100 
subjects, 71 subjects were classified as nonsnorers 
and 29 as snorers. Fifteen subjects (14.8%) snored 
“often” and were considered habitual snorers. Anthropometric 
data, frequency of nocturnal and daytime 
clinical manifestations suggestive of SRBD, and 
polygraphic findings are shown in Tables 1 and 2. In 
18 subjects (17.8%) there was an RDI (RDIm, 
RDIa, or RDIsp) . 
10. In 11 of these subjects, the 
RDIsp was the one . 
10. In 2 of these 18 patients, 
the symptoms were suggestive of SRBD (snoring, 
witnessed sleep apneas, and excessive daytime sleepiness), 
with a prevalence of SRBD of 1.98%. 

Snorers vs Nonsnorers 

The snorer group included 29 subjects who answered 
“sometimes” (n . 
14) or “often” (n . 
15) to 
the question about snoring, and the nonsnorer group 
included 71 subjects who answered “never” (n . 
62) 
or “rarely” (n . 
9). Both groups were similar in 
relation to mean age, gender, and neck circumference. 
Snorers showed higher mean weight 

(72.1 . 
27.1 percentile) and percentage of obese 
subjects (27.6%) than nonsnorers (weight, 66.6 . 
28 
percentile; obese, 21.4%), but differences were not 
statistically significant. The waist-to-hip ratio was 
significantly higher among snorers than among non-
snorers (0.82 . 
0.07 vs 0.77 . 
0.006, p . 
0.002).

respect to daytime symptoms, only cognitive impairment 
(questions 23, 24, and 25 of the questionnaire 
[Table 4]) was significantly more frequent in snorers 
(75.8%) than in nonsnorers (53.5%; p .

frequency of daytime sleepiness, headache, behavior 
dysfunction, and temper disorders was similar in 
both groups (Fig 2). 

Oximetry data (Sao2 baseline, Sao2 nadir, CT90,

Discussion 

Participation in the study was proposed to 327 
subjects; 191 accepted (participation rate of 58.4%) 
and 101 were included (acceptance rate of 30.8%). 
In two population-based studies12,13 in which only 
questionnaires were used for assessing the prevalence 
of snoring and SRBD, response rates of 65% 
and 97% were obtained. In two other studies6,14 in 
which polysomnography was performed, acceptance 
rates of 26.6% and 43% were similar to ours. A 
selection bias in our study seems unlikely because 
anthropometric data and frequency of main symptoms 
suggestive of SRBD showed a similar distribution 
between subjects who took part in the study and 
those who did not. 

In this group of 101 adolescents, we found that 
symptoms potentially associated with SRBD have a 
similar frequency to the one described for younger 
children. Snoring is associated with a higher frequency 
in other nocturnal symptoms and a more 
central pattern in body fat distribution. Although the 
oximetric parameters are similar in both groups, 
snorers have a higher number of respiratory events 
in polygraphy than nonsnorers do. In the whole 
group, we found only mild polygraphic abnormalities, 
but two cases (1.98%) of probable SRBD were 
detected. 

With regard to methodologic aspects, the use of 

polysomnography in subsets considered at high risk 
for SRBD according to questionnaire scores6,7 would 
have been inappropriate in our study since clinical 
features of SRBD in adolescence are unknown. For 
this reason, overnight polygraphy was performed in 
all subjects. The design of the questionnaire was 
similar to that used in other studies.12,15,16 On the 
other hand, the tracheal sound recording of the 
Apnoescreen II polygraph has been technically unreliable 
in our experience, so that in the present 
study, as in the study by Corbo et al,17 snoring was 
assessed from questionnaire answers. This was a 
limitation of this study, but we think that it is better 
to assess the frequency of snoring during some 
months or years by subjective means than to evaluate 
this symptom during a single night with a technique 
of doubtful reliability. In fact, the frequency of 
snoring is usually assessed from questionnaire answers.
18 Finally, the Apnoescreen II device is a 
cardiorespiratory polygraph designed for simplified 
home studies, and data on arousals or upper airway 
resistance cannot be obtained because neither neurophysiologic 
parameters nor intraesophageal pressure 
are recorded. 

It has been shown that snoring is influenced by 
age. Studies in younger children reported a percentage 
of snorers between 10% and 15.3%, with 7.3% 
being habitual snorers.13,19 The prevalence in adults 
is higher, between 4% and 29% in men and between 
3% and 14% in women.20 This study shows that the 
prevalence of snoring in the adolescent group is high 
(28.7%), although habitual snoring was detected in 
only 14.8% of subjects. Regarding the frequency of 
other nocturnal symptoms, it is difficult to compare 
our findings with results of other studies21–23 in 
which younger children with suspected OSA were 
included. Snoring, witnessed apneas, labored breathing, 
and hyperextended head during sleep are main 
symptoms reported in children referred for assessment 
of SRBD.21,23 Besides snoring, unspecific nocturnal 
symptoms were common in our series, which 
may be due to many causes other than SRBD. 
Sleep-related apneas were found in only 2.9% of 
subjects. This is a much lower percentage than that 
found in the polysomnographic study of Young et al6 
in adults, in which 9% of women and 24% of men 
fulfilled the minimal diagnostic criteria for the sleep 
apnea syndrome (an apnea-hypopnea score . 
5). 
That difference could be in part due to the fact that 
the majority of the adolescents sleep alone. In 
relation to daytime symptoms, cognitive impairment 
(learning disabilities) as well as temper alterations 
and abnormal behavior were commonly referred by 
adolescents and by their parents. It is not surprising 
that parents think that their adolescent sons and 
daughters show a lack of interest or are bad at paying

attention (Table 4). On the other hand, daytime 
sleepiness was found in 14% of the subjects. It is 
known that adolescence delays the “sleep-on” setting 
in the biological clock with a trend to go to bed and 
to wake up late, which cannot be done with the 
scholarly timetable, and results in a cumulative sleep 
debt, leading to adolescent daytime sleepiness.24 
Daily mean sleep time was 8.5 . 
0.7 h, which may 
be insufficient at that age. Most of these subjects 
cannot take a nap except during the weekend. By 
contrast, daytime hyperactivity is particularly frequent 
in younger children with OSA syndrome.25 

Polysomnography is the key diagnostic test for 
OSA. However, a full overnight polysomnography 
study is technically difficult and can be performed 
only by technicians in sleep laboratories. Other 
simplified methods have been suggested, especially 

for epidemiologic investigations.26 Previous studies16,27 
of our group have demonstrated the usefulness 
of polygraphic findings with the Apnoescreen II 
equipment for reasonably excluding SRBD when 
results of the test are negative. Respiratory events 
were quantitated as episodes lasting . 
5 s instead of 

. 
10 s accepted for adults,6,9 as we have previously 
observed that these shorter events can cause desaturations23 
and that they disappear from the polysomnographic 
recording after adenotonsillectomy in 
children with SRBD.28 The clinical significance of 
short apneas has been also emphasized by others.10 
Few data are available regarding normal respiratory 
parameters during sleep in healthy children and 
adolescents. Marcus et al10 studied 32 nonobese 
children and 18 teenagers and recommended that

hour of sleep should be considered abnormal. In the 
study of Acebo et al,29 in which 45 healthy and 
nonobese adolescents were included, normative values 
for the RDI were 1.3 . 
1.3 in boys and 1.1 . 
0.7 
in girls. In the present study, the mean RDIm 

(2.7 . 
2.4) was slightly higher, probably because we 
studied a nonselected population, ie, not restricted to 
healthy nonobese adolescents, and because children 
were not included. In agreement with previous 
observations30 in male adults, supine position worsens 
respiratory events in our series. Regarding Sao2 
values, the lowest mean value during TRT was 
89.6 . 
3.7%, which is lower than that reported by 
Marcus et al10 perhaps due to differences in the 
study populations. Sao2 nadir ranged between 77% 
and 95%, with values . 
80% in only two subjects. 
One of them was a snorer but had a history of 
asthma, and the other was a nonsnorer with no 
history of chronic respiratory disease and normal 
values in ODI and in CT90, so that it may be 
interpreted as an isolated fall of Sao2. 
Young et al6 found that 9% of female subjects and 
24% of male subjects had an RDI . 
5, but when 
SRBD was diagnosed according to the apnea-hypopnea 
index together with daytime hypersomnolence, 
the prevalence decreased to 2% in women and 4% in 
men. In our series, 18 of the 101 subjects (17.8%) 
showed an RDI (RDIm, RDIa or RDIsp) . 
10, but 
in only 2 subjects were there clinical features highly 
suggestive of SRBD (snoring, apnea while sleeping, 
and excessive daytime sleepiness). Thus, the estimated 
prevalence of SRBD in our group of adolescents 
was 1.98%. These results are similar to SRBD 
prevalence rates of 2.9% in healthy children 6 
months to 6 years old,31 and between 0.7% and 1.1% 
in children from 4 to 5 years old.7 

When the groups of snorers and nonsnorers were 
compared, differences in age in gender were not 
found. In contrast with adult SRBD with a clear 

predominance of snoring in men, in children there is 
an equal prevalence of affected boys and girls.7,13,32 
The fact that 62 of our subjects were . 
14 years of 
age could explain the results since sexual development 
is usually not complete at this age. We also 
found a tendency for a higher weight percentile, 
neck circumference, and obesity in the snorer group. 
Although the difference between both groups did 
not achieve statistical significance, it is interesting to 
highlight it because the relationship between these 
anthropometric parameters and snoring has been 
previously established in adults.33 With regard to 
waist-to-hip ratio, snorers had a significantly higher 
values than nonsnorers, which probably indicates the 
relationship between central obesity and snoring.34,35 
In the evaluation of SRBD-associated symptoms, it is 
important to consider that adolescents usually sleep 
alone, so nocturnal symptoms can go unnoticed 
except snoring. Anyway, in agreement with other 
reports,23,36 symptoms more closely related to 
SRBD, such as apnea, hyperextended head, or labored 
breathing while sleeping, were more frequent 
in snorers than in nonsnorers. The frequency of 
excessive daytime sleepiness was almost double in 
snorers than in nonsnorers (20.6% vs 11.2%), although 
the difference was not statistically significant. 
This fact probably means that factors other than 
snoring also influence the level of somnolence, like 
the degree of delay of the biological clock. In 
younger children7,37 and adults,1 the frequency of 
sleepiness was higher in snorers than in nonsnorers. 
In the present study, cognitive impairment (learning 
or concentrating problems) was also more frequently 
found in the snorer group than among nonsnorers, 
which agrees with the fact that snoring has been 
associated with a worsening of both the emotional 
situation and the cognitive sphere.12 

As it has been previously discussed, both groups 
did not shown differences in any of the oximetry

parameters, but snorers had a higher values of RDI 
indexes. However, even in the snorer group, these 
values are still within the normal range established 
by Acebo et al,29 who obtained a mean RDI of 1.3 
(SD, 1.3), which means that the upper limit would be 
3.9, and our average RDI for the snorers was 3.8. 

In summary, in a nonselected group of healthy 
adolescents between 12 years and 16 years old, 
symptoms potentially associated with SRBD showed 
a similar frequency to that reported for younger 
children. Snoring was associated with a higher occurrence 
of other nocturnal symptoms, a more central 
pattern of body fat distribution, and a higher 

RDI as compared with nonsnorers. Although polygraphic 
abnormalities were mild, two cases of probable 
SRBD were found with a prevalence rate of 
1.9%.
