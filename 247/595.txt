Summary. Few 
data 
are 
known 
about 
the 
effects 
of 
sleep-related 
breathing 
disorders 
(SRBD) 
on 
the 
cardiovascular 
system 
in 
adolescents. 
Forty 
healthy 
adolescents 
(mean 
age, 
13.7 
. 
1.6 
years) 
answered 
a 
questionnaire 
regarding 
symptoms 
of 
sleep-related 
breathing 
disorders 
(SRBD) 
and 
underwent 
a 
cardiorespiratory 
polygraphy 
and 
echocardiography. 
Echocardiographic 
data 
in 
snorers 
with 
polygraphic 
abnormalities 
suggestive 
of 
SRBD 
(positive 
group, 
n 
¼ 
29) 
were 
compared 
with 
the 
results 
in 
nonsnorers 
without 
polygraphic 
abnormalities 
(n 
¼ 
11) 
who 
were 
included 
in 
the 
control 
group. 
Ventricular 
dimensions 
and 
indices 
of 
left 
ventricular 
systolic 
function 
were 
within 
normal 
limits 
and 
were 
not 
significantly 
different 
between 
the 
two 
groups. 
Indices 
of 
left 
ventricular 
diastolic 
function 
were 
also 
within 
normal 
limits, 
but 
isovolumetric 
relaxation 
time 
(IVRT) 
was 
significantly 
longer 
among 
the 
positive 
group 
(72.5 
. 
8.4 
msec) 
than 
among 
the 
controls 


(65.1 
. 
7.9 
msec) 
(P 
¼ 
0.018). 
Multiple 
regression 
analysis 
showed 
that 
posterior 
wall 
thickness 
was 
predicted 
by 
a 
model 
that 
included 
cardiac 
events 
related 
with 
respiratory 
events 
and/or 
desaturations, 
and 
respiratory 
disturbance 
index 
(RDI) 
in 
supine 
position. 
Deceleration 
of 
early 
diastolic 
flow 
was 
predicted 
by 
RDI, 
percentage 
of 
total 
recording 
time 
with 
SaO2 
< 
90% 
(CT90), 
and 
age; 
the 
variability 
of 
isovolumetric 
relaxation 
time 
was 
predicted 
by 
a 
model 
that 
included 
RDI 
in 
supine 
position. 
We 
found 
a 
significant 
relationship 
between 
polygraphic 
parameters 
suggestive 
of 
SRBD 
and 
echocardiographic 
measurements 
of 
ventricular 
dimensions 
and 
diastolic 
function. 
Also, 
echocardiographic 
parameters 
suggestive 
of 
some 
degree 
of 
left 
ventricular 
diastolic 
dysfunction 
were 
found 
in 
snoring 
adolescentswith 
polygraphic 
abnormalities.

Cardiovascular 
complications 
of 
SRBD 
in 
the 
adolescent 
age 
group 
were 
not 
previously 
examined. 
This 
study 
was 
performed 
to 
determine 
whether 
the 
presence 
of 
habitual 
snoring 
and 
some 
polygraphic 
features 
suggestive 
of 
SRBD 
are 
associated 
with 
altered 
echocardiographic 
parameters 
of 
ventricular 
performance 
in 
a 
healthy 
adolescent 
group. 
We 
also 
analyzed 
if 
a 
relationship 
exists 
between 
polygraphic 
and 
echocardiographic 
parameters. 


METHODS 

The 
present 
study 
belongs 
to 
the 
second 
phase 
of 
a 
cross-sectional 
study 
carried 
out 
by 
our 
group 
in 
a 
sample 
of 
249 
adolescents 
of 
both 
genders, 
ranging 
in 
age 
between 
12–18 
years, 
the 
results 
of 
which 
were 
recently 
reported.10 
In 
total, 
30 
schools 
were 
randomly 
selected 
from 
the 
official 
directory 
of 
public 
and 
private 
secondary 
schools 
of 
the 
city 
of 
Seville, 
Spain. 
No 
inclusion 
or 
exclusion 
criteria 
based 
on 
the 
absence 
or 
presence 
of 
previous 
or 
underlying 
diseases 
were 
established. 
The 
study 
was 
approved 
by 
an 
institutional 
review 
board 
and 
the 
local 
education 
authorities. 
Written 
informed 
consent 
was 
obtained 
from 
adolescents 
who 
voluntarily 
agreed 
to 
take 
part 
and 
from 
their 
parents 
or 
legal 
guardians. 
The 
study 
included 
the 
administration 
of 
a 
questionnaire 
for 
the 
evaluation 
of 
SRBD 
symptoms 
and 
measurement 
of 
anthropometric 
parameters, 
and 
an 
overnight 
home 
cardiorespiratory 
polygraphy. 
In 
the 
second 
phase 
of 
the 
study, 
all 
snoring 
subjects 
with 
positive 
polygraphic 
findings 
according 
to 
criteria 
defined 
below 
(n 
¼ 
41), 
and 
a 
sample 
of 
40 
subjects 
randomly 
selected 
from 
the 
group 
of 
nonsnorers 
with 
negative 
polygraphic 
findings 
(n 
¼ 
112), 
were 
invited 
to 
the 
hospital 
for 
echocardiographic 
assessment. 
A 
final 
sample 
of 
29 
(71%) 
snorers 
with 
positive 
polygraphy 
(positive 
group) 
and 
11 
(27.5%) 
nonsnorers 
with 
normal 
polygraphic 
findings 
(control 
group) 
underwent 
echocardiography. 


Questionnaire 

The 
questionnaire 
consisted 
of 
82 
items, 
and 
was 
administered 
by 
a 
nurse 
at 
the 
adolescent’s 
home 
on 
the 
same 
night 
as 
the 
polygraphic 
recording. 
Questions 
were 
answered 
by 
each 
subject 
and 
by 
his/her 
parents 
or 


guardians. 
The 
questionnaire 
was 
described 
in 
detail 
elsewhere.10 
For 
the 
purpose 
of 
this 
study, 
snoring 
was 
the 
only 
analyzed 
nocturnal 
symptom 
suggestive 
of 
SRBD. 
A 
4-point 
frequency 
scale 
was 
used 
to 
assess 
the 
frequency 
of 
snoring: 
‘‘never,’’ 
‘‘rarely’’ 
(equal 
to 
or 
less 
than 
once 
a 
week), 
‘‘sometimes’’ 
(twice 
a 
week), 
or 
‘‘often’’ 
(equal 
to 
or 
more 
than 
three 
times 
a 
week). 
We 
considered 
snorers 
those 
who 
answered 
‘‘sometimes’’ 
or 
‘‘often,’’ 
and 
non-
snorers 
those 
who 
answered 
‘‘never’’ 
or 
‘‘rarely.’’ 


Anthropometric 
measurements 
included 
weight, 
height 
(in 
percentiles), 
body 
mass 
index 
(BMI, 
defined 
as 
weight 
in 
kilograms 
divided 
by 
the 
square 
of 
the 
height 
in 
meters), 
and 
body 
surface 
area 
(in 
square 
meters). 
Blood 
pressure 
was 
measured 
with 
a 
mercury 
sphygmanometer, 
after 
administration 
of 
the 
questionnaire. 


Overnight Polygraphy 

Overnight 
home 
polygraphy 
was 
performed 
using 
a 
portable 
ambulatory 
device 
(Apnoescreen 
II, 
Erich 
Jaeger, 
Wu¨rzburg, 
Germany) 
with 
continuous 
monitoring 
of 
oronasal 
airflow 
(thermistor), 
chest 
and 
abdominal 
respiratory 
movements 
(thoracic 
and 
abdominal 
bands), 
arterial 
oxygen 
saturation 
(SaO2) 
(digital 
pulse 
oxymetry), 
heart 
rate 
(finger 
probe), 
electrocardiography, 
body 
position 
(mercury 
sensor), 
and 
actigraphy 
(wristband 
with 
activity 
sensor). 
Every 
0.5 
sec, 
data 
were 
stored 
in 
a 
database 
(Lab4 
database, 
LabManager 
version 
4.05, 
Erich 
Jaeger), 
which 
allowed 
the 
playback 
of 
10-min 
sleep 
recordings. 
Analysis 
was 
carried 
out 
manually. 
The 
following 
parameters 
were 
assessed: 
1) 
respiratory 
event, 
defined 
as 
a 
decrease 
in 
oronasal 
airflow 
below 
a 
fixed 
threshold 
(established 
in 
a 
value 
of 
flow 
whose 
intensity 
corresponds 
to 
35 
bytes 
in 
the 
computer 
graphical 
scale) 
during 
5 
sec; 
respiratory 
events 
with 
a 
clearly 
central 
pattern 
(by 
analysis 
of 
thoracic 
and 
abdominal 
movements) 
were 
not 
taken 
into 
account; 
2) 
oxygen 
desaturation, 
defined 
as 
a 
drop 
4% 
in 
SaO2 
during 
8 
sec; 
3) 
cardiac 
event, 
defined 
as 
a 
change 
in 
heart 
rate 
of 
10 
beats/min 
over 
10 
sec; 
and 
4) 
awakening, 
defined 
as 
50% 
increase 
in 
the 
actigraphy 
curve. 
Cardiac 
events 
were 
considered 
related 
to 
respiratory 
events 
and/or 
desaturations 
if 
they 
occurred 
simultaneously. 
Analyzed 
variables 
were 
total 
recording 
time 
(TRT); 
total 
recording 
time 
in 
the 
supine 
position 
(TRTsp); 
SaO2 
baseline; 
SaO2 
nadir 
(lowest 
value 
during 
TRT); 
percentage 
of 
TRT 
with 
SaO2 
< 
90% 
(CT90); 
oxygen 
desaturation 
index 
(ODI, 
number 
of 
oxygen 
desaturations 
per 
hour); 
and 
respiratory 
disturbance 
index 
(RDI, 
respiratory 
events 
per 
hour). 
The 
RDI 
was 
also 
calculated 
in 
the 
supine 
position 
time 
(RDIsp). 
According 
to 
the 
results 
of 
these 
indices, 
polygraphy 
was 
considered 
negative 
(if 
RDI 
< 
5, 
RDIsp 
< 
10, 
and 
ODI 
< 
5; 
all 
criteria 
should 
be 
met) 
or 
positive 
(if 
RDI 
. 
5, 
RDIsp 
. 
10, 
and/or 
ODI 
. 
5; 
at 
least 
one 
of 
these 
criteria 
should 
be 
met). 



Echocardiography in Adolescents With SRBD 

Echocardiography 

Echocardiographic 
examinations 
were 
performed 
by 
a 
single 
cardiologist 
(M.J.R.-P.) 
who 
was 
unaware 
of 
the 
adolescent 
groups, 
using 
digital 
echocardiographic 
equipment 
(Acuson 
Aspen, 
Acuson 
Corp., 
Mountain 
View, 
CA). 
Appropriate 
transducers 
(3 
MHz 
and 
2 
MHz) 
were 
used 
to 
define 
cardiac 
structures. 
M-mode, 
two-dimensional, 
and 
Doppler 
echocardiography 
were 
performed 
from 
the 
standard 
views 
(long 
axis, 
short 
axis, 
apical 
two-
chamber, 
four-chamber, 
and 
subcostal) 
in 
the 
supine 
or 
left 
lateral 
position. 
Measurements 
were 
made 
over 
three 
cardiac 
cycles, 
and 
mean 
values 
were 
obtained. 
The 
standard 
M-mode 
measurements 
of 
left 
atrium, 
left 
and 
right 
ventricular 
wall 
thickness 
(LVW 
and 
RVW), 
inter-
ventricular 
septal 
thickness 
(IVST), 
and 
internal 
dimensions 
at 
end-diastole 
(LVD 
and 
RVD) 
were 
made 
from 
the 
parasternal 
long-axis 
view, 
as 
recommended 
by 
the 
American 
Society 
of 
Echocardiography.11 
Ventricular 
dimensions 
were 
assessed 
at 
the 
peak 
of 
the 
R-wave 
of 
a 
simultaneous 
electrocardiogram. 
Fractional 
shortening 
(FS), 
left 
ventricular 
ejection 
fraction, 
and 
cardiac 
output 
were 
derived 
from 
M-mode 
measurements.12 
Left 
ventricular 
mass 
(LVM) 
and 
left 
ventricular 
mass 
index 
(LVMI) 
were 
calculated 
from 
the 
M-mode 
tracings 
by 
the 
formula 
of 
Dubois.13 
Variables 
measured 
by 
Doppler 
echocardiography 
included 
peak 
early 
filling 
velocity 
(E), 
peak 
late 
filling 
velocity 
(A), 
E/A 
ratio, 
deceleration 
of 
early 
diastolic 
flow, 
and 
isovolumetric 
relaxation 
time 
(IVRT). 
Each 
parameter 
was 
measured 
at 
end-
expiration, 
and 
was 
averaged 
over 
five 
consecutive 
analyzable 
beats. 


Statistical Analysis 

Statistical 
analyses 
and 
the 
calculations 
were 
performed 
using 
the 
Statistical 
Package 
for 
the 
Social 
Sciences 
(SPSS) 
for 
Windows, 
version 
10.0 
(SPSS, 
Inc., 
Chicago, 
IL). 
All 
results 
are 
expressed 
as 
mean 
. 
standard 
deviation 
(SD). 
The 
nonparametric 
Mann-Whitney 
U 
test 
was 
used 
for 
comparison 
of 
quantitative 
variables, 
and 
the 
chi-
square 
(w 
2) 
test 
for 
comparison 
of 
categorical 
variables. 
The 
strength 
of 
the 
association 
between 
quantitative 
variables 
was 
assessed 
by 
Pearson’s 
product-moment 
correlation 
coefficient. 
Multiple 
regression 
analysis 
was 
performed 
to 
identify 
polygraphic 
variables 
that 
might 
predict 
echocardiographic 
parameters 
regarding 
ventricular 
dimensions 
and 
diastolic 
function. 
The 
following 
independent 
variables 
were 
entered 
in 
a 
stepwise 
regression 
analysis: 
age, 
sex, 
BMI, 
systolic 
and 
diastolic 
blood 
pressures, 
snoring, 
SaO2 
baseline, 
SaO2 
nadir, 
CT90,ODI,RDIm, 
RDIa,RDIsp,and 
cardiac 
events 
related 
to 
respiratory 
events 
and/or 
desaturations. 


Statistical 
significance 
was 
set 
at 
P 
< 
0.05.

None 
of 
the 
patients 
had 
a

of 
cardiovascular 
disease 
or 
was 
treated 
with 
cardioactive 
drugs 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
study. 
There 
were 
no 
statistically 
significant 
differences 
in 
anthropometric 
parameters 
and 
blood 
pressure 
values 
among 
patients 
in 
the 
SRBD 
group 
and 
controls 
(Table

As 
expected, 
respiratory

indices 
and 
ODI 
showed 
significantly 
higher 
values 
in 
the 
positive 
group 
than 
in 
controls 
(Table

Nadir 
SaO2 
was 
also 
significantly 
lower 
in 
the

group 
than 
in

Echocardiographic 
parameters 
of 
right 
and 
left 
ventricular 
dimensions 
were 
within 
normal 
limits 
in 
all 
participants 
(Table

In 
respect 
to 
echocardiographic 
parameters 
of 
left 
ventricular 
function, 
IVRTwas 
significantly 
longer 
in 
the 
positive

than 
in

vs. 
65.1

Deceleration 
of 
early 
diastolic

was 
also 
higher 
in 
positive 
subjects 
than 
in 
controls, 
although 
statistical 
significance 
was 
not 
reached 
(Table 
3b). 
If 
the 
40 
adolescents 
are 
considered 
as 
a 
whole, 
without 
taking 
into 
account 
to 
which 
group 
they 
belonged, 
respiratory 
events 
in 
the 
polygraphic 
study 
(expressed 
as 
RDI 
and 
RDIsp), 
and 
cardiac 
events 
associated 
with 
respiratory 
events 
and/or 
desaturations, 
showed 
a 
statistically 
significant 
correlation 
with 
echocardiographic 
parameters 
of 
morphology 
(posterior 
wall 
thickness) 
and 
diastolic

Multiple 
regression 
analysis, 
performed 
to 
identify 
polygraphic

that 
might 
predict 
posterior

showed 
that 
34.7% 
of

DISCUSSION 

Results 
of 
the 
echocardiographic 
parameters 
were 
within 
normal 
limits 
in 
all 
adolescents 
included 
in 
this 


study. 
However, 
snorers 
with 
abnormalities 
in 
their 
cardiorespiratory 
polygraphy 
showed 
a 
prolonged 
IVRT 
as 
compared 
with 
the 
control 
group, 
which 
may 
suggest 
that 
some 
degree 
of 
left 
ventricular 
diastolic 
dysfunction 
might 
be 
present 
in 
these 
adolescents. 
There 
are 
significant 
correlations 
between 
cardiorespiratory 
events 
and 
some 
echocardiographic 
parameters, 
which 
might 
suggest 
that 
SRBD, 
even 
in 
earlier 
stages, 
could 
have 
cardiovascular 
consequences. 


Several 
methodological 
issuess 
must 
be 
considered 
in 
order 
to 
interpret 
these 
results. 
First, 
a 
combination 
of 
clinical 
and 
polygraphic 
criteria 
was 
used 
by 
the 
definition 
of 
SRBD 
in 
adolescents, 
since

the

of 
all 
pathophysiological 
events 
involved 
in 
the 
occurrence 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
at 
that 
age 
are 
lacking.14 
Snoring 
has 
high 
sensitivity, 
and 
was 
chosen 
as 
a 
discriminant 
clinical 
feature 
because 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
this 
nocturnal 
symptom, 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
in 
pediatric 
subjects 
can 
be 
excluded.15 
Second, 
only 
obstructive 
respiratory 
events 
were 
taken 
into 
account, 
because 
the 
pathophysiologic 
effects 
of 
central 
apneas 
on 
the 
cardiovascular 
system 
would 
be 
expected 
to 
be 
slight. 
In 
the 
criteria 
of 
cardiorespiratory 
polygraphy, 
minimal 
duration 
of 
respiratory 
events 
was 
established 
at 
5 
sec, 
because 
oximetric 
repercussions 
of 
these 
short-
lasting 
episodes 
were 
previously 
demonstrated.16 
Moreover, 
cardiac 
events 
associated 
with 
respiratory 
events 
and/or 
desaturations 
were 
included 
in 
the 
polygraphic 
parameters, 
because 
it 
was 
shown 
that 
analysis 
of 
variability 
of 
heart 
rate 
is 
an 
adequate 
procedure 
for 
detecting 
autonomic 
arousals17 
that 
may 
have 
more 
hemodynamic 
repercussions 
than 
apnea-related 
cortical 
arousals 
in 
children,18 
and 
may 
be 
even 
more 
closely 
associated 
with 
changes 
in 
blood 
pressure 
during 
wakefulness 
than 
oximetry 
parameters.19

function 
was 
studied 
by 
echo-Doppler, 
because 
diastolic 
dysfunction 
is 
increasingly 
recognized 
as 
a 
cause 
of 
heart 
failure.20 
Furthermore, 
Doppler 
echocardiography 
is 
a 
sensitive, 
well-established, 
and 
reliable 
method 
of 
assessing 
left 
ventricular 
diastolic 
function.21 


Chronic 
cardiovascular 
complications 
of 
OSAS 
have 
been 
extensively 
documented,22–24 
but 
there 
is 
much 
uncertainty 
about 
the 
causal 
relationship 
of 
sleep 
apnea 
and 
cardiovascular 
morbidity 
including 
coronary 
heart 
disease, 
or 
left 
ventricular 
hypertrophy 
due 
to 
difficulties 
involved 
in 
controlling 
for 
the 
many 
confounding 
factors 
that 
are 
associated 
with 
these 
conditions. 
However, 
recent 
epidemiological 
studies 
strongly 
support 
a 
causal 
role 
for 
sleep 
apnea 
in 
the 
development 
of 
hypertension 
in 
affected 
individuals.7,25 
In 
this 
respect, 
our 
study 
population 
was 
free 
of 
hypertension 
and 
other 
comorbid 
conditions, 
e.g., 
pulmonary 
disease. 
Adolescence 
is 
an 
appropriate 
age 
for 
investigating 
the 
cardiovascular 
complications 
of 
SRBD 
because 
of 
the 
lack 
of 
comorbid 
conditions 
and 
the 
short 
evolution 
time 
of 
these 
disorders. 


Right 
ventricular 
hypertrophy 
in 
OSAS 
patients 
may 
occur 
as 
a 
consequence 
of 
pulmonary 
hypertension 
secondary 
to 
transient 
hypoxemia,26 
but 
the 
presence 
of 
an 
obstructive 
ventilatory 
pattern, 
together 
with 
daytime 
hypoxemia, 
seems 
to 
be 
necessary.5 
In 
children, 
although 
cor 
pulmonale 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
without 
lung 
disease 
has 
been 
documented, 
most 
of 
these 
cases 
had 
severe 
degrees 
of 
SRBD, 
with 
hypoxemia 
and 
cardiac 
alterations 
such 
as 
pulsus 
paradoxus.6 
In 
our 
study, 
as 
could 
be 
expected 
due 
to 
the 
mild 
degrees 
of 
SRBD 
and 
the 
lack 
of 
associated 
obstructive 
lung 
disease, 
no 
right 
ventricular 
morphological 
abnormalities 
were 
detected. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
echocardiographic 
measurements 
of 
left 
ventricular 
dimensions 
were 
within 
normal 
limits.27 
In 
adults 
with 
OSAS, 
left 
ventricular 
hypertrophy 
has 
been 
described,28 
and 
it 
has 
been 
linked 
to 
an 
increase 
in 
afterload 
resulting 
from 
frequent 
episodes 
of 
hypoxia 
and 
arousal 
responses 
induced 
by 
apnea.29 
Hypertension, 
however, 
seems 
to 
be 
another 
important 
factor 
in 
the 
development 
of 
hypertrophy 
in 
patients 
with 
OSAS.4,27,29 
Recently, 
Amin 
et 
al. 
found 
that 
OSAS 
causes 
changes 
in 
right 
and 
left 
ventricle 
morphology 
and 
left 
ventricular 
hypertrophy 
in 
children 
and 
adolescents 
(range, 
2– 
18 
years).30 
In 
this 
study, 
a 
significant 
relationship

significantly 
more 
affected 
in 
severe 
OSAS 
than 
in 
subjects 
with 
milder 
disease.28 
It 
might 
be 
hypothesized 
that 
respiratory 
and 
cardiac 
events 
may 
result 
in 
hemodynamic 
changes 
able 
to 
modify 
left 
ventricular 
dimensions. 
These 
events, 
however, 
might 
be 
insufficient 
for 
an 
objective 
assessment 
of 
altered 
ventricular 
dimensions, 
due 
to 
the 
mild 
form 
of 
SRBD 
and 
the 
short 
time-course 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
in 
our 
group 
of 
adolescents. 
In 
concordance 
with 
this, 
we 
found 
that 
oximetry 
variables 
did 
not 
correlate 
with 
echocardiographic 
parameters 
(see 
Table 
4), 
and 
this 
might 
be 
because 
oximetric 
alterations 
were 
mild 
in 
both 
groups 
of 
these 
adolescents 
(Table 
2). 


There 
have 
been 
conflicting 
results 
with 
regard 
to 
investigations 
on 
left 
ventricular 
systolic 
function 
in 
patients 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea.31,32 
Since 
impairment 
of 
left 
ventricular 
diastolic 
performance 
often 
precedes 
systolic 
abnormalities,32,33 
echo-Doppler 
measurements 
of 
systolic 
function 
in 
our 
study 
were 
within 
normal 
limits, 
and 
there 
were 
no 
differences 
between 
subjects 
in 
the 
positive 
group 
and 
controls. 
In 
relation 
to 
left 
ventricular 
diastolic 
dysfunction, 
snorers 
with 
abnormalities 
in 
the 
cardiorespiratory 
polygraphy 
showed 
a 
prolonged 
IVRT 
as 
compared 
with 
nonsnorers 
with 
negative 
polygraphic 
findings, 
which 
may 
suggest 
that 
some 
degree 
of 
left 
ventricular 
diastolic 
dysfunction 
might 
be 
present 
in 
subjects 
with 
positive 
polygraphy. 
The 
relationship 
between 
SRBD 
and 
prolonged 
IVRT 
in 
the 
group 
of 
snorers 
with 
positive 
polygraphy 
seems 
plausible. 
None 
of 
the 
subjects 
included 
in 
this 
study 
had 
a 
history 
of 
cardiovascular 
disease, 
and 
other 
factors 
that 
may 
influence 
IVRT 
(e.g., 
age 
and 
obesity) 
were 
not 
significantly 
different 
between 
the 
two 
groups. 
Furthermore, 
respiratory 
events 
correlated 
significantly 
with 
IVRT, 
as 
well 
as 
with 
deceleration 
of 
early 
diastolic 
flow. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
results 
of 
the 
multiple 
regression 
analysis 
showed 
that 
a 
significant 
percentage 
of 


the 
respiratory 
events. 
These 
findings 
agree 
with 
the 
study 
of 
Kraiczi 
et 
al., 
who 
found 
a 
relationship 
between 
severity 
of 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
and 
deterioration 
of 
diastolic 
ventricular 
function.34 
Likewise, 
our 
results 
are 
consistent 
with 
a 
recent 
study 
in 
OSAS 
patients 
without 
hypertension 
or 
underlying 
heart 
disease,3 
in 
which 
left 
ventricular 
diastolic 
dysfunction 
improved 
after 
treatment 
with 
continuous 
positive 
airway 
pressure 
(CPAP).3,35 
It 
was 
shown 
that 
in 
children 
with 
SRBD, 
cardiac 
alterations 
disappeared 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
or 
CPAP 
treatment.36,37 


In 
conclusion, 
in 
a 
healthy 
adolescent 
group 
with 
snoring 
and 
polygraphic 
abnormalities 
suggestive 
of 
sleep-
disordered 
breathing, 
some 
degree 
of 
left 
ventricular 
diastolic 
dysfunction 
was 
suspected 
echocardiographically. 
There 
are 
significant 
correlations 
between 
polygraphic 
events 
suggestive 
of 
SRBD 
and 
some 
echocardiographic 
parameters 
of 
morphology 
and 
diastolic 
ventricular 
function, 
which 
might 
suggest 
that 
there 
is 
a 
pathophysiologic 
relationship 
between 
SRBD 
and 
cardiovascular 
disease, 
the 
long-term 
impact 
of 
which 
is 
not 
yet 
known. 
Further 
longitudinal 
studies 
are 
required 
to 
elucidate 
the 
clinical 
significance 
of 
these 
findings.
