Summary 


Obstructive sleep apnea and hypopnea syndrome in 
children (osas) has an estimated prevalence of up to 3% 
and can be associated with neurocognitive and behavioural 
abnormalities, and also cardiovascular complications. 
This study may help pediatricians, who are unaware of 
the problem, to recognize osas. Study design: series of 
cases. Aim: to describe the clinical characteristics and 
polysomnographic respiratory findings in a population 
of children with obstructive sleep apnea and hypopnea 
syndrome referred to the sleep laboratory from january 2002 
up to july 2003. Methods: we studied 93 patients between 
2 and 10 years of age with polysomnographic diagnosis 
of obstructive sleep apnea and hypopnea syndrome. Age, 
gender, racial group and questions about the children’s 
health and sleep related disorders were evaluated. Apneahypopnea 
index, oxyhemoglobin desaturation, and arousal 
index were evaluated too. Results: males represented 61.3%, 
With a mean age of 5.2 ± 2.1 (Years-old). The complaints that 
most commonly lead to the exams were snoring in 24.7% 
And restless sleep in 24.7%. Associated medical conditions 
frequently reported were allergic rhinitis (98.9%) And adenoid 
hypertrophy (50.6%). Mild apnea was found in 66%. The 
mean and sd of spo2 nadir was 89.1 ± 3.5% And the mean 
and sd of the number of arousals was 8.4 ± 3.5/ Hour of sleep. 
Conclusion: the results suggest the possibility that obstructive 
sleep apnea and hypopnea syndrome should be suspected 
in children with allergic diseases and adenoid and tonsil 
hypertrophy with snoring and restless sleep complaints.

INTRODUCTION 


The first report of sleep-related respiratory disorders 
in children was made in 1836, when Charles Dickens in 
his book: “The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club”1, 
described a 10 year old boy who spent most of his time 
eating and sleeping, similar description of some current 
reports of patients with Obstructive Sleep Hypopnea/Apnea 
Syndrome (OSHAS). Sir William Osler2, in his medical 
textbook from 1892, described childhood OSHAS, discussing 
daily symptoms and the extremely disturbed sleep 
patterns of these children. 

In 1976, Guilleminault et al.3 described a series of 
eight children with sleep apnea, diagnosed by polysomnography. 
Five years later, Guilleminault et al.4 published 
a review paper describing 50 children and teenagers with 
obstructive sleep apnea, concluding that the syndrome was 
not so rare and its cardiovascular and intellectual impact 
should be considered. 

Childhood OSHAS is characterized by recurring episodes 
of upper airway complete and/or partial obstruction 
during sleep, resulting in intermittent hypoxemia and hypercapnia, 
frequent awakings and sleep pattern breaks5,6. It 
is a severe condition in children and differs from its adult 
counterpart in its physiology, clinical presentation, polysomnographic 
characteristics and sequels. The estimated 
prevalence is of 1 to 3% in children; however, it is difficult 
to measure it, because of subdiagnosis6-10. Lack of community 
awareness about the negative sleep-related effects 
on children daily functioning together with parents underestimation 
of the problem when they talk to the physician 
are factors that contribute to this underestimation7. 

The most prevalent age group is in pre-school age 
children, between 3 and 5 years -time of the greatest 
lymphoid tissue growth, and also in adolescence7,8. Its 
etiology is multifactorial and is specially associated to 
adenotonsillar hypertrophy8,9. There is no Brazilian data 
about OSHAS prevalence in children. 

The most common complaints are snoring and difficulty 
to breath during sleep; some children may present 
difficult and noisy breathing11. Obesity is a risk factor for 
OSHAS, however most of the children with this problem 
are not obese18. A great number of apneic children, when 
awake show completely normal physical exam, and this 
also contributes to diagnosis delay17. 

The gold standard test for OSHAS diagnosis is the 
night time polysomnography; because the patient’s clinical 
history alone is not enough to establish a definitive 
diagnosis9. 

Treatment advocated for most children with OSHAS 
and adenotonsillar hypertrophy, without other diseases, 
is adenotonsillectomy. Notwithstanding, many of the 
operated children may have symptom recurrence during 
adolescence11. When surgery fails, we usually indicate Up


per Airway Continuous Positive Pressure therapy (CPAP)12 . 
Long term childhood prognosis is unknown5. 

This study proposed to assess the clinical findings 
and polysomnographic respiratory indices, documented 
by polysomnography, in OSHAS children studied in a 
sleep lab. The goal is to contribute to facilitate the OSHAS 
diagnosis for pediatricians and revise indication criteria for 
polysomnographic studies based on clinical data. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 


The present paper is a descriptive study, case series 
with retrospective polysomnographic data collection. 
Our sample was non-probabilistic and made up of 93 
children with OSHAS, between two and ten years of age, 
who underwent polysomnographic exam at the Hospital 
Português Sleep Lab, seen between January 2002 and July 
2003. Exclusion criteria included: children below two years 
and above 10 years of age; genetic disease, cerebral palsy, 
neuromuscular diseases or any other systemic disease. Following 
the identification of those children that matched 
the inclusion criteria, the parents were asked to participate 
in the study. If they consented, they were asked to 
fill out a detailed questionnaire prepared by the authors, 
based on questionnaires presented in the literature13,14. In 
this questionnaire, demographic and medical data were 
assessed, as well as details about problems related to the 
child’s sleep patterns in the last year. Among many other 
issues, the questionnaire asked if the child snored during 
sleep, if the sleep was restless, if there were respiratory 
pauses, behavioral problems or problems with school 
learning. Behavioral problems were considered present if 
a positive answer were obtained for any of the following 
questions: “Has anyone ever considered your child aggressive?” 
Learning problems were considered if a positive 
answer were given to the following question: “Does your 
child’s teacher think your child has learning disorders at 
school?” Presence of asthma, rhinitis, adenoid hypertrophy, 
tonsils hypertrophy was considered as positive 
answers to the questions: “In the last year was your child 
diagnosed with asthma? Rhinitis? Adenoid Hypertrophy? 
Tonsils hypertrophy? 

The children were classified in two age-ranges: 
children with five years or less, and those children above 
five years of age, because at five years we see the peak 
growth of lymphoid tissue6,10. 

In a nutritional assessment, growth parameters were 
obtained through standardized growth graphs from the 
National Center for Health Statistics. They were expressed 
according to the sleep lab experience where the research 
was carried out, using the modified Waterlow criterion, 
based on the height/age (H/A) and weight/height indexes 
(W/H). Children whom the adequacy percentage were 
³120%, were considered as classical obese. Eutrophic between 
³ 91% and < 110%; and malnourished were those

< 91%15,16. 

The standardized night time polysomnographic assessment 
was carried out at the sleep lab, using a 16 channel 
Respironics (Healthdyne Alice 4system) computerized 
device. The children were studied for a minimum period 
of 5 hours and maximum of 10 hours in a sound treated 
room, with light and temperature control, accompanied 
by one of the parents, without previous sedation or sleep 
deprivation. The reports were issued and revised by a 
sleep medicine specialist physician. The following tests 
were recorded: electroencephalogram, electro-oculogram 
and electromyogram (electrode on the chin and on one of 
the legs); and the following parameters were measured: 
movement of both the chest and abdominal wall, heart rate 
through a electromyogram and oronasal air flow through a 
nasal thermistor (Thermistor Airflow Sensor, 6210). Oxygen 
arterial saturation (SpO2) was assessed by means of a pulse 
oxymeter (Healthdyne Technologies Oximeter). Sleep architecture 
was assessed by the standard technique and the 
amount of time spent in each sleep stage was expressed 
as a percentage of the total sleep time. Central, obstructive 
and mixed-type apneas were recorded. Respiratory events 
were thus defined: central apnea was defined as a lack of 
oronasal airflow – measured by nasal thermistor without 
respiratory effort; central apnea with duration equal or 
greater than 10 seconds was quantified. Obstructive apnea 
was defined as the presence of chest and abdominal 
wall movements in the absence of oronasal airflow measured 
by the thermistor, of 5 seconds duration or longer. 
Hypopneas were defined as a 50% or more reduction in 
nasal airflow associated to the paradoxical movement of 
the chest and a 4% or more reduction in oxyhemoglobin 
saturation. The apneas with both components – central 
and obstructive – were classified as mixed apneas and included 
in the apnea/hypopnea index (AHI). The AHI was 
calculated through the total sum of obstructive hypopneas 
and apneas, plus the mixed apneas, divided by the total 
time of sleep17,18. Apnea and hypopnea values equal or 
above 1 were considered abnormal. Those children with 
AHI values between 1 and 5 events/hour of sleep were 
considered as having light OSHAS; moderate OSHAS were 
those with AHI between 5.1 and 10; and the severe cases 
were those with AHI ³ 10.1 event/hour of sleep18. 

Arterial oxygen saturation values below 92% and 10 
or more micro-awakenings/hour of sleep were considered 
abnormal11,19. 

In order to build the data bank and make the statistical 
calculations, we used the Statistical Package for the 
Social Sciences software. The continuous variables were 
expressed as average ± standard deviation, added to the 
median if the variable distribution were not normal. The 
category variables were expressed as proportions. We used 
the t Student test to compare the variables between the 
two groups for independent samples or the Mann-Whitney, 

according to the distribution of the variable considered. 
In order to compare proportions we used the Pearson 
Chi-squared or Exact Fisher test. The present study was 
submitted to and approved by the Ethics committee of 
Research with Human Beings of the Portuguese Hospital. 
The children guardians signed the informed consent for 
their inclusion in the study. 

RESULTS 


Table 1 depicts the demographics of the children 
with polysomnographic diagnosis of OSHAS. 

The adjusted Weight/Height variable varied from 
73% to 166% with average of 107.0 ± 16.4%. 7.5% of the 
children were malnourished, while 62.4% were eutrophic, 
12.9% were slightly overweight and 17.2% were obese. 
The average of the Weight/Height adjusted variable in 
both male and female children were, respectively, 108.5 
± 15.7% and 106.3 ± 17.5%, without statistical difference 
when both groups were compared (p=0.473). Assessing 
the children according to weight (children with normal 
weight and overweight children) and the degree of apnea, 
there were no statistical difference between the groups 
(p=0.462).

According to the parents’ response to the questionnaire, 
93.5% of the children snored at night; 88.2% had restless 
sleep and 54.8% had difficulty breathing during sleep; 
93.5% of the children had nasal obstruction during sleep 
and 64.5% were daily restless. Chart 2 shows de frequence 
of medical conditions associated to these children. 

Of the 93 children with OSHAS, nine had undergone 
surgical removal of lymphoid tissues, two underwent adenoid 
and tonsil removal and seven underwent adenoid 
removal alone. 

The HAI varied from 1 to 34.6 events/hour of sleep, 
with average of 4.9 ± 5.1 (median: 3.6) events/hour of 
sleep. As to the apnea severity, 69.9% of the children had

diagnosed as having severe apnea. 

Minimum oxygen saturation varied between 79% 
and 97%, with average of 89.1 ± 3.6%. As to the number 
of micro arousals/hour, there was a variation of 0.1 to 47 
micro arousals/hour, with an average of 8.4 ± 5.9 (median: 
8.0) micro arousals/hour of sleep. 

The patients were also analyzed in two age groups, 
using 5 years as a cutting point. 53.6% of the children 
up to 5 years of age were males and in those patients 
above 5 years, 73% were males. In the groups with less 
and more than 5 years, the proportion of individuals of

both genders did not vary significantly (p=0.06). As to 
nutritional status variation, we observed that in the group 
of children aged below or equal to 5 years, 7.1% were 
malnourished, 60.7% eutrophic, 16.1% overweight and 
16.1% were obese; with the children older than 5 years of 
age, 8.1% were malnourished; 64.9% eutrophic, 8.1% were 
overweight and 18.9% were truly obese. The average of 
the Weight/Height adjusted variable found in children of 
5 years or younger was of 106.7 ± 14.3%; in the group of 
children above 5 years of age, the average found for this 
variable was of 109.1 ± 19.2%, (p=0.482), both are values 
found in eutrophic children. 

Table 3 depicts the general characteristics of children 
with OSHAS, according to age group. Light OSHAS was 
present in 66.1% of the children aged 5 years or less, and 
in 74.7% in those older than 5 years of age (p=0.509). 

According to gender, the boys aged 5 or less presented 
higher hypopnea and apnea indexes when compared 
to girls [6.7 ± 7.2 (median: 4.5) events/hour of sleep 
vs. 3.6 ± 2.7 (median: 2.6) events/hour of sleep; p=0.018]. 
In those children above 5 years of age, average HAI for 
girls was of 4.0 ± 2.4 (median: 2.7) events/hour of sleep, 
and in males it was of 4.4 ± 4.2 (median: 3.2) events/hour 
of sleep (p=0.837). The average of the minimum oxygen 
saturation in children aged 5 years was of 88.8 ± 3.5% and 
in those children older than 5 years of age, the average 
was of 89.4 ± 3.6% (p=0.419).

children with OSHAS, clinically stable, who underwent 
polysomnography in a sleep lab in the city of Salvador. 

We observed that 61.3% of the apneic episodes 
happened more to boys than to girls of the population 
studied. In adults it has been shown that one of the strong 
factors related to OSHAS predisposition is being male10. 
Redline et al.20 showed that in children, the gender did 
not influence much on the risk of developing sleep-related 
respiratory disorders, thus suggesting that the differences 
seen in adults may be hormone-mediated, having its influences 
in respiratory control and the distribution of body 
fat, and they would probably play a discreet role in preadolescent 
children21. 

Racial distribution analysis revealed that 85% of the 
population were brown and black. This is due to the fact 
that most of the people who live in Bahia State are brown 
or black. About 70% of the State population is made up of 
brown and black people, and this ratio is even higher in 
the city of Salvador (77.5%)22. Many publications reveal a 
greater prevalence of OSHAS in black children, and this 
is probably due to cranio-facial characteristics of African 
descendants20. 

The disorder prevailed in pre-school children, similar 
to data already published in the literature5,6,21. 

OSHAS children seem to have their growth 
impaired21. Most children in the present study were eutrophic 
and only 7.5% of the children were malnourished. 
Different ideas have been proposed to explain the low 
weight gain in OSHAS children, such as IGF-I depression 
during sleep and also the low caloric intake of patients 
with adenotonsillar hypertrophy23. 17.2% of the children 
assessed were obese. Obesity has been related to a 4 to 5 

fold increase in the risk of developing OSHAS in children, 
when compared to their non-obese counterparts20. 

Polysomnographies were mainly ordered by pneumologists 
and only 11.8% of the requests were made by 
pediatricians. Children with OSHAS may be seen by many 
specialists. Usually pediatricians are more visited because 
of indirect complaints of low weight/height development, 
and pneumologists because of snoring and labored 
breathing24. Often times, parents downplay their children’s 
sleep problems to pediatricians in medical consultations. 
Stein et al.25 assessed 472 children aged between 4 to 12 
years, and the parents of 10.8% of these children reported 
persistent problems related to sleep in the last six months; 
notwithstanding, less than 50% of these children’s parents 
talked about their children’s sleep during the medical 
consult. Smedje et al.26 have shown that, although sleep 
problems were common in a population of 1844 children 
between 5 and 7 years of age, this issue was raised in the 
medical consults by the parents in only 6.7% of the cases. 
The reasons why the parents downplayed the sleep problems 
seem to be multifactorial. It is possible that this may 
have been influenced by memory biases, as well as by 
the limited knowledge the parents have in relation to the 
importance of potential OSHAS sequels in children, such 
as learning disabilities, disorders of the neurocognitive 
function and daily behavior. It is important to remember 
that the pediatrician, as he/she records the patient’s history, 
may also inhibit or downplay the parent’s complaints 
about their children sleep disorders. There is evidence 
that pediatricians may underreport sleep problems in 
children27. It is possible that sleep-related problems are 
discussed during the medical visit; however they are not

documented, nor duly appreciated. These findings, altogether, 
point to significant gaps in understanding sleep 
problems in clinical practice. 

Clinical manifestations found in this study are in 
agreement with literature data. The complaints that motivated 
the polysomnographic studies were mainly restless 
sleep, snoring, breathing breaks during sleep and labored 
breathing4,21,23. It was seen that breathing difficulty during 
sleep was an important symptom indicative of OSHAS, 
being more significant in children younger than 5 years 
of age. 

Snoring was reported for most of the children. OSHAS 
primary symptom is snoring and its presence indicate 
an increase in upper airway resistance. We noticed that 
children below five years of age snored more than their 
older counterparts. At this age, the adenoid tissue is still 
relatively large in relation to the size of the airway. In 
school aged children and in teenagers, the nasopharynx 
increases in size, while the lymphoid tissue remains stable 
or reduces in size, thus creating a larger airway28. 

Although the report of restlessness was subjectively 
evaluated in the questionnaire, most children were considered 
restless during the day, by their parents. Hyperactivity, 
aggressiveness and lack of attention, as well as memory 
impairment and learning disability are found in children 
with OSHAS; after being submitted to adenotonsillectomy, 
they improved, thus suggesting that neurocognitive deficits 
are, at least, partially reversible7,29. 

OSHAS was strongly associated to the presence 
of nasal obstruction and allergic rhinitis, referred by the 
parents in the population studied. Allergic rhinitis, commonly 
found in children, is an important cause of nasal 
obstruction. Nasal influence in snoring and obstructive 
sleep apnea is well known. 30 Physiopathologically, rhinitis 
causes nasal mucosa edema and mucous secretion 
that increase nasal resistance, thus predisposing the child 
to complete or partial obstruction of upper airways during 
sleep. It is possible that the increase in nasal airway 
resistance generates an increase in negative inspiratory 
pressure, thus causing a turbulence of lax soft tissue and a 
collapse of upper airway causing obstruction and OSHAS31 . 
McColley et al.30 showed that children with allergic rhinitis 
had more diagnosis of OSHAS when compared to controls, 
although they did not see differences as far as OSHAS 
severity is concerned. 

Even having polysomnography as a common 
procedure in children, reference values are yet to be 
standardized in the different pediatric sleep labs of the 
world. Due to the large amount of data obtained from the 
polysomnographic study, we chose to use three extremely 
important parameters only in this study: HAI, oxyhemoglobin 
saturation during sleep and the number of micro 
awakenings/hour of sleep. We also observed that the average 
of HAI corresponded to mild apnea and the indexes 

are much lower than those seen in adults with OSHAS, 
which reference values used to brand someone as apneic 
are defined as of 5 events per hour of sleep9. 

OSHAS severity interpretation requires the consideration 
of other respiratory parameters, such as oxyhemoglobin 
arterial saturation levels; the observed average of 
oxyhemoglobin saturation in children during sleep was of 

92.3 ± 2.4%, within the range considered as normal values 
by Marcus et al.18. The average of desaturation observed 
in our children was compatible to low intensity desaturation. 
As to the number of micro awakenings per hour of 
sleep, its average was similar to that seen in children with 
no respiratory disorder related to sleep in other pediatric 
sleep labs11,21. 
The importance of this study is that its findings are 
easily generalized to other sleep labs in their daily practices. 
Patients here enrolled probably represented the children 
along the entire OSHAS presentation spectrum. One 
limitation is that it only assessed children with documented 
abnormality found in polysomnography, and this did not 
allow us to compare these children with the population 
without polysomnographic alterations compatible with 
OSHAS. The lack of a control group precluded the definition 
about the importance of each OSHAS-related finding. 
How frequent physicians from different specialties ordered 
polysomnography was certainly influenced by the greater 
advertisement of sleep labs made to pneumologists. 

CONCLUSION 


Most of the children analyzed in this study have mild 
intensity clinical signs, complaints of snoring, restless sleep 
and the feeling of suffocation during sleep, specially those 
below 5 years of age. Daily restlessness was frequently 
reported by the parents. Most of the children had nasal 
obstruction, and allergic rhinitis was the most frequently 
mentioned disease, followed up close by adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy. Most polysomnographic exams in this series 
were ordered by a pneumologist.
