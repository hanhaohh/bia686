OBJECTIVE: 
To study long-term changes in behavior after adenotonsillectomy 
for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in 
children. 
DESIGN 
AND 
SETTING: 
Prospective study at the University 
of New Mexico Children’s Hospital, Albuquerque, NM. 
METHODS: 
Children with polysomnography-proven OSAS underwent 
adenotonsillectomy. The Behavior Assessment System for 
Children (BASC) was completed before surgery, within 6 months and 
9 to 18 months after surgery. Scores were compared using a paired 
t 
test. A P 
value 0.05 was considered significant. 
RESULTS: 
The study population included 23 children. Preoperative 
mean BASC T scores were 50. Children showed significant 
improvement after adenotonsillectomy in aggression, atypicality, 
depression, hyperactivity, and somatization within 6 months 
and 9 to 18 months after surgery (P 
. 
0.05). The differences 
within 6 months and 9 to 18 months after surgery were not 
statistically significant. 
CONCLUSIONS: 
Caregivers report abnormalities in the behavior 
of children with OSAS. Behavioral abnormalities improve 
significantly after adenotonsillectomy and are maintained in the 
long-term.

bstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in children is 
known to be associated with behavioral problems. 
Children with OSAS have excessive daytime sleepiness1 
and are more likely to be hyperactive1,2 and have decreased 
school performance.2 These behavioral problems may improve 
when children undergo adenotonsillectomy.1-4 However, 
previous studies of the effects of surgical therapy for 
pediatric OSAS on behavior may be questioned on 2 

grounds. First, most of the previous studies used questionnaires 
or clinical evaluation rather than full-night polysomnography 
(PSG) for diagnosis of OSAS.1-5 Therefore, it is 
possible that children with primary snoring were included in 
these studies along with children affected by OSAS, and 
these 2 groups of children may respond differently to surgical 
therapy. Second, in most of these studies, children 
were followed for only a few months after adenotonsillectomy.
1,6 As a consequence, long-term improvements in behavior 
after surgery for OSAS in children remain uncertain. 

The Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC)7 
was used in a previous study6 to assess short-term improvements 
in behavior after adenotonsillectomy for OSAS in 
children. Other previous reports have used BASC for studies 
of attention-deficit disorders,8 the behavioral adjustment 
of children with cancer,9 and the detection of behavioral 
problems in children with diabetes.10 In the present study, 
PSG was used to diagnose OSAS in children and to grade its 
severity. BASC was used as a change instrument to examine 
improvements in behavior lasting approximately a year or 
more after adenotonsillectomy for OSAS. 

METHODS 


Approval for this study was obtained from the institutional 
review board of the University of New Mexico School of 
Medicine, Albuquerque, NM. Children who were referred 
to the Pediatric Otolaryngology Service with a sleep disturbance 
between July 1, 2000, and June 30, 2002, and were 
shown to have an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) greater than 
or equal to 5 by PSG were included in the study. Caregivers

were asked to complete an informed consent document before 
enrollment. Exclusion criteria included (1) children younger 
than 2.5 or older than 18 years of age; (2) children who 
previously had an adenotonsillectomy; (3) children with 
craniofacial syndromes, neuromuscular disease, developmental 
delay, or psychiatric disorders; and (4) children with 
an AHI less than 5. 

All study participants underwent full-night PSG,11 and a 
sleep medicine physician interpreted the results. The following 
techniques were used to measure the physiological 
parameters of sleep: electroencephalography with bilateral 
central and occipital leads, electro-oculography, electromyography 
with submental electrodes, and electrocardiography. 
Airflow was recorded through the nose and mouth by 
a nasal air pressure transducer, and end-tidal CO2 was measured 
as well. Thoracic and abdominal muscular efforts 
were measured by piezoelectric sensors. O2 saturation was 
measured by pulse oximetry, and tracheal sound was recorded 
using a microphone secured to the neck. Digital 
videotaping with sound recording was performed throughout 
the night. 

Obstructive apnea was defined as a cessation of airflow 
through the nose and mouth for at least 2 respiratory cycles 
with paradoxical chest and abdominal movements. Hypopnea 
was defined as a reduction in airflow through the nose 
and mouth with paradoxical respiratory effort resulting in 
either an arousal or an oxyhemoglobin desaturation of at 
least 4%. The AHI, defined as the average number of obstructive 
apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep, was used 
for diagnosis. OSAS was defined as an AHI greater than or 
equal to 5. Children with OSAS underwent a monopolar 
adenotonsillectomy. The tonsillectomy was performed with 
a combination of sharp and blunt dissection using primarily 
a blade electrocautery. Adenoidectomy was performed using 
suction ablation and cautery. 

There are separate BASC instruments for the following 
age groups: 2.5 to 5 years, 6 to 11 years, and 12 to 18 years. 
The BASC (2.5-5) is a 131-item instrument, the BASC 
(6-11) is a 138-item instrument, and the BASC (12-18) is a 
126-item instrument. Scores on the behavioral scales are the 
sum of responses to a variable number of questions or items. 
Each item is scored as follows: never occurs . 
0, sometimes 
occurs 1, often occurs 2, almost always occurs . 


3. The BASC composite scales are the following: the behavioral 
symptoms index (BSI), a measure of the overall 
level of problem behavior; externalizing problems; and internalizing 
problems. Each composite scale is made up of 
several behavioral scales that are weighted differently as a 
function of age. This weighting reflects the relative contribution 
of the individual behavioral scale to problem behaviors 
in different age groups. 
Raw scores on the BASC scales are converted to T scores 
that indicate the distance of the score from the norm-group 
mean. T scores have a mean of 50 and a SD of 10. Therefore, 
a T score of 60 indicates that the score is 1 SD above 
the norm-group mean. Children were divided into 3 groups 

based on preoperative BASC scores: normal, T score less 
than 60; borderline, T score greater than or equal to 60 but 
less than 70; and clinically significant, T score greater than 
or equal to 70. 

Caregivers were asked to complete the BASC before 
surgery (survey 1), within 6 months after surgery (survey 2), 
and again between 9 months and 18 months after surgery 
(Survey 3). T scores for BASC behavioral scales and composites 
were compared before and after surgery using a 
paired t 
test. A P 
value less than or equal to .05 was 
considered significant. Change scores for BASC behavioral 
scales and composites were analyzed further using repeated 
measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) to assess the importance 
of covariates. The categorical covariates used for 
the ANOVA were gender, age, ethnic group, parental education, 
parental income, and AHI severity. Children were 
categorized on the basis of age as 6 years or 6 years. 
The ethnic groups used were Hispanic or Latino, non-Hispanic 
or Latino White, Native American, and other. Parental 
education was categorized as some high school, high school 
degree, some college, college degree, and advanced degree. 
Annual parental income in dollars was categorized as follows: 
7,000, 7,000 . 
14,000, 14,000 . 
20,000, 
20,000 28,000, 28,000 35,000, and 35,000. The 
severity of AHI was categorized as mild (RDI . 
5 10), 
moderate (RDI . 
10 . 
20), or severe (RDI 20). SAS 
procedures (SAS Corp, Carey, NC) were used for all statistical 
analyses. 

A power analysis indicated that a sample size of 20 is 
adequate to detect a 10-point difference in BASC T scores 
with 80% power and .05. A difference of 10 in a BASC 
T score is equivalent to a difference of 1 SD from the norm-
group mean. Therefore, the present study has more than sufficient 
power to detect a clinically significant change in behavior 
based on BASC T scores. 

RESULTS 


The initial study population comprised 44 children. Caregivers 
for 21 children failed to complete at least one of the 
postoperative BASC instruments. As a result, the final study 
population included 23 children, 15 (65%) of whom were 
male. The mean age of the children at the time of inclusion 
in the study was 7.2 years (range, 2.5-14.8 years). Twelve 
children (52%) were Hispanic or Latino, 7 children (30%) 
were non-Hispanic or Latino White, and 1 child was Native 
American. Ethnicity was not identified in 1 child. The mean 
AHI was 14.1 (range, 5.2-88.0). Based on age-and gender-
corrected body mass index percentiles preoperatively, 1 
child was underweight, 12 (52%) were of normal weight, 2 
(9%) were at risk of being overweight, and 8 (35%) were 
overweight.12 

The mean interval between survey 1 and surgery was 2.4 
months (range, 0.8-5.8 months). The mean interval between 
surgery and survey 2 was 4.4 months (range, 1.3-4.8

T scores with 95% confidence intervals for BASC scales

scales postoperatively. For BSI, 8 children (35%) had a 
score that indicated borderline or clinically significant behavioral

children (9%) within 6 months of surgery but increased to 4 
children (17%) within 9 to 18 months of surgery. A similar 
pattern was seen for most clinical scales and composites. 
The exception was atypicality, which showed a decrease in 
the number of children with borderline or clinically significant 
behavioral impairment 9 to 18 months after surgery 
(Table 2). 

Preoperatively, each of the clinical scales included children 
with clinically significant behavioral impairment. Within 
6 months of surgery, only the clinical scale of depression had 
a child with clinically significant behavioral impairment.

depression, hyperactivity, and somatization had at least 1 
child with clinically significant behavioral impairment. The

number of children with clinically significant behavioral 
impairment did not return to preoperative levels for any of 
the scales after surgery (Table 2). 

A repeated-measures ANOVA was done to evaluate the 
effect of covariates including gender, age, ethnicity, parental 
education, parental income, and the severity of AHI on 
changes in the BASC behavioral scales after surgery. None 
of these categorical covariates contributed significantly to 
the observed changes in BASC behavioral scales or composites 
after surgery. 

DISCUSSION 


Adenotonsillectomy for OSAS has been shown to cause 
improvements in child behavior during the initial months 
after surgery.1,5,6 Long-term improvements in quality of life 
after adenotonsillectomy for OSAS have also been documented 
in previous studies.13,14 Flanary13 showed that all 
domains of the OSAS-18, a disease specific quality-of-life 
instrument,15 improved in the long-term after surgery for 
OSAS. Physical concerns and daytime problems improved 
the most and emotional disturbances improved the least. 
The conclusion was that emotional disturbances take longer 
to resolve than physical problems and that a longer follow-
up period was necessary to examine overall improvement. 
Mitchell et al14 showed that caregivers perceive a 
long-term improvement in quality of life after adenotonsillectomy 
for OSAS despite the fact that these improvements 
are more pronounced in the short term and are not uniform 
across all domains of the OSAS-18 survey. Improvements 
in daytime problems and emotional disturbances were maintained 
long term and consequently caregivers’ concerns 
were reduced. Mitchell et al14 concluded that, although 
some physical concerns returned approximately 1 year after 
surgery, they were not severe enough to affect a child’s 
quality of life. 

The present research using BASC shows that the BSI, a 
global measure of behavior, was abnormal in 35% of children 
who were included in the study. Only 9% of the children 
included in the study had an abnormal BSI within 6 months of 
surgery, but that percentage increased to 17% at 9 to 18 months 
after surgery. A similar pattern is evident for the behavioral 
scales of aggression, atypicality, hyperactivity, depression, and 
somatization. Thus, significant improvement occurs for all 
behavioral scales postoperatively, and this improvement persists 
in the long term, although to a lesser degree. 

Peak improvement in T scores for the scales of aggression, 
hyperactivity, depression, and somatization occurred less than 
6 months after surgery. When viewed from a different 
perspective, more children had borderline or clinically 
significant behavioral impairments over the long-term 
period as compared with the short-term period, and this 
applied to the majority of clinical scales and all the 
composite scales. This may reflect deterioration in a 
child’s behavior 1 year after surgery but equally may be 

a result changes in the caregiver’s proxy over time. 
Furthermore, the time course of improvements in behavior 
after surgery was not uniform for all the BASC scales. 
Mean scores for atypicality, defined as the tendency of a 
child to behave in ways that are considered odd or immature, 
continued to improve throughout the postoperative 
period. 

There are a number of limitations to this study. First, 29 
children (47%) were lost to follow-up, and it is not known 
whether OSAS affected behavior differently in this group of 
children compared with the study population. Second, difficulties 
in collecting a large number of children with PSG-
proven OSAS and a long follow-up period precluded a 
detailed analysis of different age groups. Therefore, it remains 
unknown whether OSAS affects behavior differently 
in very young children compared to early adolescents. 
Third, a control group was not available to compare the 
effect of surgical therapy with the natural history of untreated 
OSAS. Consequently, it is not possible to state with 
certainty that adenotonsillectomy is the actual cause of 
improvements in behavior after surgery. It is also possible 
that a return toward baseline values may represent regression 
toward the mean. Finally, the variability in the behavioral 
response of individual children to surgery for OSAS 
remains unexplained, although variability of this kind is not 
uncommon in studies of complex behavior.7A study of 
behavior with a larger sample of children might reveal 
covariates that account in part for individual variation in 
improvements after surgery for OSAS. 

In summary, the present study shows that many caregivers 
report abnormalities in the behavior of children with 
OSAS. These abnormalities most frequently relate to somatization, 
the tendency to be overly sensitive to minor physical 
problems or discomforts, and to hyperactivity. Most 
behavioral abnormalities in children with OSAS improve 
significantly after adenotonsillectomy and the improvements 
are maintained in the long term. Therefore, it is worthwhile to 
identify children whose behavior is affected adversely by 
OSAS. These are the children most likely to experience sustained 
benefits in behavior after adenotonsillectomy and documentation 
of their behavior may affect the decision to 
undertake surgical therapy.
