Abstract 

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between nocturnal enuresis (NE) and upper 
airway obstruction (UAO) in pediatric population. Material and methods: This study presents the results of our 
experience with 321 children who underwent adenotonsillar surgery. Results: Among 321 children who were operated 
on, 111 (35%) had NE. Seventy-four of the 111 children who had NE have been evaluated postoperatively. After a 
follow-up period of 3 months 47 (63%) patients were free of their complaints, while three (4%) of them reported 
decrease in the frequency of NE and 24 had no change in their complaints. Conclusions: We do suggest that UAO 
is probably a more common etiological factor in NE than previously recognised. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

1. Introduction 
NE is involuntary urination during night sleep 
[1]. The reported rate of NE is more than 5% in 
children aged 7 and 0.5% in adult population [2]. 
There have been several explanations which are 
related to the physiopathology of the NE. Nocturnal 
enuresis due to psychological factors in 
children is quite seldom [1]. Instead, it is caused 
by a hereditary delay in maturation of the somatic

mechanisms such as reduction of nocturnal urine 
production, relaxation of the bladder during 
sleeping hours, and a normal arousal to a full 
bladder which prevent the child from bedwetting 
[1]. Genetically, many families are compatible 
with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance 
[3]. When the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome 
(OSAS) in children with adenotonsillary hypertrophy 
has been studied, it has been observed that 
significant association between NE and OSAS 
existed at an incidence of 26% [4]. 

There are several studies concerning the relationship 
between upper airway obstruction and 
NE [4–11]. Aim of the this study is to find the 
answer of these questions:

1. What is the incidence of the NE among the 
children with UAO? 
2. Is there any relationship between UAO and 
NE? 
3. What is the effect of the surgery on NE of the 
patients with UAO? 
2. Material and methods 
The study involves 321 children, (174 males and 
147 females) that were operated on for UAO. 
Ages ranged between 5 and 16 years. 

A thorough clinical examination was performed 
with particular emphasis on the status of the chest 
and heart, including an ECG and chest X-ray. 
Blood biochemistry, complete blood count, urinalysis 
were also investigated. None of our patients 
had any urological organic pathology that 
may cause enuresis. The triad of mouth breathing, 
snoring and hyponasal speech in the presence of 
normal intranasal examination was indicative of 
enlarged obstructing adenoids [12]. 

A careful history of sleep disturbances such as 
choking or pauses (apneas), restless sleep, morning 
headaches was taken. The presence of all of 
these symptoms was accepted as sleep disturbance 
result from UAO. Information contributing to 
our database was acquired by interviewing patients 
and their parents 3 months after the 
surgery. The following questions were asked to 
the parents of the patients who had symptoms of 
enuresis: 

1. Prior to surgery, how frequently did your child 
wet the bed? 
2. After surgery did he/she stop bedwetting? If 
yes was this 
2.1. A complete stop? 
2.2. A partial stop? 
We classified our patients under three subgroups 
in order to record the degree of improvement 
in their bedwetting: 

Group 1: Patients with complete relief of NE. 

Group 2: Patients with partial relief. 

Group 3: Patients with no change in their 

complaints. 

Partial relief was defined as a minimum of 50% 

decrease in the frequency of bedwetting recorded 
preoperatively. 

Fisher’s exact test was used for statistical 
analysis. 

3. Results 
Thirty-four patients had adenoidectomy, 162 
patients had adenotonsillectomy, 77 patients had 
adenoidectomy and myringotomy or ventilation 
tube insertion, 48 patients had adenotonsillectomy 
and myringotomy or ventilation tube insertion. 
The incidence of NE among the children with 
UAO was 34.5% and among the children with 
sleep disturbance in addition to UAO was 33%. 
The difference was not statistically significant. 

Seventy-four of 111 children who had NE pre-
operatively were evaluated 3 months after surgery. 
Of whom 47 (63%) reported complete and three 
(4%) partial relief of NE while 24 children (33%) 
reported no change in their symptoms. 

4. Discussion 
The etiology of primary NE remains somewhat 
controversial but may include genetic factors, decreased 
functional bladder capacity, increased diuresis 
at night, immature arousal mechanism, and 
abnormal ADH secretion. Deep sleep, neurologic 
bladder dysfunction, bacteriuria, diet, and psychogenic 
factors play only a minimal role. 

Wille [13] reported the rate of NE to be 7.3% in 
children aged 7 while Norgaard [2] stated this rate 
as 5–15%. Hjalmas [1] reported this rate to be 
more than 5% in the same age group and 0.5% in 
the adult population. 

NE has been reported in children and occasionally 
in adults with UAO [4–11]. U. 
neri et al. [5] 
detected NE in 16 of 87 children with UAO. 
Guilleminault [4] reported the rate of NE in children 
with OSAS to be 26%. In our study, we 
found the incidence of the NE to be 34.5% in a 
group of patients who underwent surgical intervention 
for UAO. 

Tremendous controversy exists as to how to 
document obstruction caused by the adenotonsillar 
hyperplasia. Clinically, sleep disturbances such 
as loud snoring with snorting, choking or pauses

(apneas), restless sleep, morning headaches, 
lethargy, and growth disturbances may all be 
more or less prominent. Although the diagnostic 
usefulness of multichannel polisomnography 
(PSG) has been well worked out for adults, standartization 
and meaningful parameters to determine 
the effects of apnea and hypopnea 
(frequency and duration) have yet to emerge from 
the pediatric literature [12]. In our study, the 
diagnosis of sleep disturbance with UAO was 
made by detailed history from parents. The incidence 
of NE among the children with UAO was 
34.5%, and among the children with sleep disturbance 
in addition to UAO was 33%. The difference 
was not statistically significant (P0.05). 
This result shows that sleep disturbance has no 
additional effect on pathogenesis of NE. 

Weider [6] reported a cure rate of 76% for NE 
following surgery for UAO in 115 children. U. 
neri 

[5] reported partial or complete response in 10 of 
16 (62%) children. Timms [8] and Karaman [10] 
reported complete cure in all of 10 and 11 children, 
respectively. Nowak [11] reported a case 
that developed NE after cleft palate reconstruction 
and improved after adenoidectomy. Ullfberg 
[14] and Kramer [15] have reported three and five 
adult patients, respectively with NE and OSAS 
who improved following surgery. We found a 
complete cure in 47 of 74 patients (63%) following 
surgery. 
There are several hypotheses to explain the 
relationship between the UAO and the NE. Maddern 
[7] suggested that NE is a result of decreased 
neuromuscular tonus in the course of sleep which 
is more significant in patients with OSAS. Authors 
claimed that, enuretic patients have lacked 
the normal nocturnal increase in antidiuretic hormone 
levels and had nocturnal urine production 
up to four times the volume of functional bladder 
capacity which explains spontaneous bladder 
emptying [2]. Contrary to this, Lackgren et al. [16] 
were unable to find any difference in the diurnal 
antidiuretic hormon secretion between enuretic 
and normal controls. Weider [17] suggested that 
NE is caused by UAO during sleep in which a 
defect in central nervous system adjustment, presumably 
secondary to temporary fall in oxygen 
tension, led to loss of bladder control. In another 

study, the same author indicated that a number of 
patients who could not be aroused before surgery 
were able to wake up and go to the bathroom 
after surgery [6]. 

In our opinion although there is a strong relationship 
NE and UAO, the exact course of this 
phenomenon needs to be detected further. 

5. Conclusions 
It is not our intent to infer that all NE is due to 
UAO. We do suggest that UAO is probably a 
more common etiologic factor in NE than previously 
recognised. When UAO is present, it is a 
factor that usually can be treated successfully, 
producing grateful patients and parents after surgical 
intervention.
