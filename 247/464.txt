Study Objectives: Childhood sleep disorders are consistently shown to 
affect behavior and cognition, but first-night effects on these measures are 
generally unknown. We sought to examine how sleep in the home versus 
the laboratory differed among healthy toddlers and how such differences 
relate to standardized scores on assessments the morning following polysomnography. 
Design, Setting, and Participants: Twenty healthy 14-month-olds wore 
actigraphs during nighttime sleep at home for 5 nights preceding and during 
standard overnight laboratory polysomnography. The Bayley Scales of 
Infant Development (BSID-II) were administered once the morning after 
polysomnography. 
Measurements and Results: All subjects had normal polysomnography. 
Sleep-start times at home and during polysomnography did not differ, 
whereas, during polysomnography, subjects awoke earlier (p = .008, d 
= .58), their total sleep time (p <. 001, d = 1.1) and sleep efficiency (p = 
.004, d = .57) were reduced, and they had shorter sleep-bout lengths (p 
= .004, d = .03), less immobility (p = .003, d = .62), and greater average 

INTRODUCTION 

THE CUMULATIVE EVIDENCE OF DELETERIOUS EFFECTS 
FROM SLEEP-DISORDERED BREATHING (SDB) 
DURING EARLY CHILDHOOD IS SUBSTANTIAL AND compelling. 
Impairments in cognition and school performance associated 
with pediatric SDB have been shown repeatedly.1-6 Furthermore, 
pediatric SDB leads to greater utilization of healthcare 
resources,7 more-frequent dose-dependent cardiovascular morbid-
ity,8 reversible failure to thrive,9 and comorbid chronic illnesses,10 
as well as more psychiatric and behavioral comorbidities.4,5,11-13 
Evidence from animal models14,15 and interventional studies16-19 
suggest that treatment leads to at least partial reversibility of these 
morbidities, highlighting the importance of early detection. 

In addition to SDB, “primary snoring” is increasingly recognized 
as not just innocent noise during sleep but, rather, a condition 
that may lead to reduced daytime functioning.20,21 Compared 
with nonsnoring controls, 5- to 8-year-old children who snore but 
have an obstructive apnea-hypopnea index of less than 1 per hour 
of total sleep time (TST) show impaired verbal and global IQ and

activity during sleep (p <. 001, d = .98). Standardized assessments were 
not affected by differences between home and polysomnography night 
sleep, but children with greater emotional regulation difficulty had a lower 
percentage of immobility (r = -0.67, p = .001) and increased sleep fragmentation 
(r = -0.60, p = .005) during polysomnography. 
Conclusions: Although sleep-onset times were preserved, sleep in the 
laboratory was disrupted, compared with at home. These differences did 
not affect standardized scores, but the magnitude of the difference was 
associated with worse emotional regulation. The effects of sleep disturbance 
during polysomnography, or the influence of poor emotional regulation 
on sleep in the laboratory, should be considered in studies of young 
children.

reduced selective and sustained attention and memory6,22 Furthermore, 
we have recently shown that, among snoring infants with 
no evidence for either apnea or hypopnea during sleep, snore-related 
arousals are related to decreased indexes of mental development.
23 

Despite the rather extensive work assessing cognitive development 
and overall health consequences within the spectrum of pediatric 
SDB, few studies have included an adaptation night in the 
laboratory to compensate for first-night effects. Although SDB is 
apparently not vulnerable to first-night effects,24-27 Suratt and colleagues 
recently found that children ages 6 to 12 years old with 
mild to moderate SDB were able to partially compensate for sleep 
loss due to SDB by sufficiently increasing sleep time in the home 
to avoid impairment to intelligence scores.28 Thus, truncated TST 
due to first-night effects in the laboratory may not affect measures 
of SDB but may alter overall cognitive or developmental scores. 
The purpose of the present study was to objectively compare sleep 
in the home and during 1 night of laboratory polysomnography 
among healthy toddlers and to determine whether the differences 
between sleep in the home versus in the sleep lab affect scores on 
standardized mental and motor scales or behavior. 

METHODS 

Subjects were recruited as part of a larger study through local 
hospitals in which the Institutional Review Boards approved 
the study: Clark Memorial Hospital, Baptist Hospital East, Floyd 
Memorial Hospital, Norton Healthcare, Norton Suburban Hospital, 
and the University of Louisville Hospital. A parent or both 
parents signed informed consent and Health Information Portability 
and Accountability Act authorization for participation in 
the study, as approved by the Institutional Review Board at the

abilities. Vocalizations and the beginnings of verbal communication 
are measured as early evidence of the ability to form generalizations 
and classifications, which are a basis of abstract thinking. 
The PDI measures fine and gross motor skills relating to reaching, 
quality of movement, functional hand skills, and sensory integration. 


The MDI and PDI are each expressed as a standard score ranging 
from 50 to 150 and encompassing 3 standard deviations (15 
points) on either side of the mean (100 points). Higher scores indicate 
better performance. When administered at the same age, 
there is a correlation between the MDI and the Stanford-Binet IQ 
test.34 The MDI at 12 and 18 months is correlated with IQ at 2.5 
and 3 years,36 and, at 24 months, the MDI is correlated with IQ at 
3 and 5 years.37 

The behavior rating scale consists of 30 child behaviors rated by 
the test administrator on a 4-point scale; the behaviors are scored 
as percentiles based on norms for children older than 6 months 
on 3 factors: Orientation/Engagement, Emotional Regulation, and 
Motor Quality. A higher percentile score on each indicates better 
performance. 

Statistical Analyses 

Descriptive statistics were calculated. Repeated-measures 
analysis of variance was used for comparisons between home- 
and polysomnography-night actigraphy measures. The Cohen d 
was calculated to determine effect sizes. z Scores were calculated 
for the differences between home- and polysomnography-night 
actigraphy measures (home-night value minus polysomnographynight 
value). Regression analysis was used to examine the relationship 
between z scores for the differences between home- and 
polysomnography-night actigraphy measures in relation to BSIDII 
measures. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 13.0 (SPSS, 
Inc., Chicago, IL) and, due to the small number of subjects, a p 
value less than .01 was considered significant. 

RESULTS 

Twenty-two subjects were recruited for participation in the 
study and completed the protocol. Data from 2 subjects were 
dropped from analysis because the subjects’ sleep-wake schedules 
in the home were highly irregular; 1 subject had an average 
sleep onset of 01:32 AM 
and rise time of 13:04 PM; the other had 
an average sleep onset time of 12:51 AM 
and rise time of 07:58 AM. 
Data from the remaining 20 subjects were available for analyses.

Twelve of these toddlers wore an actigraph all 5 nights preceding 
the polysomnography night; 8 wore the actigraph only 4 nights 
because the caretaker forgot to put the actigraph on the subject on 
1 night (N=5), put it on after sleep onset (N=2), or the actigraph 
was delivered late (N=1). During the polysomnography night, 4 
participants were administered prophylactic ibuprofen for teething 
and 1 was administered topical hydrocortisone; these medications 
were also administered during the preceding home nights. 
Subject demographics and family information are shown in Table 

1. 
All subjects had normal sleep measures on polysomnography. 
Central apneas accounted entirely for apnea-hypopnea index indexes; 
no subject had any obstructive apneas, hypopneas, or significant 
desaturations (Table 2). 

Individual bedtimes were preserved in the laboratory; sleep 
start on the polysomnography night did not differ significantly 
from the averaged values for home nights. Compared with home 
nights, during the polysomnography night, sleep end was earlier 
and there was less TST, lower sleep efficiency, shorter sleep-bout 
lengths, a lower percentage of immobility time, and higher activity 
scores during sleep (Table 3). 

All MDI and PDI values were within normal. There was a wide 
range of percentile scores on the subscales of the Behavior Rating 
subcales. Two subjects scored in the questionable or nonoptimal 
range of the Orientation/Engagement subscale, and 1 scored in 
the nonoptimal range on the Emotional Regulation subscale. No 
subjects scored within clinical range on the Motor Quality sub-
scale (Table 4). There were no significant correlations between 
actigraphy measures in the home and BSID-II indexes or scales 
the morning following polysomnography. Greater sleep fragmentation 
during the polysomnography night was significantly 
associated with worse percentile score on the Behavior Rating 
Scale Emotional Regulation subscale (r = -.59, p = .006). Lower 
Emotional Regulation subscale scores were also significantly associated 
with greater difference scores for both Immobility percentage 
(r = .665, p = .001) (Figure 2) and Fragmentation Index (r 
= .60, p = .005) (Figure 3), indicating that subjects who had less 
immobility and more fragmentation during their night in the sleep 
lab, compared with at home, had greater difficulty with emotional

disturbance. However, although TST differed at home compared 
with the sleep lab, this measure was not associated with assessment 
scores. This was somewhat surprising considering the evidence 
from experimental and intentional sleep restriction in older 
children. Indeed, mild reductions in the opportunity to sleep in 
school-age children has been associated with substantial difficulties 
in attention and impulsivity control.38,39 Similar findings are 
reported in naturalistic studies in which the overall duration of 
sleep in the home has been linked to aggressive and delinquent 
behavior as well as social and attention problems.12 Of interest, 
when a 2-hour sleep restriction has been imposed on children, the 
most prominent manifestation of sleepiness occurs around 10:00 
am, usually the time at which neurobehavioral testing will take 
place after the sleep study in the laboratory.40 

One concern of the current findings is how to interpret previous 
studies that have used the standard protocol of administering assessments 
the morning following the polysomnography. Based on 
our results, we would not expect a night of disturbed sleep to alter 
standardized testing scores when there are no time limits or pressures 
to perform. However, the data suggest that administration 
of tests that may be affected by emotional regulation the morning 
following polysomnography without an adjustment night should 
be considered a study limitation. Further, it is unknown whether 
a single adjustment night would eliminate the effects of sleep disturbance 
in the laboratory. 

Based on our current findings, the effects of unintended sleep 
disturbance during laboratory-based polysomnography should be 
considered in behavioral studies of young children, particularly 
those using measures vulnerable to impaired emotional regulation. 
These data recommend that behavioral assessments, especially 
those vulnerable to difficulty with emotional regulation, be 
administered at a time when the subject is not likely to have experienced 
sleep disruption.
