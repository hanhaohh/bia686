Study objective: To determine the differences in craniofacial cephalometric variables between 
snoring and nonsnoring children. 
Design: Cross-sectional. 
Setting: Case Western Reserve University Dental School, Department of Orthodontics, and local 
Cleveland orthodontic private practices. 
Patients: Twenty-eight snoring and 28 nonsnoring children between the ages of 7 years and 14 
years. Nonsnoring subjects were matched to snoring subjects by age, sex, and ethnicity (mean 
[. 
SD] age, 10 . 
2 years; 82% white, 64% female). 
Interventions: None. 
Measurements: Snoring was assessed using a sleep behavior questionnaire administered to 
parents or guardians. The cephalometric radiographs of the study subjects were traced by a 
single investigator, and 1 angular measurement and 11 linear measurements of hard and soft 
tissues were recorded. The paired Student’s t test was used to analyze the cephalometric data. 
Results: Snoring children manifest a significantly narrower anterior-posterior dimension of the 
pharynx at the superior and most narrow widths. Snoring children also had a greater length from 
the hyoid to the mandibular plane. 
Conclusions: Snoring children appear to present craniofacial factors that differ from those of 
nonsnoring children. (CHEST 2000; 118:596–603)

hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS), whose medical consequences 
range from no physical debilitation to 
failure to thrive.2,3 It is estimated that as many as 
70% of adults with OSAHS snored during childhood.

hypertension, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular 
disease, and impaired function caused by sleepiness.

Epidemiologic studies of habitual snoring in children

Snoring children are reportedly mouth breathers11,13 
or restless sleepers,9 –11 have excessive daytime sleepiness,
9,10 are hyperactive,9,10 have poorer hearing,11

tonsils.14 Although snoring has been reported 
to be a common finding in children with symptomatic 
OSAHS,14 –18 only a subgroup of habitually 
snoring children have OSAHS.13

Genetic and environmental factors influence snoring, 
and many studies support an anatomic origin.
19,20 Palatal flutter has been reported to be the 
most important cause of snoring.21 In situations of 
airway obstruction, the blockage is often located at 
the level of the soft palate, but has also been identified 
elsewhere within the entire extent of the pharynx.21–23 

Several studies have used cephalometrics to examine 
for anatomic differences in snoring and apneic 
subjects.19,24–28 Most frequently, cephalometric radiographs 
of adults with apnea were compared with 
radiographs of nonapneic adults. The tendency was 
for apneic adults to have an increased hyoid to 
mandibular plane (H–MP) distance, longer soft palates, 
a diminished sagittal cranial base dimension, 
and narrower posterior airways. Few studies have 
investigated differences in cephalometric factors in 
children. A Japanese study29 found that children with 
apnea had an inferiorly positioned hyoid. In the most 
severe apneics, the children presented with enlarged 
adenoids and narrow airways. An Italian study30 
reported that habitually snoring children with apnea 
and adenotonsillar hypertrophy had increased craniomandibular 
intermaxillar, lower and upper gonial 
angles with a retroposition, and posterior rotation of 
the mandible (high-angle face), and a reduction in the 
nasal posterior airway space because of enlarged 
adenoids. Most previous reports have used a sample 
of children suspected of having OSAHS, who were 
referred to either the Sleep Disorders Center or the 
otolaryngology department. However, there have 
been no reported cephalometric studies in children 
with and without habitual snoring conducted in 
settings such as the orthodontic environment in 
which predominately healthy children with dental 
malocclusions are seen at fairly regular intervals. We 
speculate that such a population affords the feasibility 
of studying children when they are healthy, presumably 
before disease development, and as an impetus for 
future investigations. 

The purpose of the present study was to determine 
the differences in craniofacial factors between 
habitual snoring and nonsnoring children from an 
orthodontic population, using measurements made 
from cephalometric radiographs. 

Materials and Methods 

Study Sample 

The study sample was derived by a two-step process: (1) The 
first step included screening for children (ages 7 to 14 years) with 
sleep and behavior problems from a population seeking pretreatment 
orthodontic evaluation at the School of Dentistry, and from 
12 orthodontic private practices in Cleveland, OH. Children who 
had been treated before this initial examination by means of 

either orthodontics or dentofacial orthopedics were excluded 
from the study. This study was approved by the Institutional 
Review Board of the university. The parents or guardians were 
asked to sign a consent form and then complete a demographic 
and sleep behavior questionnaire on behalf of their children. The 
sleep behavior questionnaire was adapted from a previous study9 
and was administered to parents or guardians of the children for 
a 10-month period. The questionnaire consisted of 11 Likert-type 
scale (never, rarely, sometimes, often) and 7 yes/no questions, 
and has been validated and shown to be reliable in assessing the 
sleep problems of the child. For the purposes of this study, only 
the responses to snoring and age at onset of snoring were used. 

(2) The second step included identifying from the screening 
questionnaire those children who snored often, with a volume 
ranging from moderate to very loud. The snoring children 
(experimental group) were then matched to a control group of 
nonsnoring children on the basis of age, sex, and ethnicity. The 
nonsnorers were those children whose parents or guardians had 
indicated on the questionnaire as having never snored. A total of 
31 snoring and 31 nonsnoring children were identified through 
this process. The pretreatment records of each subject were 
reviewed to ensure that the child was healthy and free of serious 
medical problems. Subjects with documented craniofacial anomalies 
such as cleft lip and palate were excluded. Pretreatment 
cephalometric radiographs that are part of initial records were 
examined for diagnostic quality and to ensure that all critical 
landmarks were included within the boundaries of the image (eg, 
hyoid). 
Data Collection 

Demographic Data: The subject’s sex and ethnicity were 
documented from the dental records. The height and weight 
information was obtained from the parents and was recorded for 
each subject in inches and pounds. The body mass index (BMI) 
was then calculated for each subject (weight in kilograms/height 
[meters squared]). 

Cephalometric Data: The nasion rest on the cephalometer 
used to expose the cephalometric radiographs was measured to 
assist in determining the magnification of the radiographic 
images. All linear measurements were adjusted for their respective 
level of magnification. The cephalometric radiographs of the 
subjects were traced and a total of 11 linear and 1 angular 
measurements were recorded by a single investigator (R.K.). 

Figure 1 illustrates the following five conventional hard-tissue 
linear measurements and the mandibular plane: the linear measurement 
from sella turcica to nasion (S–N); the linear measurement 
from basion to nasion; the anterior-posterior length of the 
maxilla measured from A-point to the posterior nasal spine 
(A–PNS); the effective length of the body of the mandible 
measured from gonion to gnathion (Go–Gn); and H–MP (measured 
from the most inferior border of the mandible to menton). 

Figure 2 illustrates six soft-tissue linear measurements and the 
occlusal and B-point to gonion reference planes. The measurements 
include the length of the soft palate; the vertical airway length 
measured from the posterior nasal spine (PNS) to the base of the 
epiglottis (VAL); tongue length (TL) measured from the base of 
the epiglottis to the most anterior point of the tongue that touches 
the lingual surface of the mandibular incisors; the width of the 
pharyngeal airway at the most posterior-superior point on the soft 
palate (S–PAS), measured parallel to the functional occlusal plane 
from the posterior-superior palate to the superior posterior pharyngeal 
wall; the width of the pharyngeal airway at the level of the plane 
from B-point to gonion measured from the inferior posterior 
pharyngeal wall to the most anterior point in the airway on the 
tongue; and the width of the pharyngeal airway at its most narrow

point inferior to the PNS and superior to gonion (N–PAS). It was 
measured from the posterior pharyngeal wall at the narrowest point 
to the most anterior point in the airway on the soft palate, parallel to 
the plane from B-point to gonion. 

Figure 3 demonstrates the measure called middle cranial fossa 
(MCF) alignment, which is taken from the counterpart analysis of 
Enlow et al.31 The alignment of the subject’s MCF is compared 
with a neutral position found at 40.3°. The PM is the boundary 
that separates the anterior cranial fossa and nasomaxillary complex 
from the middle cranial fossa and pharynx. The PM vertical 
(patient’s PM) is a line from the averaged intersections of the 
great wings of the sphenoid and anterior cranial floor, extending 
to the averaged lowermost points of the pterygomaxillary fissure. 
A subject with a vertical PM located anterior to the neutral 
position has a forward alignment of the MCF and a protrusively 
positioned maxilla. The opposite is true for a vertical PM located 
behind the neutral PM. 

Errors in landmark identification were estimated by examining 
duplicate tracings of 12 of the cephalometric radiographs (19%). 
Intraclass correlation coefficients32 were computed to examine 
the reliability of landmark identification. Intraexaminer reliability 
for the 12 cephalometric variables ranged from 0.75 to 0.99. 

Statistical Analysis 

The independent variables measured on a continuous scale 
included 12 anatomic variables derived from cephalometric 

radiographs, age, and BMI. Sex was used as a dichotomous 
variable. Means and SDs were calculated for all continuous 
variables. Paired Student’s t tests were used to test for equality of 
means between snoring and nonsnoring children. A p value 
. 
0.004 using Bonferroni’s correction (. 
of 0.05 divided by the 
total number of variables [0.05/12 . 
0.004]) was used to determine 
statistical significance. All computations were performed 
using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS-PC. 
for Windows; SPSS; Chicago, IL). 

Results 

A total of 228 parents and guardians completed 
the sleep behavior questionnaire. The parents and 
guardians were given the option of selecting from the 
following five choices when asked whether their 
child snored: never, rarely, sometimes, often, and 
unsure. Approximately 16% of the children snored 
often, 20% sometimes, 31% rarely, 32% had never 
snored, and 1% were unsure. Thirty-six children 
snored often. However, from a pool of 74 subjects 
who had never snored, it was only possible to 
accurately match 31 pairs for age, sex, and ethnicity.

Furthermore, we had to eliminate three experimental 
children who had adenotonsillectomy before 
seeking orthodontic care, because of concerns about 
the treatment’s effect on soft-tissue measurements. 
Hence, the three control children who were matched 
to these experimental children were also eliminated 
from the analyses. 

The 56 subjects who constituted the study sample 
were 64% female, 82% white, with a mean age of 
10 .

adenoids were present in all subjects. The BMI was 
significantly (p .

(20.4 . 
4.6) compared with the nonsnoring group 
(17.9 . 
3.4). The average age of onset of snoring was 
34.6 . 
30 months with a range from birth to 9 years.

variables between the snoring and nonsnoring sub


jects are presented in Table 1. The variables presenting 
the most significant difference (p .

the groups included H–MP, N–PAS, and

Go–Gn demonstrated a trend toward significance 
(p . 
0.05) between the snoring and nonsnoring 
groups. 

Discussion 

The present study included subjects between the 
ages of 7 years and 14 years, because that was the age 
range of most children presenting for orthodontic 
treatment. Only 36 of 228 subjects (16%) surveyed 
answered “often” to the snoring question. This percentage 
is slightly higher than the previously reported

snoring prevalence of 7% to 12% in children.9 –12 One 
reason for the above-average percentage of snoring 
children in our study might be attributed to selection 
bias introduced by an orthodontic practice in gathering 
the experimental subjects. This private office 
completed sleep behavior questionnaires on snoring 
subjects only. The total contribution to the study 
from that practice consisted of two experimental 
subjects. Subjects from the dental school clinic and 
the other private practices were recruited randomly 
according to the selection criteria. 

The average age at onset of snoring in the present 
study was somewhat higher than the results of 
Brouillette et al in 1982.16 They examined . 
70 
infants and children with OSAHS and found that the 
mean age at onset of breathing difficulties, including 
snoring, was 14 . 
12 months. Most of the subjects in 
their study were . 
5 years of age. Our study cannot 

be compared directly to the study by Brouillette et 
al16 because of the fact that their sample comprised 
young and apneic children. However, indications are 
that snoring and breathing difficulties can start early 
in children. 

BMI was observed to be significantly greater in 
snoring children than in nonsnoring children in the 
present study. We did not directly measure the 
height and weight of our subjects, but had to depend 
on the recall of this information from the parents. 
Whether the parents recalled this information correctly 
is subject to uncertainty. However, our results 
are contrary to other studies that have reported that 
snoring and apneic children may in fact be underweight 
or underdeveloped.16,33 In another study of 
children, no significant differences in obesity were 
found between primary snoring and apneic children.

the lack of a nonsnoring group for comparison. In 
addition, there are conflicting reports from the adult 
literature, inasmuch as some studies have found 
BMI to be significantly increased in snoring and 
apneic populations,24 –26,28 whereas others have 
found BMI to be of no significance in adults.27,34 

We chose 12 cephalometric variables based on 
their importance as reported in the literature35 and 
our previous studies.36,37 In comparing the means of 
these 12 cephalometric measurements, three variables 
demonstrated statistical significance. H–MP 
distance was significantly longer in snoring children. 
The normative values for H–MP distance for normal 
healthy children (ages 10 to 17 years) with no sleep 
problems ranged between 14.8 mm and 15.9 mm.38 
Although our sample of children were younger, the 
snorers had a larger vertical distance (17 mm) than 
the normal values. Apneic children have also been 
found to have an increased H–MP distance.29 In 
studies of apneic adults, the H–MP distance was 
consistently associated with OSAHS.35 In a recent 
study,39 the relationship between oropharyngeal airway 
(OPA) and hyoid position has been described as 
when the mandibular body lengthens, the attachments 
of the genioglossus and geniohyoid muscles 
move forward away from the oropharynx, thus increasing 
the OPA. Also, this study strongly supports 
an association between a short mandible and small 
OPA in the context of OSAHS. Also, in our present 
study, we found the snoring children to have a strong 
tendency toward a smaller mandibular length compared 
with that of nonsnorers. Whether children 
with only primary snoring and no apnea, but with 
smaller mandibular length and inferiorly positioned 
hyoid, eventually develop OSAHS in later years is an 
area worth investigating with longitudinal studies. 

Two of the three measures of pharyngeal width 
(S–PAS and N–PAS) also showed statistical signifi


cance in the present study. Previous studies have also 
found significant reduction in posterior airway space 
in apneic children, and attributed the narrowing of 
the airway to tonsil and adenoid hypertrophy, and 
anatomic abnormalities.16,29,39 In the present study, a 
greater proportion of the parents of snoring subjects 
were told by the physician that the children had 
enlarged adenoids (38% vs 7%) and tonsillar hypertrophy 
(32% vs 13%). This may in part have contributed 
to the pharyngeal narrowing in the snoring 
children. However, caution has to be exercised with 
the reporting of the adenotonsillar hypertrophy, as a 
clinician did not conduct intraoral examinations on 
these children at the time of this study. Furthermore, 
we could not analyze the results separately for 
those with and without adenotonsillar hypertrophy 
because our sample sizes were small; therefore, 
stratification would have meant less precise results. 

The present study found an increase in the VAL, 
and a shortened maxilla (A–PNS) and cranial base 
(S–N) in snoring subjects. Pae et al40 suggest that an 
extended airway results in narrowing and turbulent 
airflow. Others have observed neck extension to act 
favorably on nasorespiratory function.41,42 The fact 
that snorers had a shortened maxilla (A–PNS) and 
cranial base (S–N) may suggest a narrowing in the 
sagittal dimension. In a recent study of habitually 
snoring and apneic children, the authors suggest that 
retroposition of the mandible was not essential to the 
development of upper-airway obstruction, but rather 
contributed by posterior crossbites caused by a 
reduced growth of the maxilla after continuous oral 
breathing, and anterior open-bite with lip incompetence, 
owing to a forward tongue position.30 Studies 
in adults have also demonstrated a significant reduction 
in the sagittal dimension of the anterior cranial 
base in apneics,19 a reduction in cranial base and 
mandible in snorers, and a shorter maxilla in apne-

ics.25 These studies suggest that habitual snorers 
might have an anatomic predisposition to airway 
obstruction. 

A limitation of the present study is that we did not 
evaluate the children with polysomnography to determine 
the degree of respiratory disturbances during 
sleep. Therefore, some of the snoring children 
may have had apneas. But according to a previous 
study, only a subgroup of habitually snoring children 
have apneas.13 We speculate that many of our children 
may have been just primary snorers, especially 
because the children were healthy and were not 
referred to us because of suspected OSAHS. Although 
this cross-sectional study is limited in helping 
us understand whether anatomic variation exists 
from childhood, our data suggest that there are 
craniofacial factors that may be different between 
snoring and nonsnoring children. Approximately 
90% of the growth of the craniofacial skeleton is 
obtained by the age of 12 years, and 60% by the age 
of 4 years.43 Inasmuch as the average age of the 
present study population was 10 years, we can 
assume that facial growth and development might 
have already been modified, especially in the presence 
of airway obstruction early in life. Therefore, 
future studies should consider studying children before 
the age of 4 years to understand whether craniofacial 
factors precede the development of OSAHS. 

Other methodologic limitations of the study include 
the following: 

1. Sample size 
was limited by the number of 
experimental subjects that met the criteria of 
the study. As with most studies, a larger 
sample may have demonstrated greater precision 
of the results. Also, selection bias could 
have affected the study results, inasmuch as 
only subjects seeking orthodontic treatment 
were included. Our subjects were undergoing 
orthodontic treatment for the correction of 
dental anomalies. We excluded children with 
craniofacial anomalies, and therefore craniofacial 
factors that do differ between our sample 
and children who do not seek orthodontic 
treatment are probably minimal. However, it 
is also more prevalent for middle and higher 
socioeconomic groups to seek orthodontic 
treatment than the lower-income groups. 
Therefore, generalization to a larger population 
is still limited. 
2. The cephalometric radiographs used in the 
study came from multiple sources. The radiographs 
were all exposed on cephalometers 
incorporating ear rods and nasion rests to 
approximate the Frankfort horizontal plane 
parallel to the floor. Although radiographic 
quality could be controlled, head position was 
not controlled for during exposure. A prior 
study44 had noted that a change from natural 
head position to a 20° extension resulted in a 
change in hyoid position and increased cross-
sectional dimension of the retroglossal pharynx. 
Future studies should control for the 
head position. 

3. Owing to uncontrolled upper-airway muscle 
activities, the measurements of posterior airway 
space may not always be reliable. Many of 
the soft-tissue points used in this study are 
subject to variation in landmark identification, 
but repeat measurements indicated that the 
reproducibility of these variables were good. 
4. The 
use of cephalometric radiographs provides 
only a static two-dimensional image in 
the sagittal plane. Inferences to three-dimensional 
anatomic structures cannot be made 
based solely on the cephalometric image. Additionally 
there could be differences between 
upright and supine radiographs. Findings by 
our group36 indicated that upright evaluation 
provided the same information as supine, and 
that group differences in airway morphology 
can be detected using standard cephalometric 
radiography in the upright position. 
Conclusion 

The value of the cephalometric radiograph in the 
study of the head and neck and associated pathologies 
is unsurpassed. It is widely accessible and 
relatively inexpensive in comparison to alternative 
imaging procedures. Information obtained from 
cephalometric assessment has been invaluable in a 
great number of studies in airway pathology, including 
snoring and sleep apnea. 

Our data indicate that there are craniofacial differences 
between snoring and nonsnoring children. 
Longitudinal studies of habitually snoring children 
without apnea could demonstrate whether craniofacial 
modification is an effect of airway obstruction or 
genetically determined, and whether these children 
do eventually develop OSAHS in the ensuing years.
