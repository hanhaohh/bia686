HE OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP apnea syndrome (OSAS) affects 
2% of children.1 The pathogenesis of childhood 
OSAS is multifactorial. Contributing factors include 
anatomic narrowing (as a result of both soft tissue 
and craniofacial structure) and abnormal upper airway 
neuromotor control.2 In most children with OSAS, the 
primary factor that leads to the upper airway obstruction 
is adenotonsillar hypertrophy, and OSAS can be treated 
effectively with tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy.3 
However, in a small number of children in whom additional 
anatomic factors (including obesity) or abnormal 
upper airway neuromotor tone is the predominant cause 
for OSAS, OSAS persists postoperatively.4 In these children, 
continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is 
usually used as the second line of treatment.5 

Although home CPAP use has been reported in 300 
children of all ages,5–7 it is not yet approved by the Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in children who 
weigh 30 kg. Furthermore, few studies have evaluated 
the effectiveness of positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy 
in children, and no prospective studies have evaluated 
objective measures of adherence in the pediatric age 
group. We therefore conducted a multicenter, prospective 
study of PAP therapy in children with OSAS. The 
objectives of this study were to assess objectively adherence 
to and effectiveness of PAP in children. In addition, 
we sought in a randomized, double-blinded manner to 
compare the adherence to and effectiveness of CPAP 
versus bilevel pressure (BPAP) in children with OSAS. 
We hypothesized that effectiveness would be similar but 
adherence would be improved with BPAP compared 
with CPAP, as a result of the lower airway pressure 
during exhalation, resulting in increased patient comfort. 
This study was previously reported in abstract 
form.8 

METHODS 


The study was a prospective, multicenter study performed 
at 3 pediatric sleep centers (Johns Hopkins Hospital, 
Children’s Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota and 
Childrens Hospital Los Angeles). Children who had 
OSAS and whose surgical treatment failed or who were 
not considered surgical candidates (because of either 
minimal adenotonsillar tissue or surgical contraindications) 
were eligible for entry. Patients were randomly 
assigned in a double-blind manner to either CPAP or 
BPAP. They underwent a baseline polysomnogram, followed 
by a PAP titration polysomnogram. A repeat polysomnogram 
was performed on PAP after 6 months of 
therapy. Adherence was assessed with a computerized 
usage meter. Changes in weight, height, BMI, and blood 
pressure (BP) were assessed. In addition, subjective assessments 
were obtained from the parents. 

Written informed consent was obtained from the patients’ 
parent/legal guardian. In addition, assent was 
obtained from children who were older than 5 years. 

The study was approved by the Institutional Review 
Board at each of the participating institutions and was 
conducted under an Institutional Review Board–approved 
investigational device exemption. 

Study 
Group 


Patients who were aged 2 to 16 years, had newly diagnosed 
OSAS, and were candidates for PAP were eligible 
for the study. Children who were younger than 2 years 
and those with Down syndrome were excluded from the 
study because the standard of care at 1 of the participating 
centers was to provide formal behavioral therapy for 
these patients to enhance adherence.9 Patients with 
pathologic central apnea or chronic respiratory failure 
were excluded because they would require BPAP. Patients 
who had received previous PAP treatment were 
excluded. All patients received standard medical care 
from a pediatric, board-certified sleep specialist, including 
therapy for treatable risk factors for OSAS, before 
study enrollment. 

OSAS was diagnosed according to pediatric standards.
10 Patients had to meet at least 1 of the following 
criteria: (1) obstructive apnea hypopnea index (AHI) 
5/hour (hypopnea defined as a 50% decrease in 
airflow of any duration associated with 4% desaturation 
and/or arousal; obstructive apneas scored if 2 respiratory 
cycles in duration); (2) arterial oxygen saturation 
(SaO2) nadir 85%, (3) peak end-tidal PCO2 55 mm 
Hg, or (4) SaO2 92% for 10% of total sleep time (TST) 
and end-tidal PCO2 50 mm Hg for 10% TST. In addition, 
patients had to have at least 1 of the following 
symptoms or signs: (1) snoring and difficulty breathing 
during sleep, (2) failure to thrive (weight 5th percentile 
for age), (3) pulmonary hypertension, (4) excessive 
daytime sleepiness (school-aged children), or (5) symptoms 
of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or other 
behavioral problems (school-aged children). 

Baseline 
Assessment 


Patients underwent baseline polysomnography (PSG) as 
part of their clinical assessment, according to standard 
pediatric recommendations.10–12 Height, weight, and 
awake BP were measured. Care was taken to follow 
pediatric guidelines and use appropriately sized BP cuffs 
when measuring the BP.13 A standardized questionnaire 
regarding symptoms was administered to the caregivers. 

Subjective 
Assessment 


During a standardized interview, parents were asked to 
assess subjectively their child’s degree of sleepiness, temperament, 
and school performance. Some questions had 
a yes/no response, and others rated frequency of events 
(eg, never, once a week, 2–3 times a week, 3 times a 
week). Questions regarding sleepiness included the general 
question of whether the child was sleepy, as well as 
more specific questions to assess the frequency of the

child’s falling asleep while watching television, at school 
(for children older than kindergarten level), and when 
active. The frequency of snoring, labored breathing at 
night, and enuresis (for children 6 years of age) was 
assessed. Yes/no questions included questions as to 
whether the child was irritable, was hyperactive, had 
age-appropriate behavior, and had delayed development. 
For school-aged children, parents were asked to 
rate the child’s school performance as “above average 
(mainly A’s and B’s),” “average (mainly C’s),” or “below 
average (mainly D’s and F’s).” 

Institution 
of 
PAP 
Therapy 


Children were given a mask and headgear without the 
PAP unit to practice wearing for 2 weeks while awake to 
help them habituate to the system. Each family also 
received a standardized behavioral instruction sheet.9 
After 2 weeks, the patient underwent an overnight laboratory 
titration study to determine the optimal pressure 
required. A standardized protocol that was based on 
previous clinical pediatric experience was used. The goal 
of the titration polysomnogram was to eliminate all obstructive 
apneas, desaturation, and hypercapnia at a 
level of pressure tolerated by the patient without excessive 
awakenings. The minimal CPAP/expiratory pressure 
(EPAP) that was provided by the study equipment was 3 
cm H2O. For patients who were randomly assigned to 
CPAP, PAP was started at 3 cm H2O and was increased to 
4cmH2O and then increased further in 2-cm H2O 
increments as needed. For patients who were randomly 
assigned to BPAP, the aim was to keep a 6-cm H2O 
difference between inspiratory and expiratory pressures. 
The patient was started on 4/3 (minimum) cm H2O; 
pressure then was increased by 2-cm H2O increments to 
6/3, 8/3, 10/4, 12/6, 14/8, 16/10 cm H2O, etc. Supplemental 
oxygen was added when the patient desaturated 
persistently to 92% in the absence of apnea, paradoxical 
breathing, or snoring. 

After the titration study, the patient was provided 
with a VPAP II ST-A (ResMed, San Diego, CA) PAP 
machine, mask, headgear, and humidifier, free of 
charge, and the family was instructed on its use. This 
machine can provide either CPAP or BPAP. The patient, 
the patient’s family, and all study physicians and coordinators 
were blinded as to the mode of therapy. Because 
patients and their families were nai¨ve to the use of 
PAP and had not experienced either CPAP or BPAP 
treatment in the past, it was not anticipated that they 
would guess which modality they were receiving. By 
necessity, the sleep technician was unblinded; however, 
the technician followed a strict protocol. Randomization 
was performed using a randomization table generated by 
the study sponsor, and numbered slips in envelopes 
were provided for each patient. The sleep technician set 
the equipment to the randomized mode during the titration 
polysomnogram. For preservation of blinding, 

the machine control panel and display were covered. 
Because few pediatric masks are available in the United 
States, a variety of masks were used to provide the best 
fit. For maximization of comfort and, hence, adherence, 
all patients were provided with a heated humidifier, and 
a 20-minute pressure ramp was used at sleep onset and 
after awakenings. After the sleep study, patients took the 
equipment home and were instructed to use it during all 
hours of sleep. 

Follow-up 


Patients received a follow-up telephone call after 48 
hours and again after 1 week of PAP use. They then were 
seen in clinic every other month and received a telephone 
call on alternate months when they were not 
being seen. During clinic visits, the patient was assessed 
clinically; a standardized questionnaire regarding symptoms 
of OSAS, as well as side effects of positive pressure 
use, was administered; weight, height, and BP were 
measured; the equipment was inspected; and the usage 
meter was downloaded. During telephone calls, a standardized 
verbal questionnaire was administered regarding 
subjective symptoms as well as potential PAP problems 
and side effects. Side effects were assessed and 
treated at the discretion of the sleep specialist as per 
standard clinical practice (eg, prescribing nasal steroids 
for nasal congestion). After 6 months, a repeat polysomnogram 
was performed on current PAP settings; and 
height, weight, BP, and subjective complaints were reevaluated. 


Patients who did not return for follow-up received 
telephone calls followed by letters. Patients who did not 
return their equipment also received registered letters. 

Assessment 
of 
Adherence 


Objective adherence was obtained by downloading the 
equipment at each clinic visit. Poor adherence was defined 
arbitrarily as use of PAP for an average of 3 
hours/night. Patients with poor adherence received appropriate 
counseling and troubleshooting as per standard 
clinical practice. The protocol called for patients 
who were nonadherent at the 3-month evaluation to be 
switched to the alternative mode of therapy, with a 
repeat titration sleep study to ensure adequate ventilation. 
In practice, only 1 patient was switched to the other 
arm of the study, because most nonadherent patients 
were also not adherent with repeat visits. Patients who 
were lost to follow-up were assumed to be nonadherent. 

Statistical 
Analysis 


The primary objectives in this study were to determine 
adherence to and effectiveness of PAP, both CPAP and 
BPAP, in children with OSAS. The main outcome measurements 
were mean nightly hours of use and AHI. For 
continuous variables, such as age, values are given as

For categorical variables, such as gender, the proportion 
of patients in each category is presented. Differences 
between the 2 modes (BPAP vs CPAP) for demographics 
(gender, race, and age) and baseline characteristics 
(height, weight, BP, and reason for OSA) were compared 
using the independent t 
test or 2 test where 
appropriate. These same types of analyses were done to 
determine differences in the adherent versus nonadherent 
groups. Differences between initial visit and end visit 
(5 month or 6 month) for outcome variables were assessed 
using paired t 
tests, 2 test, or Pearson correlation 
coefficients. Statistical significance required P 
. 
.05. 

During the interim analyses, comparisons between 
modes were performed by 2-way analysis of variance 
with daily and monthly usage as a within-subjects factor 
and with mode as a between-subjects factor. There did 
not seem to be any differences between the BPAP and 
CPAP modes, so future analyses used combined data 
(CPAP . 
BPAP). 

Data that were collected in this study were documented 
on case report forms. A Code of Federal Regulations 
Part 11 compliant database system was created 
using Microsoft Access 97 software (Redmond, WA) for 
computer entry and verification of the data collected on 
the case report forms. All computations of results were

RESULTS

Group 


Thirty children were enrolled. One patient who was 
randomly assigned to BPAP was excluded later because 
it was unclear whether his equipment was used or not, 
because there was a technical problem with the usage 
meter as a result of electricity surges in the home. Thus, 
the results from 29 patients are included in this article. 
Sixteen patient were randomly assigned to BPAP, and 13 
were assigned to CPAP. Seven children weighed 30 kg, 
the FDA cutoff for PAP use. Study group details are 
shown in Table 1. OSAS was attributed to obesity in two 
thirds of the patients; 11 children weighed 100 kg 
(range: 12–171 kg). 

For the CPAP group, the mean pressure used was 8 . 
3cmH2O (range: 4–12). For the BPAP group, the mean 
inspiratory pressure was 11 . 
4cmH2O (range: 4–16), 
and the mean EPAP was 5 . 
3cmH2O (range: 3–10). 

Patient follow-up is shown in Fig 1. Nineteen patients

therefore, 6-month data were unavailable. Two patients 
had 6-month downloads but no PSG, and 1 had 
6-month PSG but no download. There were no significant 
differences in baseline polysomnographic parameters 
between patients who completed the study and 
those who dropped out. 

Adherence 


Patients were classified as nonadherent when mean use 
was 3 hours/night, despite counseling and troubleshooting. 
In addition, patients who did not return for 
follow-up visits (despite frequent telephone calls and 
reminder letters) were classified as nonadherent; it was 
assumed that these patients were not using the equipment. 
Of the 8 patients who did not have 6-month 
downloads, 2 had 0 follow-up after initially receiving 
their equipment, despite concerted efforts to contact 
them. Of the remaining 6 patients, 4 used their machine 
for a mean of 1 hour/night in the month before dropping 
out, and 1 patient used it for 0, 2, and 5 hours, 
respectively, for the 3 months before he dropped out. 
Thus, it seems as though all of these dropouts were 
nonadherent. The last child was an exception, using the 
equipment for 4 to 7 hours/night for 5 months. After 
month 5, the child was placed out of the family and 
could not be located for follow-up. For the purpose of 
analysis, this patient was classified as nonadherent. 

Mean nightly use is shown in Fig 2. Figure 2A shows 
the group mean hour use per month for all patients for 
whom hour meter readings were obtained; Fig 2B shows 
the hour use for all patients, assuming 0 hours for those 
for whom a download could not be obtained. At month 
6, the mean nightly use for patients for whom downloads 
could be obtained was 5.3 . 
2.5 hours. The mean 
nightly use for all 29 patients, assuming that those who 
did not return to have their equipment downloaded 
were using the machines for 0 hours/night, was 3.8 . 


3.3 hours. Interindividual use was variable, with 3 children 
using their equipment for 9 to 10 hours/night. 
Among those who used the equipment for 3 hours a 
night, PAP use increased from month 1 to month 6 (P 
. 
.008). 
There was no difference in use between patients who 
were using CPAP and BPAP (Fig 2), although the study 
was not powered to detect a difference between the 2 

groups. It was assumed that a difference of 1 hour of use 
per night between the 2 treatment groups would be 
clinically significant. On the basis of an acceptable difference 
of 1 hour and an SD of 2.45 (the pooled SD), a 
sample size of 63 patients per group would have been 
required to provide a power of 80% at the 95% confidence 
level; this sample size was not practical for the 
current study. 

There was no significant difference in age, gender, 
race, severity of OSAS (based on AHI, arousal index, and 
SaO2 nadir), subjective symptoms (eg, sleepiness, enuresis, 
hyperactivity, irritability, school performance), mode 
of PAP, pressure level, or indication for PAP (obesity vs 
all other indications) between those who were nonadherent 
and those who were adherent. 

Subjectively, parents were asked to estimate how 
many hours per night their child used the PAP. At the 
5-month telephone call, 18 parents gave an estimated 
duration of use and had their equipment downloaded. 
Parents stated that their child used the PAP a mean of 7.6 

. 
2.6 hours/night, whereas actual adherence, as determined 
by the usage meter, was 5.8 . 
2.4 hours (P 
. 
.001). However, 78% of parents admitted that their child 
did not use the machine every night. It was frequently 
volunteered that the machine was not used during 
weekends or vacations. 
Effectiveness 


PSG on PAP after 6 months of treatment was compared 
with baseline PSG for the 20 patients who returned for 
6-month PSG. Of those who did not return for 6-month 
PSG, 2 were totally lost to follow-up, with no downloads 
available; 3 were adherent with their equipment before 
dropout; and 4 were nonadherent. 

Polysomnographic parameters at baseline (while 
breathing spontaneously) and after 6 months (while on 
PAP) are shown in Table 2 for the 20 patients who 
returned for the 6-month study. Because there were no 
differences in any parameter between CPAP and BPAP, 
combined data are shown. There was no significant 
change in sleep architecture (sleep efficiency and sleep 
stage distribution) on treatment. However, major improvements 
were shown in respiratory parameters, with 
highly significant improvements in both the AHI (P 
. 
.003; Fig 3) and the SaO2 nadir (P 
. 
.001). At baseline,

ities include reduced TST during PSG for the first patient 
(216 minutes at baseline and 311 minutes at 6 months), 
which may have resulted in an inaccurate representation 
of the true AHI, and weight gain in the second 
patient (from 106 kg to 112 kg). 

Growth 


At baseline, most patients were of normal height (Table 
1) but were overweight. The patients as a whole had a 
mean BMI z 
score of 2.1 . 
1.1. No patient had a weight 
or BMI z 
score 1. Two patients had a height z 
score 

2, but both were obese, and the short stature was 
most likely related to their underlying disease (achondroplasia; 
renal transplant) rather than their OSAS. Six-
month growth data were available for 20 patients. 
Growth parameters did not change significantly after 6 
months of PAP. Only 1 obese patient lost weight (a 
1.6-kg reduction from a baseline weight of 159 kg). 
BP 


Baseline BP data were available for 28 patients. At baseline, 
36% of patients had a systolic BP 95th percentile 
for age, gender, and height; and 43% had a systolic BP 

90th percentile. Seven percent had a diastolic BP 
95th percentile, and 11% had a diastolic BP 90th 
percentile. Some but not all of these patient were obese, 
and 1 patient with systolic hypertension had a renal 
transplant and a longstanding history of hypertension on 
treatment. Six-month follow-up BP values were available 
for 18 patients. There was no significant difference 
in any of the BP parameters at 6 months. 
Subjective 
Outcomes 


After 6 months, there was a significant improvement in 
subjective parental assessment of sleepiness. This included 
an improvement in the number of children who 
were reported to be sleepy (P 
. 
.03), falling asleep while 

watching television (P 
. 
.004), and falling asleep at 
school (P 
. 
.007). Of note, at study entry, 58% of 
school-aged children were reported to fall asleep at 
school at least once a week, compared with only 6% 
after 6 months of PAP. However, there was no significant 
subjective improvement in age-appropriate behavior, 
delayed development, irritability, hyperactivity, enuresis, 
or reported school performance. 

At baseline, 100% of parents reported that their children 
snored most nights (3 nights a week). After 6 
months of PAP, there was a significant improvement in 
reported snoring on PAP (P 
. 
.0001): 11% reported 
snoring most nights, 26% reported snoring some nights 
(3 nights a week), and 63% reported no snoring. Similarly, 
there was an improvement in those who were 
reported to have difficulty breathing during sleep. At 
baseline, 62% of patients were reported to have frequent 
difficulty breathing during sleep, 34% had occasional 
difficulty breathing, and 3% were not observed to have 
difficulty breathing; at 6 months, the corresponding values 
were 5%, 16%, and 79% (P 
. 
.0001). 

Side 
Effects 
and 
Technical 
Problems 


Side effects and equipment problems were assessed by 
telephone interview soon after PAP was initiated (ie, at 
48 hours) and after long-term use (5 months). After 48 
hours of use, 14% of families complained of problems 
with the equipment (eg, equipment kept shutting off; 
confusion regarding setup) and 21% complained of 
problems with the mask (eg, “bubble” buckling, mask 
leaks). After 5 months, 10% of families complained of 
equipment problems (eg, tubing worn out) and 10% 
complained of occasional mask problems, primarily 
leaks. One of these families stated that the child had 
“pink eye,” which may have been secondary to the mask 
leak. 

Despite the use of heated humidification, nasal symptoms 
were common, occurring in 17% of patients at 48 
hours and 38% of patients at 5 months. Nasal symptoms 
included congestion, rhinorrhea, and 2 cases of recurrent 
epistaxis. Of note, nasal symptoms at 5 months 
were significantly more common in those who were 
using CPAP than in those who were using BPAP (P 
. 
.02), although there was no difference between the 2 
groups at 48 hours (P 
. 
.31). 

Other side effects were rare. At 48 hours, 3% of 
families noted skin erythema related to the mask; and at 
5 months, 10% noted erythema. However, in all cases, 
the erythema was only occasional and was transient in 
nature. One patient complained of acne in the mask 
distribution and 1 of irritation beneath the nose.

dren, and no other prospective studies have evaluated 
objectively adherence in children. 

Adherence 


The most important finding in this study was the relatively 
poor adherence. First, 8 patients dropped out of 
the study without providing final downloads. Two 
dropped out immediately, and no follow-up was obtained; 
it is unlikely that these patients used the equipment. 
Of the remaining dropouts, all but 1 had very low 
nightly use of their equipment before dropping out. The 
remaining child was placed out of the home and lost to 
follow-up. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that all but 1 
of the dropouts stopped using their equipment. This is 
despite the fact that all patients received intensive support 
at a level greater than typically provided in the 
clinical situation. This support included the use of free 
equipment, including a ramp option and heated humidification, 
and frequent telephonic and clinic follow-up, 
where problems and side effects were addressed by pediatric 
sleep specialists. Second, those who continued to 
use the equipment used it only for a mean of 5.3 hours/ 
night. Although this is very similar to adherence rates in 
adults,18–21 children sleep longer than adults and thus 
would require longer PAP use. For the age range of 2 to 
16 years, children sleep an average of 8 hours/night.22 

In this study, we arbitrarily chose a cutoff of 3 hours 
of use a night to define adherence to evaluate the potential 
predictors of adherence. Clearly, 3 hours of use is 
suboptimal. However, as no previous studies have documented 
objective PAP use in children, we chose a low 
number that would clearly separate those who were 
using the equipment little if at all from those who were 
using it more consistently. There were no trends suggesting 
that a different cutoff point would yield different 
results. 

Previous studies in children have reported relatively 


good rates of subjective adherence on the basis of parental 
report.5,15 However, in this study, there was a marked 
discrepancy between parents’ report of PAP use and 
objective adherence. Thus, it is important to monitor 
adherence objectively. 

We found no difference in adherence or effectiveness 
between the two modes of pressure delivery. It should 
be noted that this study was not powered to detect a 
statistically significant difference. Nevertheless, there 
was no indication of a trend toward a difference in any 
of the parameters, although the mean CPAP pressures (8 
cm H2O) were higher than the mean EPAP pressures (5 
cm H2O). In adults, adherence has been shown to be 
similar between CPAP and BPAP use.21 Nasal side effects 
after chronic use were more common in those who were 
using CPAP than BPAP. Future, larger studies to evaluate 
the difference in adherence between the 2 modes are 
required. 

Two thirds of the patients in this study required PAP 
because of obesity. The prevalence of obesity is increasing 
rapidly in children and adolescents and is currently 
15%.23 Whereas in previous years OSAS in most children 
was related to adenotonsillar hypertrophy, it is now 
frequently related to obesity.24 A significant number of 
children were extremely obese. Although not evaluated 
in this study, it is possible that these children had low 
self-esteem and other psychosocial issues related to their 
obesity that had an impact on their adherence with 
PAP.25 

Effectiveness 


Both CPAP and BPAP were highly effective at treating 
OSAS, as documented by the polysomnographic results. 
This is in agreement with several other studies that were 
performed in infants16,17 and older children.7,26,27 

No changes were seen in growth. This is in contrast to 
a large number of studies that demonstrated increased

weight and height after treatment of OSAS by tonsillectomy 
and adenoidectomy.28–30 The difference between 
the current studies and the surgical studies is probably 
related to differences in the population. Most patients in 
our study had OSAS related to obesity rather than adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy, and the only 2 short patients 
(height z 
score 2 SD) had underlying diseases (achondroplasia, 
renal transplant) in which height would not 
be expected to improve. Unlike a previous report that 
evaluated the response to surgical treatment of OSAS,31 
the current study did not find an increase in obesity after 
PAP treatment. 

A surprisingly large proportion of patients had systolic 
hypertension before institution of PAP. BP did not improve 
during this study. It is likely that the hypertension 
was attributable to obesity rather than OSAS, especially 
because diastolic hypertension may be more common 
than systolic hypertension in children with OSAS.32 

Subjectively, parents noted an improvement in snoring 
and nocturnal breathing and an improvement in all 
parameters of daytime sleepiness, although they did not 
note any changes in temperament, hyperactivity, or 
school performance. Side effects were minor, although 
nasal symptoms were frequent. 

Midfacial hypoplasia has been reported as a side effect 
of PAP in children, although it is probably rare.33,34 We 
did not see any instances of this in the current study, but 
this may have been because infants were excluded from 
the study and because the study duration (6 months) 
may have been too short for this development to occur. 

Limitations 


The main limitation of this study was the high dropout 
rate. However, we posit that the dropouts, with the 
exception of 1 child who was placed out of the home, 
actually reflect nonadherence and thus are part of the 
outcome data for this study. 

This study did not include an untreated control group. 
Theoretically, therefore, the study results (especially the 
subjective results) may have been attributable to a placebo 
effect. However, we consider it unlikely that all of 
the observed changes were attributable to a placebo 
effect because of the highly significant improvement in 
objective measurements such as the polysomnographic 
parameters. Previous studies that evaluated the effects of 
placebo (sham CPAP) in adults showed that placebo may 
cause a slight improvement in subjective measures such 
as quality-of-life parameters35 but does not result in an 
improvement in measures of sleep-disordered breath


ing.35,36 

CONCLUSION 


We have shown that PAP treatment is effective in children 
with OSAS. However, adherence is an important 
issue. We found a high dropout rate and a suboptimal 
nightly usage in those who did not drop out. This is in 

contrast to previous pediatric studies that did not use 
objective adherence monitoring and contradicts parental 
reports regarding PAP use. We recommend that objective 
adherence monitoring be performed in all children 
who require PAP. Additional research is needed to develop 
methods to improve adherence in children who 
require PAP and to develop other treatment alternatives 
for children who do not respond to tonsillectomy and 
adenoidectomy and are unable to tolerate CPAP.
