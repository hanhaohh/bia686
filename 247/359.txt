KEYWORDS Summary 
Sleep-disordered 
breathing; 
Apnea; 
Adenotonsillar 
Objective: Sleep apnea is one of the most deleterious disorders in children with 
adenotonsillar hypertrophy because it can induce hypoxemia of brain. Sleep apnea 
may lead to failure to thrive or to physical and mental delay in development, including 
hypertrophy; 
Minimal brain 
cognitive disturbances. 
The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of adenotonsillar hypertrophy, 
dysfunction; 
Behavior disturbances; 
causing obstructive sleep apnea on neurocognitive abnormalities. 
We were interested in sensorimotor coordination, perception, memory, learning 
Neurocognitive deficits ability, concentration, focused attention and language reception. 
Materials and methods: We examined 221 children. One-hundred and seventeen 
children had sleep apnea caused by adenotonsillar hypertrophy: 87 children aged 6—9 
years and 34 children aged 10—13 years. The control group, without adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy, consisted of 104 healthy children. Both groups of children with and 
without apnea were examined psychologically to determine abilities and minor 
neurocognitive deficit. The token test (TT), diagnosis test of brain dysfunction 
(DCS-test), Luria auditory verbal learning test (LAVLT) and Rey complex figure test 
(RCFT) were applied to both groups. The tests: TT, DCS-test, RCFT were used to 
investigate the level of sensorimotor integration and perception processes. Memory 
and learning abilities were measured using LAVLT. The TT assessed language dysfunction 
in children.

Results: This study shows that adenotonsillar hypertrophy in children aged 6—9 years 
is associated with neurocognitive abnormalities such as: memory problems, concentration 
of attention deficits, learning disability, language dysfunction, lower sensorimotor 
integration and perception. 

The older children (aged 10—13 years) with adenotonsillar hypertrophy had 
memory problems and learning disabilities. They are likely to be caused by of 
concentration of attention deficits. The older children were found to have more 
severe language dysfunction. 
Conclusions: Our study shows that sleep apnea may lead to neurocognitive deficits. 
The results may be helpful in the process of making decision for or against surgery in 
doubtful cases. 

It is important to know the problems connected with apnea in order to recognize 
them and help the child develop by providing adequate treatment and cognitive 
stimulation.

1. Introduction 
Sleep-related breathing disorders range in disease 
severityfromprimaryor simplesnoring(snoringwithout 
blood gas abnormalities) through upper airway 
resistance syndrome (UARS-snoring, increased work 
of breathing and nocturnal arousals with a normal 
blood gas profile) and at the severe end of the 
spectrum, obstructive sleepapnea syndrome(OSAS). 

Obstructive sleep apnea (cessation of air movement 
past the pharynx in conjunction with continued 
chest and diaphragmatic activity that last 
longer than two (1/2) breaths each) is one of the 
most deleterious disorders in children with adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy because it can induce hypoxemia 
of brain [1]. The other major symptoms of 
obstructive sleep apnea are: snoring, pauses in 
breathing, cough, sweat, enuresis andrestless sleep 
[2,18]. The level of oxygen in blood falls, the pulse 
and the blood pressure oscillate and during sleep 
some changes in EEG and ECG may be observed. 
Daytime somnolence, fatigue, headaches, poor 
appetite, short attention span are caused by constant 
hypoxia and frequent arousals [14,16,19]. 
Moreover respiratory disorders and frequent infections 
of upper respiratory tract appear in children 
with sleep-disordered breathing [1,3,5,6,10]. Sleep 
apnea may lead to failure to thrive and to physical 
and mental delayin development, including cognitive 
disturbances [12,20]. 

Adenotonsillar hypertrophy plays a role in the 
pathogenesis of childhood sleep apnea. The size 
of the tonsils and adenoids increases during child-
hood;thus all children have some degree of adenotosillar 
hypertrophy. The lymphoid tissue in the 
upper airway increases in volume from birth to 
approximately 12 years of age. Simultaneouslythere 
is gradual growth in the size of the skeletal boundaries 
of the upper airway. Thus, between 3 and 6 

years of age, the tonsils and adenoids are largest in 
relation to the underlying upper airway size, resultingina 
relatively narrow upperairway.Other causes 
of sleep apnea in children include obesity, craniofacial 
and neuromuscular disease [14]. 

If the physicalexamination (including tonsil size) 
and clinical history do not provide for a reliable 
diagnosis, the gold standard–—polysomnography 
(PSG) can be ordered [2,10]. 

The aim of this study was to analyze the influence 
of adenotonsillar hypertrophy, causing obstructive 
sleep apnea on neurocognitive abnormalities. 

2. Subjects 
A total of 221 children from primary, secondary 
schools and from the last class of kindergarten were 
examined. One-hundred and seventeen children had 
obstructive sleep apnea caused by adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy: 87 children aged 6—9 years and 34 
children aged 10—13 years. Study group with adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy was examined before their 
adenotonsillectomy. 

The control group without adenotonsillar hypertrophy 
consisted of 104 healthy children in the 
similar age ranges (74 aged 6—9 years and 30 aged 
10—13 years). 

3. Methods 
Allpatientswiththeirparents filledoutthesymptoms 
questionnaire. Then children underwent complete 
physical examination, nocturnal polysomnography 
and psychological testing, to determine abilities 
and minor neurocoqnitive deficit. 

The questionnaire included inquiry about medical 
history, physiological, emotional and behavioural 


Neurocognitive abilities in children with adenotonsillar hypertrophy 

problems. The parents signed an informed consent 
from. 

Physical examination documented adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy and malocclusion. Tonsil size was 
graded from 1 to 4. 

Obstructive sleep apnea was confirmed by polysomnography-
Sleep/Lab/Pro/Erich Jaeger EmbH-
Wurzburg. PSG studies were performed overnight 
in a quiet, dark room. No sedation or sleep deprivation 
was used. During PSG the following parameters 
were recorded: electroencephalogram(C3,C4), sub-
mental surface electromyogram (EMG), surface EMG 
r/l tibialis anterior, electrooculogram (EOG), electrocardiogram 
(EKG), nasal airflow (thermistor), 
thoracic and abdominal effort, hemoglobin saturation 
(pulse oximetry), snoring (microphone). The 
obstructive apnea index (OAI) was defined as the 
number of obstructive apneas per hour of sleep. A 
diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea was based on 
PSG in patient with obstructive apnea index >1and 
oxygen desaturation SpO2 
< 
92% [10]. 

In neuropsychological tests we were interested in 
sensorimotor coordination, perception, memory, 
learning ability, concentration, focused attention 
and language reception. The token test (TT), diagnosis 
testofbraindysfunction(DCS-test),Luriaaudi-
toryverballearningtest(LAVLT)andtheReycomplex 
figure test (RCFT) were applied toboth groups. 

The token test includes tasks with progressively 
longer and more complex instructions and abstract 
concepts (form, size, colors), e.g. ‘‘show me a 
circle’’, ‘‘together with the yellow circle pick up 
the blue circle’’. The participant’s accuracy in performing 
these tasks is assessed. All the tasks are 
divided into five categories. In the first-each instruction 
includes one verb, adjective and noun. In the 
second category, sizeis addedin the instructions.In 
the third, a childhas to keep in mind size and colors 
of two tokens and in the fourth category size, colors 
and shape of two tokens. The fifth category, quite 
different from first to fourth includes instructions 
with different suffixes, conjunctions and adverbs. 
The token test measured verbal comprehension, 
memory, concentration ability and subtle language 
dysfunction in children [4]. 

The moto—visuo—spatial integration, concentration 
of attention, direct memory and learning ability 
were measured using the diagnosis test ofbrain dysfunction. 
It was an accurate and reliable diagnostic 
toolfor detecting minor neurocognitivedeficit [22]. 

The Luria auditory verbal learning test assessed 
direct auditory memory, learning ability, concentration 
and focused attention [8,13]. 

TheReytestrequires participantstocopyafigure 
while it is in view (the copy trial)(Fig.1). They are 
then asked to draw the figure again, but from

memory,inthe recall trial.Participants are awarded 
points for accuracy and placement of each element 
in the overall design. It was used to investigate 
perceptual organizational and also to detect 
visual—spatial deficit in children [15,23]. 

For all results the average values and standard 
deviations were calculated. Student’s t-test was 
used to compare differences in both groups of children. 
The minimum level of p< 
0.05 was set as 
statistically significant. 

4. Results 
The children with obstructive sleep apnea reported 
more problems with: snoring, difficult breathing by 
nose, mouth breathing, nasal congestion, cough, 
halitosis, reported frequent tonsillitis and frequent 
upper infection. But only differences in daytime 
somnolence( p= 0.04) and halitosis( p= 0.05) were 
statistically significant(Table1).

sleep apnea (usingafour-pointscale), butonly 
in 25% of the group with normal PSG findings 
(Table 2). 

Patients were classified to the group with 
apnea with OAI >1. Children with OAI <1were 
includedin thegroup withoutapnea.In86(80%) 
children, whohad hadsleep apneaforover1 year 
andin32(20%) children, whohadhad sleep apnea

found. 

The TT, DCS-test, RCFT were used to assess the 
level of sensorimotor integration and perception 

processes. The scores from these tests are compared 
in Table 3 (for 6—9-year old children) and 
in Table 4 (for 10—13-year old children). 

The differences in the means of all tests were 
statistically significant. Children with adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy attained lower results than healthy 
children. RCFT-copy was similar for both groups of 
children between 10 and 13 years old and the 
differences in mean results were statistically insignificant( 
p= 0.234). 

Decisions about whether to perform adenotonsillectomy 
was based on the history, physical examination, 
results of the sleep study and psychological 
tests. 

5. Discussion 
Children with sleep apnea caused by adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy had more problems with perception 
and sensorimotor integration. 

Brain areas, might be particularly susceptible, to 
damage from sleep-disordered breathingbegins during 
firstdecadeof life.Periodof rapid neurological 
development, traditionally associated with major 
brain growth and substantial acquisition of cognitive 
and intellectual capabilities.

Neurocognitive abilities in children with adenotonsillar hypertrophy 

DCS-test,TT,LAVLTand RCFTtestswere sensitive 
indicators of neurocognitive disability. 

Memory and learning abilities wereassessed using 
LAVLT. The differences obtained in bothgroups were 
large and statistically significant( p= 0.000), particularly 
for children between 10 and 13 years old. 
It means that that older children were found to 
have more severe deficits with direct memory and 
learning. 

Impaired functions were also confirmed by other 
tests: (1) usedto measure directmemory (RCFT, TT) 
and (2) learning ability (DCS-test). The differences 
obtained in the results were statistically significant 
(p< 
0.05). 

Language reception and memory was determined 
by using TT. All children with sleep apnea showed 
lower score than children with normal PSG findings. 
There were significant differences between groups 
on the TT but less than in other tests. 

The analysis of the results revealed no significant 
differences in the copy of the Rey complex figure 
test in children between 10 and 13 years old.Probably 
the inverse correlation occurs–—the older children 
are, the weaker sensorimotor integration and 
perception appear. 

Recent studies have shown that even primary 
snoring without OSAS is not as ‘‘benign’’ as was 
‘‘first’’ thought andis also associated with cognitive 
problems, including reduced verbal and global intelligence 
reduced attention and memory deficits [11]. 
By contrast Owens-Stivel et al. [17] report preliminary 
evidence that memory performance was not 
reduced in children with mild moderate and severe 
OSAS comparedto age norms. School problems have 
been reported repeatedlyin case seriesof children 
with sleep-disordered breathing which may in fact 
underlie poor test performance. Gozal [9] found a 
high incidence of sleep-disordered breathing (40%) 
in a study of 297 academic poor achievers. Of his 
40%, 18% children (who were functioning in the 
lowest-10th — percentile of their class) shored 
and showed nocturnal gas exchange abnormalities. 
Urschitz and Guenther [21] also reported that snoring 
was associated with poor performance in mathematics, 
science and spelling in third-grade school 
children. Current literature indicates that these 
neurocognitive deficits may be reversible by tonsillectomy 
and adenotonsillectomy. Gozal [9] showed 
that children with sleep-disordered breathing who 
were poor academic performers improved their 
grades after adenotonsillectomy. This did not apply 
to children without sleep-disordered breathing and 
to children with sleep-disordered breathing who 
refusedsurgical therapy. Friedman et al. [7] studied 
27 children with OSAS who had impaired neurocognitive 
function before and after adenotonsillect


omy. After treatment children in OSAS group 
showed improvement and approached the levels 
to the control group. 

6. Conclusion 
Sleep apnea might be responsible for a minimal 
brain dysfunction and for neurocognitive disabilities. 
That a reason of poor academic achievements 
obtained by children with adenotonsillar hypertrophy 
in school. 

This study shows that sleep apnea caused by 
adenotonsillar hypertrophy in children aged 6—9 
years is associated with: memory problems, concentration 
of attention deficits, learning disability, 
dysphasia, lower sensorimotor integration and perception. 


The older children (aged10—13 years) had memory 
problems and learning disabilities. They are 
likely to be caused by concentration of attention 
deficits. Older children had learning dysfunction. 

The results of the present study couldbe helpful 
in the process of making decision for or against 
surgery in doubtful cases. 

The association between adenotonsillar hypertrophy, 
neurocognitive deficits and behavior seems 
to be an important factor which should be taken 
under consideration by parents and teachers. It is 
important to know the problems connected with 
sleep-disordered breathing in order to recognize 
them and help the child develop through adequate 
treatment and cognitive stimulation.
