OBJECTIVE: We sought to reintroduce a historical 
procedure—intracapsular tonsillar reduction (partial 
tonsillectomy or tonsillotomy)—for tonsillar hypertrophy 
causing obstructive sleep disordered 
breathing (OSDB) in children, as well as to determine 
whether partial tonsillectomy, compared with 
conventional (total) tonsillectomy when performed 
by more than one surgeon, is equally effective for 
the relief of OSDB while resulting in less pain and 
more rapid recovery. 
STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective case 
series at a tertiary children’s hospital. The charts of 
children who underwent partial tonsillectomy and 
total tonsillectomy (1998 through 2002) for postoperative 
complications were reviewed. The caregivers 
were surveyed to assess postoperative pain, 
rapidity of recovery, and effectiveness of surgery 
for relieving symptoms of OSDB. 
RESULTS: Two hundred forty-three children underwent 
partial tonsillectomy and 107 children underwent 
total tonsillectomy. There were no significant 
differences in immediate and delayed complications 
between the groups. Both operations were 
equally effective in relieving OSDB. Children who 
had partial tonsillectomy had significantly less 
postoperative pain and significantly more rapid 
recovery.

CONCLUSION: Intracapsular tonsillar reduction with 
an endoscopic microdebrider relieves OSDB as effectively 
as conventional tonsillectomy, but results 
in less postoperative pain and a more rapid recovery. 
(Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg 2003;129:532-8.) 

The primary management of tonsillar hypertrophy 
causing obstructive sleep disordered breathing 
(OSDB) in children today is conventional (total) 
tonsillectomy by a variety of technical means 
(cold dissection, electrocautery, microbipolar, and 
harmonic scalpel). Removal of the tonsils (combined 
with adenoidectomy) eliminates the source 
of most children’s upper airway obstruction and 
improves nighttime breathing. Although effective, 
total tonsillectomy is often associated with a difficult 
recovery with prolonged pain and a low, but 
predictable, rate of delayed postoperative hemorrhage. 


In a search for a less invasive but equally effective 
technique, we revisited an old procedure— 
tonsillotomy, or partial tonsillectomy, but performed 
with contemporary technology. We 
perform a purposeful reduction in the tonsil size, 
partially shaving them away using an endoscopic 
microdebrider.1 The goal of this procedure is to 
eliminate the obstructive portion of the tonsil 
while preserving the tonsillar capsule. By maintaining 
the integrity of the capsule, a natural biologic 
dressing is left in place over the pharyngeal 
muscles, preventing them from sustaining injury, 
inflammation, and infection. This results in less 
postoperative pain, a more rapid recovery, and 
perhaps fewer delayed complications.1 

The goal of this study was to demonstrate the 
historical context of our procedure and to assess 
whether partial tonsillectomy compared to (total) 
conventional tonsillectomy, when performed by 
several surgeons in a larger cohort of patients, is 
equally effective for the relief of OSDB while 
resulting in less pain and a more rapid recovery.

PATIENTS AND METHODS 
Patients 

We reviewed the outpatient and inpatient medical 
records of all children (n . 
243, partial tonsillectomy 
group) who underwent intracapsular 
tonsillectomy for tonsillar hypertrophy causing 
OSDB performed by 1 of 3 surgeons (P.J.K., K.H., 
or T.I.A.) at the Children’s Hospital at the Cleveland 
Clinic between October 1998 and June 2002. 
The diagnosis of OSDB was based on the history 
provided by the child’s caregiver (snoring, gasping, 
apnea, restless sleep, frequent awakenings, 
bet wetting, and daytime somnolence). For comparison, 
we reviewed the outpatient and inpatient 
records of all children (n . 
107, total tonsillectomy 
group) who underwent standard tonsillectomy 
for tonsillar hypertrophy causing OSDB (ascertained 
by history) performed by the same 
surgeons during the same period at the same hospital. 
We also conducted a telephone survey of the 
primary caregivers of the children (211 [87% of 
caregivers] in the partial tonsillectomy group1 and 
90 [84%] in the total tonsillectomy group) by 
using a questionnaire that elicited their assessment 
of their children’s postoperative recovery and relief 
of the symptoms of OSDB. 

The choice of whether a child had a partial or 
total tonsillectomy was made preoperatively by 
the caregivers. Caregivers were told during the 
preoperative consultation that children who have 
partial tonsillectomy may have less postoperative 
discomfort compared with total tonsillectomy. 
They were also told that there was a risk of tonsillar 
regrowth after partial resection. 

Data collected from the outpatient records were 
the patient’s age, gender, and history of symptoms 
of OSDB. Data collected from the inpatient 
records were the amount of intraoperative blood 
loss and the occurrence of intraoperative complications, 
and immediate and delayed postoperative 
complications (dehydration and hemorrhage). 
Data obtained by the caregiver telephone survey 
included the caregiver’s subjective assessment of 
the child’s postoperative pain as being none, mild, 
moderate, or severe during recovery (on postoperative 
days 1 to 3, 4 to 6, and 7 to 9; after day 9; 
and globally); number of days until return to normal 
activity; number of days until return to normal 
diet; number of days of analgesic use; and relief of 

KOLTAI et al 533 

the symptoms of OSDB. The telephone surveys 
were conducted by one of the authors (C.A.S.) 
retrospectively and in an unblinded way, from 1 
month up to 12 months after the surgery. 

This study was approved by the Cleveland 
Clinic Foundation Institutional Review Board. 

Surgical Technique 

Orotracheal intubation is performed with the 
child in the Rose position. A mouth gag is used to 
retract the jaw. The soft palate is retracted with 
catheters in anticipation of a concurrent adenoidectomy; 
this stabilizes the tonsil and pulls the 
uvula out of the way. Resection begins with the 
left-side tonsil, with the microdebrider (set to 1500 
rpm in oscillating mode) held in the right hand, 
and moves from the inferior to the superior pole, 
starting medially and proceeding laterally. When 
the plane of the pillars has been reached, a Hurd 
elevator is used to retract the anterior pillar, medialize 
the remaining tonsil, and allow deeper portions 
of the tonsillar tissue to be shaved. Care is 
taken to leave a thin rim of lymphoid tissue on the 
tonsillar capsule. After resection has been completed, 
suction cautery is used to control the bleeding 
from the left-side tonsillar bed. The right-side 
tonsil is then similarly resected with the microdebrider 
held in the left hand. Power-assisted adenoidectomy2 
is performed in conjunction with 
most cases after the intracapsular tonsillectomy. 

The conventional (total) tonsillectomies were 
performed using the handheld electocautery wand 
at a setting of 10 to 15 W in a standard fashion by 
all 3 surgeons. 

Statistical Methods 

Descriptive statistics are given as median and 
quartiles (25th and 75th percentiles) for ordinal 
and nonnormally distributed continuous data and 
as frequency and percent for categorical data. 

The significance level for each hypothesis was 

0.05. SAS statistical software (Cary, NC) was 
used for all analyses. 
Univariable Methods 

Treatment techniques were compared on the 
ordinal outcomes (pain during recovery and postoperative 
quality of life improved), nonnormally 
distributed continuous outcomes (days to normal 


534 KOLTAI et al 

activity, days to normal diet, days of analgesic, 
and blood loss), and baseline predictors using the 
nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test. Techniques 
were compared on categorical predictors 
and outcomes with 2 tests. 

Multivariable Methods 

Because this was not a randomized study, it was 
important to adjust for any preoperative factors 
that might affect the outcome, especially factors 
that might be different between the technique 
groups. We considered age at surgery, gender, 
preoperative life affected, inpatient/outpatient status, 
tonsillar hypertrophy, adenoidal hypertrophy, 
OSDB symptoms, snoring, sinusitis, peritonsillar 
abcess, recurrent otitis, sleep problems, and apnea 
as potential covariates in multivariable analyses 
assessing the relationship between technique and 
the various outcomes. We also compared the technique 
groups on these variables. 

Cumulative logit regression models were used 
to compare the treatment techniques on pain during 
recovery and postoperative quality of life improved 
adjusting for covariates significant at the 

0.05 level using backwards variable selection. To 
satisfy the proportional odds assumption, the moderate 
and severe pain categories were sometimes 
combined. An odds ratio and 95% confidence interval 
(CI) are reported for each factor. The odds 
ratio indicates the odds of getting a worse outcome 
in the total versus the partial tonsillectomy. 
Cox proportional hazards regression models 
were used to compare the treatment techniques on 
the time-to-event outcomes (days to normal activity, 
days to normal diet, days of analgesic) adjusting 
for covariates significant at the 0.05 level 
using backwards selection. 

Regression models were used to compare the 
treatment techniques on the ranks of the continuous 
variables (blood loss and fluid infusion). 

The proportions with resolution (and 95% confidence 
interval [CI]) for those who had the symptoms 
before surgery are given.

for the children with tonsillar hypertrophy with 
OSDB. 

Significant associations between baseline predictors 
and treatment for the data are as follows: 
sleep problem (P . 
0.002), apnea (P . 
0.007), 
and surgery age (P . 
0.001). 

Tables 1 to 5 summarize the comparison of the 
partial tonsillectomy and total tonsillectomy on 
the main outcomes for our data. 

Univariable Results 

Partial tonsillectomy was significantly better 
than total tonsillectomy with less pain during recovery 
on day 1 to 3, day 4 to 6, day 7 to 9, day 
9, global pain, days to normal activity, days to 
normal diet, and days of analgesic. We did not 
detect a significant difference between techniques 
on the blood loss or postoperative life improved. 

Multivariable Results 

After adjusting for significant covariates (Tables 
3 and 4), partial tonsillectomy was significantly 
better than total tonsillectomy with less 
pain during recovery on days 1 to 3, days 4 to 6, 
days 7 to 9, day 9; global pain; days to normal 
activity; days to normal diet; and days of analgesic. 
Multivariable cumulative logit regression on 
the quartiles of blood loss indicated that total 
patients were significantly less likely to have 
greater blood loss compared to the partial tonsillectomy 
patients (estimated odds ratio [CI] 0.42 
[0.25, 0.71]) after adjusting for significant predictors 
sinusitis with OR (CI) 2.0 (1.02, 3.8) and age 
at surgery with OR (CI) 1.3 (1.2, 1.4) (Table 4). 
Due mainly to the partial patients being younger 
(Table 1) and the strong positive correlation between 
surgery age and blood loss, the age-adjusted 
analysis shows partial patients to have higher 
blood loss than total patients. Almost identical 
results were derived using quintiles of blood loss 
as the outcome.

first century AD by Celsus, who used a finger to 
remove the tonsil and when that method was ineffective, 
recommended a scalpel.3 Philip Physick 
of Philadelphia invented the first major advance in 
tonsil surgery when he described the tonsillotome 
or tonsil guillotine in 1828.4 With this instrument, 
tonsil surgery came to be performed with an increasing 
frequency. Contemporary tonsillectomy, 
a complete removal of the entire tonsil by anatomic 
dissection, was conceived and described by 
American otolaryngologists in the early 1900s in 
response to persistent symptoms that some pa


tients complained of and which were attributed to 
retained tonsillar tissue after tonsillotomy.5 G. 
Hudson Mauken of Philadelphia first made the 
distinction between an “intracapsular” and an “extracapsular” 
tonsillectomy.6 In 1910, Sluder7 and 
Whillis and Pybus8 independently published their 
techniques of tonsillectomy with a guillotine in 
which they were able to remove the tonsil in its 
entirety with the capsule intact. As a result, tonsillotomy 
fell into disrepute and was not readdressed 
in a meaningful way again for another 80 

9,10

years.

By the 1950s, the morbidity of conventional 
adenotonsillectomy came to be better understood 
and attention to hemostasis was intensified.11 
Electrocautery for control of tonsillar hemostasis 
for tonsillar bleeding is first mentioned in 196212 
and was initially used in conjunction with suction 
for controlling bleeding after cold dissection. By 
the 1980s, many surgeons had worked out a technique 
using the guarded blunt electrocautery tip as 
the primary instrument for the entire dissection. 
With the advantage of short operative time and 
minimal blood loss, the electrocautery dissection 
technique is probably the most common method of 
tonsillectomy in the United States today. However, 
postoperative pain, which is thought to be 
intensified by the thermal trauma of electrocautery, 
and delayed postoperative hemorrhage remain 
a problem, and the quest for improved techniques 
of total tonsillectomy continue.13,14 

Concurrent with the technical changes that have 
occurred over the past 100 years of tonsillectomy 
have been the changing indications. Although 
much of the historical literature addresses the 
problem of recurrent tonsillar infection, much of 
the current concern revolves around the problem 
of tonsillar hypertrophy resulting in obstructed 
breathing during sleep. This raises the question 
about the necessity of removing all of the tonsils 
when only part of them is causing the obstruction. 
Our experience and results suggest that the answer 
to this question is no. 

Clarification regarding the appropriate nomenclature 
of our procedure requires some comment. 
A guillotine tonsillotome performs a tonsillotomy, 
which literally means a “hole or incision” in the 
tonsil. We are doing something much more anatomic 
and purposeful. Intracapsular tonsillar reduction 
(we like the descriptive term “partial tonsillectomy”) 
specifically addresses the source of 
pharyngeal obstruction. At the same time, the operation 
maintains some of the native tissues as a 
surgical barrier and reduces the postoperative inflammation 
in the pharyngeal muscles, resulting in 
significantly less postoperative pain and a more 
rapid recovery. 

Another important aspect of partial tonsillectomy 
is concern about tonsillar regrowth and subsequent 
infection of the tonsillar remnant. Although 
this has not so far been observed in this 

KOLTAI et al 537 

group of patients, historical evidence suggests that 
eventually this will happen in some percentage of 
cases.15 Our concern is not trivial and has been the 
primary reason for considering chronic tonsillitis, 
and even infrequent tonsillitis, as a contraindication 
to partial tonsillectomy for now. We acknowledge 
these problems and recognize that they will 
be a cause of controversy. Nevertheless, today, 
when most tonsillectomies in children are done for 
hypertrophy, partial tonsillectomy relieves OSDB 
as effectively as total tonsillectomy but with less 
pain and perhaps a greater margin of safety. 

We have continued to use the endoscopic microdebrider, 
and thus far it seems to be the most 
useful device for partial tonsillectomy, although it 
is not ideal. None of the other techniques we have 
tried, including the guillotine,16 electrocautery,17 
CO2 laser,9,10 coblation,18 radiofrequency ablation,
19 and the harmonic scalpel,14 provide nearly 
as rapid, complete yet precise control in resecting 
the tonsil without violating the capsule. One disadvantage 
of the microdebrider is that it increases 
the intraoperative blood loss, which can obscure 
tissue specificity, especially in the deeper sections 
of the tonsillar excavation, risking injury of the 
pharyngeal musculature. This is preventable by 
maintaining visual contact with the cutting tip of 
the shaver blade, performing a layered resection 
and intermittently using the suction cautery to 
control excessive bleeders. 

Other negative considerations include the cost 
of the shaver blade, around $80, which increases 
the expense of the procedure. On the other hand, 
the same shaver blade may be used for both partial 
tonsillectomy and power-assisted adenoidectomy. 
Finally, microdebrider partial tonsillectomy takes 
a few minutes longer to perform than total electrocautery 
tonsillectomy, although the average difference 
in an informal survey of 20 conservative 
cases was only 3 minutes. 

As with any retrospective study, we attempted 
to control for factors other than surgical technique 
that might have an impact on patient outcome. 
However, our methodology using retrospective 
chart reviews and unblinded telephone surveys 
renders our results vulnerable to both recall bias 
and survey bias. Moreover, our preoperative explanation 
about the diminished postoperative pain 
expected with partial tonsillectomy introduces in

formation bias, which weakens the power of our 
results. A randomized trial will be an important 
step in clarifying the superiority of partial versus 
total tonsillectomy in all outcomes of interest. 

CONCLUSION 

We have revived an old style of tonsillar surgery, 
partial tonsillectomy, using contemporary 
technology in the form of an endoscopic microdebrider 
for the management of tonsillar hypertrophy 
causing OSDB in children. We have found the 
technique safe and reliable and have shown that it 
effectively relieves OSDB, but results in significantly 
less postoperative pain and a more rapid 
recovery compared with electrocautery dissection 
total tonsillectomy. We have not had a problem of 
tonsillar regrowth or subsequent chronic infection 
of the tonsil remnants in any of the children thus 
far treated.
