Obstructive sleep apnea causes intermittent elevation of systemic 
blood pressure (BP) during sleep. To determine whether obstructive 
apnea in children has a tonic effect on diurnal BP, 24-hour ambulatory 
blood pressure was obtained from 60 children with mean age 
of 10.8 . 
3.5 years. Thirty-nine children had obstructive apnea 
and 21 had primary snoring. Children with obstructive apnea had 
significantly greater mean BP variability during wakefulness and 
sleep, a higher night-to-day systolic BP, and a smaller nocturnal 
dipping of mean BP. Variability of mean arterial pressure during 
wakefulness was predicted by the desaturation, body mass, and 
arousal indices, whereas variability during sleep was predicted by 
apnea–hypopnea and body mass indices. Nocturnal BP dipping was 
predicted by the desaturation index. There were no significant differences 
in systolic, diastolic, or mean arterial BP during sleep between 
the groups. Diastolic BP during wakefulness was significantly 
different between the groups and correlated negatively with 
apnea–hypopnea index. We conclude that obstructive apnea in 
children is associated with 24-hour BP dysregulation and that, independent 
of obesity, the frequency of obstructive apnea, oxygen de-
saturation, and arousal contributes to abnormal BP control.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults increases the risk for 
heart failure, coronary artery disease, and stroke (1–3). The 
mechanisms underlying the link between OSA and cardiovascular 
diseases are not completely understood; however, systemic 
hypertension is thought to be one pathway leading to end-organ 
damage and cardiovascular morbidity (4–6). The early stages of 
abnormal blood pressure (BP) control may present with autonomic 
dysfunction in the form of increased sympathetic activity 
and/or decreased vagal tone. These autonomic changes alter the 
diurnal control and variability of BP (7). The adverse effect of 
abnormal BP control on the cardiovascular system is not only 
due to hypertension but also to earlier stages of abnormal BP 
control, such as increased BP variability and decreased nocturnal 
dipping (8–16). Because children with OSA, in comparison with 
children with primary snoring, are at greater risk for developing 
end-organ damage in the form of left ventricular hypertrophy 
(17), we hypothesized that children with OSA will demonstrate 
the earlier stages of abnormal BP control in the form of elevation

and decreased dipping of nocturnal BP and an increase in BP 
variability. Some of the results of these studies have been reported 
previously in the form of an abstract (18). 

METHODS 

Study Design 

Pediatric subjects who were referred for evaluation of obstructive 
breathing disorder during sleep underwent polysomnography (PSG) 
with continuous BP recording, followed by a 24-hour recording of 
ambulatory blood pressure (AMBP). Evaluation at the time of enrollment 
consisted of a history and physical examination, BP, and body 
mass index (BMI). All subjects presented with a history of snoring 
7 nights per week. PSG results were used to divide subjects into those 
with OSA and those with primary snoring. Subjects were classified 
as having primary snoring when they had no evidence of nocturnal 
hypoventilation and had an obstructive apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) 
between 0 and 1 per hour of sleep (Group 1). Subjects with AHI greater 
than 1 per hour of sleep were classified as having OSA and were further 
subdivided into two groups: those with AHI from 1 to 5 (Group 2) and 
those with AHI greater than 5 per hour of sleep (Group 3). Informed 
consent was obtained from the parents/legal guardian of each child, 
and assent was obtained from children older than 11 years of age. The 
Institutional Review Board of Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical 
Center, Ohio, approved the study. 

Study Group 

Subjects aged 5 to 17 years, who were referred to the pediatric Sleep 
Disorder Clinic at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center for 
evaluation of obstructive breathing during sleep, were recruited sequentially. 
Children with genetic syndromes, children with chronic medical 
conditions including psychiatric conditions and attention deficit/hyperactivity 
disorders, children with conditions that might alter BP, and 
children who receive daily medications were excluded from the study. 

PSG 

PSG studies were performed overnight according to the American 
Thoracic Society standards (19, 20) using computerized systems (Grass; 
Telefactor, West Warwick, RI). The following parameters were recorded 
during the study: (1 )EEG,(2 ) right and left electrooculogram, 

(3 ) submental and tibial EMG, (4 ) ECG, (5 ) nasal/oral airflow measured 
by thermocouple, (6 ) end-tidal Pco2 measured at the nose by 
infrared capnometry and SaO2 using the Nelcor N1000 (Nelcor, Van 
Nuys, CA) and oximeter pulse waveform, (7 ) snoring microphone, (8 ) 
video monitoring using an infrared video camera, and (9 ) chest and 
abdominal wall motion by computer-assisted respiratory inductance 
plethysmograph (Somnostar; Noninvasive Monitoring System Inc., Miami 
Beach, FL). 
The following parameters were measured. 

Sleep staging was scored according to published standards (21). 
Arousals were defined as recommended by the American Sleep Disorders 
Association (22). Awakening from sleep was defined as an increase 
in the frequency of the EEG for more than 15 seconds. 


Amin, Carroll, Jeffries, et al.: Blood Pressure in Children with Sleep Apnea 

Obstructive apnea was defined as the presence of chest/abdominal wall 
motion in the absence or decrease of airflow and/or the sum channel 
from the inductive plethysmography by more than 80% of the preceding 
breath. All obstructive events greater than or equal to two 
breaths duration were counted. 

Obstructive hypopnea was defined as a reduction in airflow and/or the 
sum channel from the inductive plethysmography between 20 to 
50% in the presence of chest/abdominal wall motion, associated 
with oxyhemoglobin desaturation greater than/or equal to 4% and 
or followed by an arousal. 

AHI was defined as the number of obstructive apneas and obstructive 
hypopneas per hour of sleep. 
Oxyhemoglobin desaturation index (DI) was defined as the number of 
events per hour of sleep when SaO2 decreased by 4% or greater. 

The average end-tidal Pco2 was calculated as an average of the maximum 
values per 30-second epoch. Maximum carbon dioxide (CO2) 
level and time spent during sleep with an end-tidal CO2 level above 
45 and 50 mm Hg were calculated. The diagnosis of alveolar hypo-
ventilation during sleep was made when two-thirds of the sleep time 
was spent with an end-tidal CO2 higher than 45 mm Hg and/or 10% 
of the time was spent with level above 50 mm Hg. 

BP Recording 

BP was recorded with a SpaceLab monitor (Spacelabs Medical, Redmond, 
WA). The reproducibility and validity of Spacelabs monitors 
have been extensively studied (23–28). Subjects were asked to keep a 
sleep diary and report their wake and sleep time. We ensured that 
sleep–wake time was clearly documented before an AMBP study was 
considered acceptable. When in doubt, the research coordinator contacted 
the child’s parent to confirm the reported data. The monitor was 
programmed to cycle every 15 minutes, giving a maximum number of 
measurements of 96 per 24 hours. The readings were divided into BP 
during wakefulness and BP during sleep on the basis of the information 
acquired from the sleep diary. The study was considered adequate when 
a minimum of 70% of the measurements were obtained without errors 
both for sleep and/or wake BP. The effect of BP recording on sleep 
was derived from the BP data acquired during PSG from 41 subjects. 
The percentage of BP measurements associated with an arousal or 
awakening in the 30-second epoch that preceded the measurement and 
the 30 seconds during the measurement was calculated. The BP cuff 
was placed around the same arm as the pulse oximeter. The timing of 
BP measurement could therefore be accurately determined because 
cuff inflation was associated with gradual loss of the pulse amplitude 
waveform obtained from the oximeter. The following parameters were 
obtained and/or calculated from the continuous BP recording. 

Measures of BP variability. BP variability was derived from the 24hour 
AMBP by calculating the average SD of awake and sleep systolic, 
diastolic, and mean BP. 

Measures of nocturnal BP dipping. The degree of systolic, diastolic, 
and mean BP dipping during sleep was derived by calculating the 
difference between awake and sleep BP obtained from 24-hour 
AMBP and expressed as a percentage of BP during wakefulness. 
To determine whether the change in the degree of BP dipping is 
stage specific, the difference between mean awake BP derived from 
the 24-hour AMBP and BP obtained during the PSG while awake in 
bed and during each stage of sleep was also calculated. A comparison 
between groups for night-to-day systolic BP ratio was performed, 
given its prognostic value in predicting future cardiovascular events 
(14, 15). 

Average BP during wakefulness and sleep. Average systolic, diastolic, 
and mean arterial BP during wakefulness and sleep was calculated. 
Pressure load was measured by calculating the percentage of systolic 
and diastolic BP measurements above the 95th percentile for awake 
BP. Published age-appropriate values for the 95th percentile for BP 
according to age and sex were used to determine the percentage of 
BP greater than the 95th percentile (29). 

Statistical Analysis 

All results are expressed as mean . 
SD. Log transformation of BMI, 
AHI, BP SDs and night-to-day systolic BP ratio was performed to 
achieve normal distribution. BP measurements were expressed as a 

mean of awake and sleep BP. To control for the effect of the wide age 
range on BP, we calculated the difference between measured BP and 
the published systolic and diastolic 95th percentile for each subject (30). 
We indexed this value to the 95th percentile using the following formula: 

(Measured BP . 
BP at 95th percentile) 

BP index . 
100 

BP at 95th percentile 

The average of this index was compared between groups. BP results 
were also expressed as a percentage of the 95th percentile and compared 
between groups. The BMI was converted into a Z score according to 
the standards published by the CDC (Z BMI) (31). For comparison of 
means, a one-factor analysis of variance was performed. An orthogonal 
contrast for a linear trend was used to determine if a linear trend existed 
across the mean of the groups: primary snorers, children with an AHI 
between 1 and 5, and children with an AHI greater than 5. Pearson 
correlation was performed between log-transformed BP measurements 
and log-transformed polysomnographic and demographic variables. 
Multiple regression analysis was performed to identify demographic 
and polysomnographic factors that might predict measures of BP variability 
and nocturnal BP dipping. The following independent variables 
were entered in a backward elimination regression analysis: age, sex, 
race, Z BMI, AHI, arousal index, DI, lowest SaO2, and maximum end-
tidal CO2. Variables with a p value less than or equal to 0.05 were kept 
in the model. To control for possible effect of BMI on nocturnal BP 
dipping, this variable was forced into the model despite a p value greater 
than 0.05. Race was also forced into the model to control for ethnicity. 

RESULTS 

Study Population 

Seventy-two subjects consented to participate in the study. 
Twelve subjects requested the discontinuation of BP recording 
during the night and refused to complete the 24-hour AMBP 
recording. Subjects who withdrew from the study were: 41% 
females, 11.6 . 
2.6 years old with a BMI of 28.7 . 
9.7. Sixty 
subjects completed the 24-hour AMBP monitoring. Forty-nine 
subjects completed the BP recording during the PSG and 24hour 
AMBP monitoring. Eleven subjects refused to complete 
BP monitoring during PSG but adequately completed the 24hour 
study. The demographic and polysomnographic characteristics 
are shown in Tables 1 and 2. 

Effect of BP Recording on Sleep 

The effect of BP recording on sleep efficiency and frequency of 
arousals was determined by calculating the percentage of BP

measurements obtained during the PSG that were associated 
with arousals and those associated with full awakening. Forty-
one of the 49 subjects who completed BP recording during PSG 
had data that could be accurately analyzed. The remaining eight 
subjects requested that the BP monitor be placed on the opposite 
arm from the oximeter; therefore, the exact timing of the measurement 
could not be estimated and the relationship between

Systolic, Diastolic, and Mean Arterial BP 

For daytime BP, a significant difference in diastolic BP was 
observed among the three groups with the lowest pressure seen 
in Group 3. There was no difference measured among groups for 
systolic or mean arterial BP. Similarly, there was no significant 
difference detected among groups for systolic, diastolic, and 
mean arterial BP during sleep. A trend toward a higher systolic 
BP during sleep was observed with increased severity of OSA

but did not reach statistical significance (Table 3). When BP 
index was used to normalize for the effect of age and growth 
on BP, a trend similar to the one seen with absolute BP was 
observed (Figure 1). A significant trend for diastolic BP index 
during wakefulness was demonstrated. There was no change in 
the trend of systolic and diastolic BP across groups when BP 
was expressed as a percentage of the 95th percentile (data not 
shown). There was also no significant difference in pressure load 
for systolic or diastolic BP among the three groups (Table 3). 

BP Variability 

A dose-dependent increase in BP variability was observed across 
the three groups with the largest SD seen in subjects with AHI 
greater than 5 per hour of sleep. A significant linear trend was 
found for the variability of awake systolic and mean arterial BP 
and for sleep systolic, diastolic, and mean BP (Figures 1 and 2).

Nocturnal BP Dipping 

A significant linear trend for the difference between awake and 
sleep BP expressed as a percentage of awake BP was observed 
for systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial BP from Groups 1 to 3. 
The trend from Group 1 to Group 3 was 11.5% 4.2, 8.6% 4.9, 
7.4% 7.3 for systolic BP (p 0.01); 17.5% 5, 14% 8, 
11% 9 for diastolic BP (p 0.01); and 13.4% 4.3, 10.6% . 
5.9, 8.4% 6.7 for mean arterial pressure (p 0.002). The ratio 
of night-to-day systolic BP was 0.88 0.04, 0.90 0.04, and 

0.93 0.07 for Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively (p 0.02). 
These results indicate that children with OSA have a night-today 
systolic BP ratio that surpasses the cutoff ratio of 0.899 for 
females and 0.9009 for males that is known to increase the risk 
for cardiovascular morbidity in adults (14, 15). The difference 
between awake BP and BP during different stages of sleep demonstrates 
that BP dipping during sleep is not stage specific and 
that the effect of OSA on nocturnal BP is similar during REM 
and non–REM sleep (Figure 3). 
Bivariate Correlations 

Diastolic BP during wakefulness correlated negatively with AHI 
and DI and positively with Z BMI. BP variability during wakefulness 
correlated positively with log AHI, DI, and Z BMI, 
whereas BP variability during sleep correlated positively with

the three groups, with the largest difference seen in Group 1 and the 
smallest in Group 3 (*p 0.05). Group 1 AHI less than 1 per hour

log AHI, maximum end-tidal CO2, and Z BMI. The degree of 
nocturnal BP dipping correlated negatively with measures of 
severity of OSA, namely, log AHI, DI, and maximum end-tidal 
CO2 (Table 4). These results show that there is an association 
between the degree of BP dysregulation and increased severity 
of OSA in children with sleep-disordered breathing. 

Multiple Regression Analysis 

BP variability. Variability of mean arterial pressure during 
wakefulness was predicted by a model (p 0.0001) that 
included DI (p 0.002), Z BMI (p 0.005), and arousal index 
(p 0.006). Variability of mean arterial pressure during sleep 
was predicted by a model (p 0.0001) that included AHI 
(p 0.001) and Z BMI (p 0.003). Models for BP variability and 
the dependent variables remained significant after controlling for 
ethnicity. 

Nocturnal dipping of BP. Nocturnal BP dipping was predicted 
by a model (p 0.015) that only included DI. The model 
and the dependent variable remained significant after controlling 
for Z BMI and ethnicity. 

These results suggest that sleep-related factors that affect BP 
variability during sleep differ from factors affecting variability 
during wakefulness and that intermittent oxygen desaturation 
contributes to BP dysregulation in children with OSA both during 
wakefulness and sleep. 

Diastolic BP. Diastolic BP index during wakefulness was 
predicted by a model (p . 
0.001) that included age 
(p 0.001), AHI (p 0.014), race (p 0.03), and Z BMI 
(p 0.04). 

DISCUSSION 

This study demonstrates that children with OSA show evidence 
of dysregulation of systemic BP in the form of increased BP 
variability and a decreased degree of nocturnal dipping and that 
BP dysregulation correlates with measures of severity of OSA. 

Previous studies have demonstrated that children with OSA 
tend to have higher systolic and/or diastolic BP compared with 
control subjects; however, the prevalence of systemic hypertension 
remained insignificant between the two groups (27, 32–35). 
In our study, we have shown that the early stages of BP dysregulation 
in children do not present with sustained elevation of BP 
but rather with an alteration in the circadian rhythm of BP 
profile and an increase in BP variability. Although this study 
concurs with previous observations as to the lack of significant 
difference in the prevalence of hypertension in children with 
OSA compared with control subjects, it differs regarding the 
trend of diastolic BP during sleep and during wakefulness. Marcus 
and coworkers (34) have shown that children with OSA 
tend to have a higher diastolic BP during sleep compared with 
children with primary snoring. We, on the contrary, showed 
no difference among groups in diastolic BP during sleep. The 
discrepancy between the two studies raises an important ques

tion as to whether the cardiovascular morbidity of OSA in children 
is age dependent, given the younger age of the population 
in Marcus’s study. Future studies are needed to determine if 
young age increases the susceptibility to cardiovascular morbidity 
from OSA. This study is the first to characterize the diurnal 
and nocturnal BP profile in children with OSA. We have observed 
in this study a lower diastolic BP during wakefulness in 
children with severe OSA compared with children with a milder 
degree of sleep apnea and children with simple snoring. Low 
diastolic BP during wakefulness seen in children with more severe 
OSA suggests abnormal elastic recoil of blood vessels during 
diastole. This finding, in addition to increased BP variability, 
could represent the early stages of autonomic and/or endothelial 
dysfunction in children with OSA (36–38). 

In hypertensive and normotensive adults, increased BP variability 
and decreased nocturnal BP dipping are associated with 
end-organ damage and increased risk for cardiovascular diseases 
(1, 2, 11, 12, 14–16, 22). In a prospective study that examined 
prognostic significance of BP variability in 1,542 subjects 40 years 
or older, Kikuya and coworkers (39) showed a significant linear 
relationship between daytime systolic AMBP variability and relative 
risk for cardiovascular mortality. In a study of 1,433 subjects, 
the variance of systolic BP was significantly associated 
with coronary artery disease after adjustment for mean systolic 
pressure (40). The relationship between BP variability and cerebrovascular 
diseases has been examined in several studies. Havlik 
and coworkers (10) demonstrated in a prospective study that 
systolic BP variability in midlife is associated with increased risk 
for white matter lesions in the brain later in life and that subjects 
who were in the highest category of systolic BP variability had 
significantly more brain atrophy. The importance of this observation 
stems from the knowledge that the presence of periventricular 
white matter lesions, which are thought to be caused by 
small-vessel disease, strongly correlates with progressive loss of 
cognitive function (18, 41, 42). Knowledge about the association 
between BP variability and adverse cardiovascular outcomes in 
children is limited. Because evidence is growing that children 
with symptoms of obstructive breathing during sleep are at an 
increased risk for low academic performance (43–46), further 
studies are needed to determine whether OSA-associated neurocognitive 
morbidity in children is related to BP dysregulation 
and small-vessel disease. 

Several studies have examined the relationship between 24hour 
BP profile and end-organ damage and have demonstrated 
that AMBP is superior prognostically to office BP (47, 48). Verdecchia 
and coworkers (14, 15) studied a group of 1,187 hypertensive 
subjects and 205 normotensive control subjects and found 
that a night-to-day systolic BP ratio greater than 0.899 for men 
and greater than 0.9009 for women was associated with significantly 
higher risk for cardiovascular events after adjusting for 

risk factors and 24-hour systolic BP. In our study, we demonstrate 
that children with OSA have a higher night-to-day systolic BP 
ratio compared with children with simple snoring. More recently, 
Hoshide and coworkers (49) examined the association between 
nondipping of nocturnal BP and left ventricular geometry in 
normotensive subjects. They demonstrated that left ventricular 
mass index and relative wall thickness were greater in nondippers 
than in dippers, suggesting that even in the absence of sustained 
diurnal or nocturnal hypertension, nondipping of BP increases the 
risk for myocardial damage. It is therefore plausible that the BP 
profile we described in children with sleep-disordered breathing 
could lead to future cardiovascular morbidity. 

We observed in this study that increased BP variability in 
subjects with OSA is present both during sleep and wakefulness, 
suggesting that the hemodynamic and blood gas abnormalities 
associated with OSA have a tonic effect on the cardiovascular 
system. In subjects with OSA, the repeated fall in intrathoracic 
pressure and the marked increase in left ventricular transmural 
pressure and afterload contribute largely to BP variability during 
sleep. In addition to the mechanical effects of OSA on the systemic 
circulation, there is also repeated activation of the central 
and peripheral chemoreceptors, which elicit both hyperventilation 
and increased sympathetic traffic to peripheral blood vessels. 
Simultaneously, the enhanced chemoreceptor response elicits 
an inhibitory response from the baroreceptors and pulmonary 
stretch receptors. Therefore, the final BP response and variability 
are the product of this intricate interaction among the chemoreceptors, 
baroreceptors, pulmonary stretch receptors, and the 
mechanical effect of OSA on cardiac dynamics and function (50, 
51). This study has shown that the AHI is a strong predictor of 
BP variability during sleep, whereas the frequency of oxygen 
desaturation is a strong predictor for daytime variability. A plausible 
explanation of these findings is that during wakefulness, 
when the mechanical effect of OSA is not affecting BP variability, 
there is a residual perturbing effect of intermittent hypoxia 
on the balance between chemoreceptor and baroreceptor function. 
We have also demonstrated that the DI is the best predictor 
of the degree of BP dipping. This suggests that intermittent 
hypoxia plays an important role in BP dysregulation in children 
with OSA. 

This study shows the independent effects of obesity and OSA 
on BP variability. This study has shown that BMI contributes 
to increased BP variability both during wakefulness and sleep. 
Studies that examined the changes in the autonomic nervous 
system among obese subjects showed that obesity is associated 
with decreased sympathetic and parasympathetic tone, altered 
ratio of sympathetic to parasympathetic tone, and decreased 
baroreceptor sensitivity. Both the duration of obesity and the 
fat distribution contribute to these autonomic changes (52–56). 
It is likely that obesity and OSA contribute to dysregulation of

BP by different mechanisms and independently contribute to 
cardiovascular morbidity. 

There are several limitations to this study. The control group 
consisted of children with primary snoring. It is possible that 
with normal control subjects a significant trend for mean BP 
across the three groups would have been identified. It is also 
likely that the small sample size provided limited power to detect 
a significant difference in nocturnal BP among the three groups. 
Although this study showed an independent effect of OSA on 
BP regulation, it does not address the possibility that OSA might 
have a differential effect on BP control in lean versus obese 
children. 

In summary, this study shows that children with OSA have 
evidence of BP dysregulation that manifests during sleep and 
wakefulness. These findings could represent the early stages 
of BP dysregulation, which could ultimately lead to sustained 
hypertension if OSA is left untreated or if additional risk factors 
for hypertension develop over time. Lack of nocturnal dipping 
and increased BP variability may also be useful in determining 
a subset of patients for whom more aggressive management of 
OSA is indicated.
