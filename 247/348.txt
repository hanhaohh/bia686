Aims:To investigate blood pressure (BP) in children with sleep disordered breathing (SDB). 
Methods:BP was measured during single night polysomnography in 23 suspected SDB child patients 
with adenotonsillar hypertrophy, but without respiratory or heart failure, or coma. The age related 

See end of article for changes of the observed BP were normalised to the BP index. The BP indices were examined in relation 
authors’ affiliations to SDB measures, such as the desaturation time (percentage of time with oxygen saturation (SaO2)

<90% against the total sleep time), SaO2 nadir, apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI), and arousal index, in 
Correspondence to: addition to age and body mass index (BMI). 
Dr J Kohyama, Division of Results:The systolic BP index during rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) tended to correlate with AHI, 
Human Ontogeny and while the diastolic index during REM sleep showed a significant correlation with AHI. The BP indices

leep 
disordered 
breathing 
(SDB) 
is 
known 
to 
be 
associated 
with 
hypertension 
in 
adults.1–3 
Although 
SDB 
occurs 
in 
about 
1–3% 
of 
children,45 
there 
are 
few 
studies 
on 
blood 
pressure 
(BP) 
in 
children 
with 
SDB,6–9 
even 
though 
the 
first 
description 
of 
this 
association 
appeared 
in 
1976.7 
Marcus 
et 
al 
were 
first 
to 
systematically 
study 
BP 
in 
children 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnoea 
syndrome,6 
and 
found 
that 
child 
patients 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnoea 
syndrome 
exhibited 
significantly 
higher 
diastolic 
BP 
during 
both 
wakefulness 
and 
sleep. 
In 
addition, 
they 
observed 
that 
all 
the 
subjects 
with 
increased 
BP 
values 
showed 
sleep 
related 
decreases 
in 
BP.6 
In 
adult 
SDB 
patients, 
however, 
both 
systolic 
and 
diastolic 
BP 
are 
known 
to 
be 
increased,12 
and 
some 
are 
known 
to 
lack 
the 
sleep 
related, 
nocturnal 
decrease, 
or 
“dip” 
in 
BP 
which 
is 
seen 
in 
normal 
subjects.10–13 
Since 
no 
other 
systemic 
studies 
have 
been 
performed 
on 
BP 
in 
paediatric 
SDB 
patients,5 
the 
exact 
nature 
of 
BP 
in 
paediatric 
SDB 
patients 
remains 
to 
be 
determined. 
This 
study 
aimed 
to 
investigate 
the 
nature 
of 
BP 
in 
children 
with 
SDB. 


METHODS 
Subjects 


Paediatric 
patients 
with 
suspected 
SDB 
underwent 
serial 
BP 
measurements 
during 
single 
night 
polysomnography. 
Informed 
consent 
was 
obtained 
from 
the 
guardians 
of 
each 
patient, 
and 
consent 
was 
also 
obtained 
from 
the 
child 
if 
older 
than 
5 
years 
of 
age. 
Patients 
were 
recruited 
sequentially 
from 
those 
referred 
to 
the 
Pediatric 
Clinic 
of 
Tokyo 
Medical 
and 
Dental 
University 
for 
evaluation 
of 
SDB. 
All 
children 
showed 
SDB 
secondary 
to 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy, 
but 
were 
free 
from 
cardiac, 
renal, 
or 
other 
diseases, 
and 
were 
taking 
no 
medication. 


A 
medical 
history 
was 
obtained 
and 
a 
physical 
examination 
performed 
by 
one 
of 
the 
investigators. 
Growth 
percentiles 
were 
obtained 
from 
standard 
growth 
charts. 
Children 
were 
considered 
obese 
if 
their 
weight 
was 
greater 
than 
120% 
of 
the 
ideal 
weight 
for 
their 
height. 
The 
body 
mass 
index 
(BMI) 
was 
defined 
as 
the 
weight 
(kilograms) 
divided 
by 
the 
square 
of 
the 
height 
(metres). 


Polysomnography 


Polysomnographic 
studies 
were 
performed 
overnight 
once 
for 
each 
subject. 
No 
sedation 
or 
sleep 
deprivation 
was 
used, 
and 
children 
were 
accompanied 
by 
a 
guardian 
throughout 
the 
night. 
All 
recordings 
were 
performed 
in 
an 
isolated 
semi-
soundproof 
recording 
room 
with 
an 
air 
conditioner 
(temperature 
range, 
22–24°C). 
Each 
polysomnographic 
session 
included 
an 
electroencephalogram 
(EEG), 
electro-oculogram, 
electromyography 
of 
the 
chin 
and 
trunk 
muscles, 
oxygen 
saturation 
(SaO2) 
monitoring 
(Ohmeda 
Biox 
3740; 
averaging 
time, 
6 
seconds), 
respiratory 
monitoring 
through 
respiratory 
inductive 
plethysmography 
(RIP), 
and 
video 
monitoring.14 
Oxygen 
desaturation 
measurements 
with 
the 
average 
time 
of 
6 
seconds 
were 
found 
to 
show 
no 
significant 
differences 
from 
those 
made 
with 
the 
control 
oximeter 
with 
an 
average 
time 
of 
3 
seconds.15 
Neither 
the 
end 
tidal 
nor 
transcutaneous 
level 
of 
carbon 
dioxide 
was 
measured. 
The 
children 
were 
continuously 
observed 
by 
one 
of 
the 
investigators. 
Sleep 
stages 
were 
determined 
according 
to 
the 
standard 
criteria.16 


Five 
minute 
qualitative 
diagnostic 
calibration 
(QDC) 
was 
performed 
before 
each 
RIP 
recording. 
One 
episode 
of 
apnoea 
was 
defined 
as 
10 
seconds 
or 
more 
of 
respiratory 
suppression 
that 
did 
not 
exceed 
25% 
of 
the 
baseline 
tidal 
volume 
determined 
during 
QDC.17 
Hypopnoea 
was 
defined 
on 
RIP 
as 
a 
series 
of 
breaths 
that 
was 
less 
than 
50% 
and 
greater 
than 
25% 
of 
the 
baseline 
tidal 
volume 
determined 
during 
QDC.17 
According 
to 
movements 
of 
the 
chest 
and 
abdominal 
portions 
during 
the 
respiratory 
suppression, 
a 
pause 
on 
RIP 
was 
taken 
as 
being 
obstructive 
or 
central.17 
Following 
Marcus 
and 
colleagues,18 
we 
did 
not 
count 
central 
apnoea 
following 
movement. 


We 
calculated 
four 
SDB 
measures: 
desaturation 
time 
(DT; 
percentage 
of 
time 
with 
SaO2 
<90% 
against 
the 
total 
sleep

and

index 
(ArI;

EEG 
arousal 
was 
determined 
using 
the 
criteria 
recommended 
by 
the 
American 
Sleep 
Disorders 
Association.19 


Blood 
pressure 


Systolic 
and 
diastolic 
BP 
were 
measured 
every 
15 
minutes 
during 
polysomnography, 
using 
an 
automated 
system 
(Colin 
Listminismart 
BP-8800SF) 
and 
an 
appropriately 
sized 
arm 
cuff. 
We 
discontinued 
BP 
measurement 
if 
it 
disturbed 
the 
patient’s 
sleep. 
Mean 
systolic 
and 
diastolic 
BP 
were 
calculated 
for 
each 
patient 
over 
the 
course 
of 
the 
night. 
Data 
obtained 
during 
periods 
of 
wakefulness 
(including 
before 
sleep 
onset, 
during 
the 
night, 
and 
after 
sleep), 
REMS, 
and 
non-REMS, 
were 
analysed 
separately. 


Because 
BP 
in 
children 
changes 
with 
growth 
and 
development, 
we 
normalised 
the 
obtained 
BP 
values 
by 
means 
of 
a 
BP 
index. 
This 
consisted 
of 
the 
difference 
between 
the 
subject’s 
mean 
systolic 
and 
diastolic 
BP 
during 
the 
night 
and 
the 
cut 
off 
systolic 
and 
diastolic 
BP 
values 
that 
are 
considered 
to 
be 
hypertensive 
according 
to 
the 
subject’s 
age 
(table 
1).20 
These 
values 
are 
similar 
to 
the 
established 
normative 
data 
collected 
for 
Japanese 
children,21 
although 
the 
cut 
off 
values 
were 
higher 
than 
the 
recently 
published 
values 
obtained 
for 
children 
in 
the 
USA.22 
Thus, 
a 
BP 
index 
was 
calculated 
both 
for 
systolic 
and 
diastolic 
BP, 
respectively. 
Patients 
were 
considered 
to 
be 
hypertensive 
if 
a 
BP 
index 
was 
positive. 


Statistical 
analysis 


The 
significance 
of 
correlation 
coefficients 
between 
BP 
indices 
and 
obtained 
parameters 
was 
assessed 
using 
the 
t 
test. 
Population 
characteristics 
on 
subdivision 
by 
means 
of 
AHI 
were 
compared 
using 
the 
unpaired 
t 
test 
and 
c2 
analysis. 
c2 
analysis 
was 
also 
used 
to 
compare 
the 
rate 
of 
patients 
who 
had 
no 
sleep 
related 
decrease 
of 
BP 
compared 
with 
wakefulness. 
BP 
indices 
in 
the 
two 
groups 
divided 
by 
the 
AHI 
were 
compared 
using 
the 
unpaired 
t 
test. 
Multiple 
linear 
regression 
was 
used 
to 
identify 
demographic, 
morphometric, 
and 
polysomnographic 
factors 
that 
might 
allow 
prediction 
of 
BP. 


RESULTS 


A 
total 
of 
32 
children 
were 
studied. 
In 
nine 
subjects, 
BP 
readings 
interfered 
with 
their 
sleep, 
and 
thus 
the 
BP 
portion 
of 
the 
study 
was 
discontinued. 
We 
therefore 
analysed 
the 
results 
obtained 
for 
23 
patients 
(22 
Japanese 
children 
and 
one 
Korean 
boy). 
A 
positive 
BP 
index 
was 
only 
obtained 
for 
the 
systolic 
index 
of 
one 
subject 
(ZS). 


The 
correlation 
coefficients 
between 
the 
six 
BP 
indices 
and 
age, 
BMI, 
DT, 
SaO2 
nadir, 
AHI, 
and 
ArI 
were 
calculated. 
The 
systolic 
BP 
index 
during 
REMS 
tended 
to 
correlate 
with 
AHI 
(r 
= 
0.413, 
p 
= 
0.0502), 
and 
the 
diastolic 
BP 
index 
during 
REMS 
showed 
a 
significant 
correlation 
with 
AHI 
(r 
= 
0.48, 
p 
= 
0.02). 
No 
other 
parameters 
exhibited 
significant 
correlations 
with 
BP 
indices. 


In 
accordance 
with 
these 
results, 
we 
used 
AHI 
to 
subdivide 
our 
patients. 
Conventionally, 
we 
set 
the 
cut 
off 
AHI 
value 
at 
10: 
there 
were 
16 
patients 
with 
an 
AHI 
of 
less 
than 
10 
(group 
AHIlow) 
and 
seven 
with 
an 
AHI 
of 
10 
or 
more 
(group 
AHIhigh) 
(table 
2). 
Accordingly, 
AHI 
showed 
a 
significant 
difference 
between 
the 
two 
groups. 
However, 
no 
significant 
differences 
in 
age, 
BMI, 
percentage 
of 
obese 
subjects, 
total 
sleep 
time, 
or 
rate 
of 
REMS 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
total 
sleep 
time 
were 
found 
between 
the 
two 
groups. 
The 
total 
sleep 
time 
and 
the 
rate 
of 
REMS 
were 
within 
normal 
limits 
for 
our 
laboratory.23 
In 
addition 
to 
AHI, 
DT, 
SaO2 
nadir, 
and 
ArI 
showed 
significant 
differences 
between 
the 
two 
groups. 
The 
ArI 
values 
in 
AHIlow 
corresponded 
to 
the 
reported 
normal 
value 
in 
prepubertal 
children 
(7 
± 2/h).24 
Table 
3 
shows 
the 
BP 
indices 
in 
AHIlow 
and 
AHIhigh. 
The 
patients 
in 
AHIhigh 
had 
significantly 
higher 
systolic 
and 
diastolic 
BP 
indices 
during 
both 
wakefulness 
and 
REMS, 
compared 
with 
those 
in 
AHIlow. 
However, 
the 
BP 
indices 
during 
non-REMS 
showed 
no 
significant 
differences 
between 
the 
two 
groups. 


Figure 
1 
shows 
the 
six 
average 
BP 
indices 
obtained 
for 
all 
23 
patients. 
In 
both 
AHIlow 
and 
AHIhigh 
groups, 
the 
average 
systolic 
and 
diastolic 
BP 
indices 
were 
highest 
in 
wakefulness 
and 
were 
lowest 
during 
non-REMS. 
In 
AHIlow, 
the 
mean 
diastolic 
BP 
index 
during 
wakefulness 
was 
significantly 
higher 
than 
that 
during 
REMS 
as 
well 
as 
during 
non-REMS 
(REMS, 
p 
= 
0.04; 
non-REMS, 
p 
< 
0.005). 
The 
average 
systolic 
BP 
index 
during 
wakefulness 
in 
AHIlow 
also 
exhibited 
a 
significantly 
higher 
value 
than 
that 
of 
non-REMS 
(p 
= 
0.03). 
This 
value 
was 
also 
higher 
than 
that 
of 
REMS, 
although 
statistical 
significance 
was 
not 
obtained 
(p 
= 
0.06). 
In 
AHIhigh, 
average 
systolic 
and 
diastolic 
BP 
indices 
during 
wakefulness 
showed 
higher 
values 
than 
those 
during 
REMS 
as 
well 
as 
those 
during 
non-REMS; 
however, 
these 
differences 
exhibited 
no 
statistically 
significant 
differences. 
No 
significant 
differences 
of 
BP 
indices 
were 
found 
between 
REMS 
and 
non-
REMS 
in 
both 
AHIlow 
and 
AHIhigh 
groups. 


Two 
of 
seven 
patients 
in 
AHIhigh 
(29%), 
including 
ZS, 
showed 
no 
dip 
of 
diastolic 
BP 
indices 
during 
sleep

dip 
in 
systolic 
BP 
indices 
during 
sleep. 
These 
rates 
did 
not 
show 
a 
statistically 
significant 
difference. 
Both 
systolic 
and 
diastolic 
BP 
indices 
of 
the 
other 
18 
patients 
decreased 
during 
sleep 
compared 
with 
wakefulness. 


For 
multiple 
linear 
regression 
analysis, 
we 
selected 
one 
of 
the 
two 
related 
variables, 
SaO2 
nadir 
and 
DT, 
that 
showed 
a 
high 
partial 
correlation 
coefficient. 
Because 
the 
correlation 
coefficient 
of 
DT 
with 
BP 
indices 
was 
lower 
than 
that 
of 
SaO2 
nadir 
with 
BP 
indices, 
DT 
was 
eliminated 
from 
the 
analysis. 
Thus, 
we 
selected 
age, 
BMI, 
SaO2 
nadir, 
AHI, 
and 
ArI 
as 
dependent 
predictor 
variables. 
SaO2 
nadir 
and 
AHI 
were 
log 
transformed. 
We 
obtained 
significantly 
predictable 
regression 
formulae 
for 
all 
six 
BP 
indices. 
The 
significance 
of 
regression 
coefficients 
was 
obtained 
for 
age 
(p 
< 
0.005), 
BMI 
(p 
< 
0.001), 
and 
AHI 
(p 
< 
0.02) 
with 
respect 
to 
systolic 
BP 
index 
during 
REMS, 
and 
for 
age 
(p 
< 
0.05) 
with 
respect 
to 
diastolic 
BP 
index 
during 
REMS. 
For 
the 
other 
four 
BP 
indices, 
all 
regression 
coefficients 
showed 
no 
statistical 
significance. 


DISCUSSION 


Children 
with 
hypertension 
related 
to 
SDB 
have 
been 
reported. 
However, 
most 
reports 
described 
children 
with 
severe 
SDB 
resulting 
in 
respiratory 
failure, 
heart 
failure, 
or 
coma.7–9 
Marcus 
et 
al 
performed 
the 
first 
systematic 
study 
on 
BP 
in 
children 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnoea 
syndrome.6 
Their 


subjects 
as 
well 
as 
our 
patients 
were 
free 
from 
the 
above 
mentioned 
life 
threatening 
conditions. 
Marcus 
et 
al 
found 
that 
these 
paediatric 
SDB 
patients 
exhibited 
significantly 
higher 
diastolic 
BP, 
both 
during 
wakefulness 
and 
sleep.6 
In 
our 
current 
physiological 
observation 
study, 
children 
in 
AHIhigh 
were 
found 
to 
exhibit 
higher 
diastolic 
as 
well 
as 
systolic 
BP 
indices 
during 
both 
wakefulness 
and 
REMS 
than 
those 
in 
AHIlow. 
Taking 
both 
results 
together, 
it 
could 
be 
concluded 
that 
BP 
in 
paediatric 
SDB 
patients 
without 
severe 
complications 
is 
positively 
correlated 
with 
the 
degree 
of 
SDB. 


Similar 
to 
Marcus 
and 
colleagues,6 
we 
found 
no 
statistically 
significant 
differences 
of 
BP 
indices 
between 
REMS 
and 
non-
REMS 
in 
both 
AHIlow 
and 
AHIhigh 
groups. 
Although 
Marcus 
et 
al 
observed 
that 
all 
subjects 
with 
increased 
BP 
values 
showed 
a 
sleep 
related 
decrease 
in 
BP,6 
our 
only 
hypertensive 
patient 
(ZS) 
lacked 
the 
sleep 
related 
dip 
in 
diastolic 
BP. 
Moreover, 
the 
sleep 
related 
dip 
in 
BP 
did 
not 
occur 
in 
the 
other 
four 
patients 
(one 
in 
AHIhigh, 
and 
three 
in 
AHIlow). 
Verdecchia 
et 
al 
reported 
that 
in 
adult 
patients 
with 
essential 
hypertension, 
a 
blunted 
nocturnal 
dip 
in 
BP 
was 
associated 
with 
subsequent 
cardiovascular 
morbidity.11 
Suzuki 
et 
al 
reported 
that 
50% 
of 
the 
normotensive 
adult 
SDB 
subjects 
lacked 
a 
sleep 
related 
dip 
in 
BP 
(less 
than 
10% 
decrease 
compared 
with 
wakefulness; 
non-dippers); 
43% 
of 
the 
hypertensive 
patients 
were 
also 
non-dippers.12 
Since 
we 
did 
not 
perform 
24 
hour 
measurement 
of 
BP, 
we 
could 
not 
identify 
non-dippers 
as 
well 
as 
dippers.10

However, 
we 
found 
the 
percentage 
of 
subjects 
who 
lacked 
sleep 
related 
decrease 
of 
BP 
to 
be 
29% 
in 
AHIhigh 
and 
19% 
in 
AHIlow, 
respectively. 
In 
addition, 
our 
only 
hypertensive 
patient 
(ZS) 
was 
found 
to 
lack 
this 
dip. 
According 
to 
Suzuki 
et 
al, 
in 
hypertensive 
non-dippers, 
respiratory 
disturbance 
index 
correlated 
well 
with 
average 
24 
hour 
systolic 
blood 
pressure.12 
Corresponding 
to 
this 
observation, 
ZS 
had 
a 
positive 
systolic 
BP 
index 
during 
wakefulness, 
an 
AHI 
of 
36.2, 
and 
an 
SaO2 
nadir 
of 
63%. 


Based 
on 
the 
result 
of 
simple 
correlation 
analysis, 
the 
degree 
of 
BP 
elevation 
during 
REMS 
was 
related 
to 
the 
AHI 
value, 
while 
that 
during 
non-REMS 
and 
wakefulness 
showed 
no 
correlation 
with 
the 
severity 
of 
SDB. 
Multiple 
regression 
analysis 
also 
showed 
that 
AHI 
was 
one 
of 
the 
significant 
determinants 
of 
the 
systolic 
BP 
index 
during 
REMS. 
BP 
during 
REMS 
might 
sensitively 
reflect 
the 
severity 
of 
SDB 
in 
children. 
Marked 
surges 
in 
arterial 
BP 
occur 
7–10 
seconds 
after 
each 
apnoea 
termination.1 
In 
children, 
SDB 
is 
very 
much 
a 
REMS 
related 
disease.24 
25 
Indeed, 
all 
of 
our 
seven 
patients 
in 
AHIhigh 
and 
13 
of 
our 
16 
patients 
in 
AHIlow 
had 
a 
higher 
AHI 
during 
REMS 
than 
during 
non-REMS 
(data 
not 
shown). 
Thus, 
in 
child 
SDB 
patients, 
marked 
surges 
in 
arterial 
BP 
are 
likely 
to 
occur 
more 
frequently 
in 
REMS 
than 
in 
non-REMS. 
The 
current 
study 
revealed 
that 
a 
significant 
elevation 
of 
BP 
indices 
in 
AHIhigh, 
rather 
than 
in 
AHIlow, 
was 
obtained 
for 
REMS 
and 
wakefulness 
but 
was 
not 
observed 
for 
non-REMS. 
Although 
mechanisms 
remain 
unknown, 
surges 
in 
BP 
associated 
with 
sleep 
apnoea 
during 
REMS 
might 
be 
closely 
involved 
in 
the 
production 
of 
sustained 
elevation 
of 
BP 
during 
REMS 
and 
wakefulness. 


Although 
in 
adult 
SDB 
patients 
who 
had 
apnoea 
both 
in 
REMS 
and 
non-REMS, 
the 
mean 
BP 
of 
REMS 
was 
reported 
to 
be 
significantly 
higher 
than 
that 
of 
non-REMS, 
not 
only 
during 
apnoea 
periods, 
but 
also 
in 
ventilatory 
periods.13 
Other 
factors 
than 
apnoea 
itself 
are 
likely 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
elevation 
of 
BP 
during 
REMS. 
Arousal 
is 
one 
candidate 
that 
could 
cause 
an 
elevation 
of 
BP. 
However, 
at 
least 
in 
the 
current 
study, 
ArI 
showed 
no 
significant 
correlations 
with 
BP 
indices. 
Hypoxia 
is 
another 
candidate 
for 
increasing 
BP 
in 
SDB 
patients.26 
However, 
according 
to 
our 
current 
multiple 
linear 
regression 
analysis, 
SaO2 
nadir 
showed 
no 
contribution 
to 
BP. 
Measurements 
of 
both 
BP 
and 
oxygen 
saturation 
with 
a 
shorter 
interval 
might 
produce 
a 
different 
result. 


We 
also 
found 
that 
BMI 
was 
one 
of 
the 
predictors 
of 
the 
systolic 
BP 
index 
during 
REMS 
in 
East 
Asian 
children. 
Similar 
observations 
were 
made 
by 
Hoffstein27 
and 
Coy 
and 
colleagues28 
in 
adults, 
and 
by 
Marcus 
and 
colleagues6 
in 
children, 
although 
these 
authors 
did 
not 
mention 
the 
races 
of 
their 
subjects. 
Recently, 
the 
role 
of 
obesity 
in 
SDB 
occurrence 
has 
been 
reported 
to 
be 
lower 
in 
Eastern 
people 
than 
in 
Western 
people.29 
In 
seems 
necessary 
to 
pay 
attention 
to 
racial 
differences 
when 
studying 
at 
least 
the 
physical 
constitution 
of 
SDB 
patients.
