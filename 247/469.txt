Summary 
Background: 
Major 
risk 
factors 
for 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
syndrome 
(OSAS) 
in 
children 
include 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy, 
neuromuscular 
disease 
and 
syndromes 
such 
as 
Down’s 
or 
Pierre—Robin’s 
syndrome; 
there 
is 
currently 
no 
consensus 
concerning 
diagnosis 
and 
therapy. 
Methods:

40 
children, 
aged 
2 
through 
14 
years, 
with 
macroscopic 
tonsillar 
hypertrophy 
(without 
recurrent 
tonsillitis 
but 
with 
OSAS) 
underwent 
adenotonsillectomy. 
Parents 
were 
invited 
to 
indicate 
the 
intensity 
of 
their 
children’s 
symptomatology 
using 
a

each 
patient 
underwent

analysis 
and 
polysomnography 
(PSG) 
before 
and 
after 
surgery. 
Results: 
The 
subjective

Introduction 
Obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
syndrome 
(OSAS) 
is 
characterized 
by 
prolonged, 
generally 
partial, 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
associated 
with 
hypoxemia, 
hypercapnia 
and 
the 
classic 
symptoms 
are 
snoring, 
apnea, 
and 
open 
mouth. 
The 
most 
common 
causes 
of 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
(OSA) 
are: 
nasal 
obstruction, 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy, 
tongue 
collapse, 
body 
mass, 
cleft 
palatale, 
craniofacial 
disorders, 
and 
genetic 
mechanisms 
(a 
familial 
basis 
has 
been 
reported) 
[1—5]. 
The 
symptoms, 
signs 
and 
possible 
complications 
depend 
from 
the 
type 
and 
gravity 
of 
OSA: 
poor 
school 
performance, 
somnolence, 
growth 
retardation 
(because 
the 
IGF-I 
axis 
is 
affected

children 
with 
OSAS), 
facial 
and 
chest 
deformation 
and 
cardiovascular 
diseases 
[2,6]. 
The 
diagnosis 
is 
made 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
anamnesis 
(parents), 
ENT 
examination, 
rhinomanometry, 
oxymetry, 
and 
the 
gold 
standard 
polysomnography 
(PSG) 
[7,8]. 


The 
aimof 
our 
study 
was 
to 
evaluate 
the 
treatment 
of 
OSA, 
in 
selected 
children, 
by 
means 
of 
a 
surgical 
approach 
based 
on 
inferior 
turbinotomy 
involving 
radiofrequencies 
and 
adenotonsillectomy. 


2. 
Material 
and 
methods 
In 
our 
study, 
we 
selected 
40 
children 
(aged 
2—14 
years; 
23 
male 
and 
17 
female) 
with 
a 
diagnosis 
of 
OSA. 
Before 
and 
a 
month 
after 
treatment, 
the 
patients 
underwent 
ENT 
examination, 
rhinomanometry, 
polysomnography, 
and 
subjective 
assessment 
of 
symptoms 
on 
a 
scale 
from 
0

3. 
Results 
We 
evaluated 
our 
surgical 
treatment 
of 
OSA 
in 
40 
children 
by 
means 
of 
Student’s 
t-test. 
Clinical 
examination 
revealed 
a 
hypertrophy 
of 
the 
tonsils 
and 
inferior 
turbinates. 
Symptoms 
recorded 
on 
the 
subjective 
scale 
fell 
from3.01 
before 
treatment 
to 
0.42 
after 
treatment 
(P 
< 
0.05). 
The 
total 
resistance 
to 
nasal 
airflow, 
as 
assessed 
by 
anterior 
rhinomanometry, 
decreased 
from0.892 
Pa 
s/cm3 
before 
surgery 
to 
0.125 
Pa 
s/cm3 
1 
month 
after 
surgery 
(P 
< 
0.05). 
Polysomnography 
revealed 
that 
obstructive 
events 
had 
been 
resolved 
in 
37 
patients 
and 
reduced 
in 


3. 
The 
RDI 
index 
fell 
froma 
mean 
of 
26.9 
before 
therapy 
to 
2.6 
after 
therapy 
(P 
< 
0.05). 
The 
average 
value 
of 
oxygen 
saturation 
rose 
from79% 
before 
treatment 
to 
95% 
after 
treatment. 
4. 
Discussion 
To 
treat 
OSA 
properly, 
a 
correct 
diagnosis 
must 
be 
made. 
The 
medical 
team 
has 
to 
recognize 
OSA, 
identify 
the 
correct 
procedure 
for 
diagnosis 
and 
the 
risks 
associated, 
and 
evaluate 
treatment 
options 
[7,8]. 
This 
can 
be 
achieved 
not 
only 
by 
means 
of 
ENT 
examination 
but 
also 
through 
instrumental 
studies 
such 
as 
rhinomanometry, 
polysomnography 
(polysomnography 
is 
recognized 
as 
the 
gold 
standard 
for 
diagnosing 
OSA, 
and 
there 
are 
currently 
no 
satisfactory 
alternatives) 
and 
oximetry, 
which 
appears 
to 
be 
specific 
but 
insensitive 
[7—9].Inour 
patients 
the 
clinic 
valuation 
showed 
a 
hypertrophy 
of 
adenotonsillar 
tissue 
and 
an 
increase 
of 
nasal 
total 
resistance 
caused 
fromhypertrophy 
of 
inferior 
turbinates. 
Adenotonsillectomy 
and 
inferior 
turbinectomy 
by 
radiofrequency 
were 
therefore 
undertaken. 
Adenotonsillectomy 
is 
the 
first-line 
treatment 
for 
OSAS 
but 
requires 
careful 
postoperative 
monitoring 
for 
the 
high 
risk 
of 
respiratory 
complications. 
This 
surgical 
operation 
is 
curative 
in 
75—100% 
of 
children 
with 
OSAS, 
including 
those 
who 
are 
obese 
or 
suffering 
fromcongenital 
central 
hypoventilation 
syndrome 
(CCHS) 
(sometimes 
enabled 
successful 
nasal 
mask 
ventilation). 
The 
risk 
of 
postoperative 
respiratory 
distress 
in 
such 
children 
is 
high 
[10]. 
It 
is 
important 
to 
rule 
out 
OSAS 
in 
children 
who 
are 
candidates 
for 
adenotonsillectomy 
so 
that 
such 
patients 
are 
not 
scheduled 
for 
ambulatory 
surgery, 
but 
rather 
given 
adequate 


postoperative 
monitoring 
and 
treatment 
[11]. 
Radiofrequency 
is 
effective 
in 
reducing 
the 
nasal 
resistance. 
We 
used 
radiofrequency 
in 
order 
to 
decrease 
the 
volume 
of 
the 
inferior 
turbinates. 
Radiofrequency 
can 
be 
applied 
to 
the 
nose, 
palate 
and 
tongue 
to 
treat 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
[12—16]. 
We 
preferred 
to 
use 
this 
method 
as 
it 
has 
a 
bland 
effect 
on 
the 
nasal 
mucosa. 
Radiofrequency 
causes 
coagulation 
of 
the 
submucosal 
tissue, 
and 
a 
reduction 
in 
the 
volume 
of 
the 
inferior 
turbinates 
can 
be 
observed 
after 
2—3 
weeks, 
without 
bleeding 
or 
nasal 
package 
[12]. 
For 
selected 
patients, 
craniofacial 
surgery 
may 
be 
helpful. 
Some 
children 
require 
continuous 
positive 
airway 
pressure 
or 
the 
nasopharyngeal 
tube. 
Tracheotomy 
is 
rarely 
indicated 
[9]. 
Newer 
treatment 
modalities, 
such 
as 
skeletal 
expansion 
using 
distraction 
osteogenesis 
to 
correct 
facial 
deformities 
of 
the 
mandible 
and 
midface, 
have 
changed 
treatment 
of 
OSA 
during 
childhood. 
Although 
still 
the 
gold 
standard 
of 
care 
in 
selected 
cases, 
tracheostomy 
is 
not 
a 
benign 
procedure 
and 
the 
toll 
on 
both 
the 
patient 
and 
family 
can 
be 
devastating 
[17,18]. 
However 
children 
with 
OSA 
usually 
respond 
well 
to 
adenotonsillectomy. 
Occasionally, 
uvulopalatopharyngeal 
procedures 
may 
be 
necessary. 
Craniofacial 
anomalies 
and 
significant 
skeletal 
anomalies 
such 
as 
severe 
mandibular 
hypoplasia 
have 
historically 
been 
problematic. 
Tracheostomies 
were 
at 
one 
time 
the 
only 
way 
to 
secure 
the 
airway 
in 
these 
patients. 
New 
developments 
in 
distraction 
osteogenesis 
have 
enabled 
mandibular 
lengthening 
and 
airway 
improvement, 
leading 
to 
earlier 
decannulation 
of 
these 
patients 
[19]. 
In 
selected 
patients 
other 
authors 
confirm 
the 
efficacy 
of 
an 
aggressive 
surgical 
approach 
to 
the 
treatment 
of 
OSA 
in 
children, 
avoiding 
the 
necessity 
for 
tracheostomy 
or 
permitting 
decannulation 
of 
permanent 
T 
in 
the 
majority 
of 
cases 
[20]. 
Also 
the 
surgical 
management 
of 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
in 
children 
with 
cerebral 
palsy 
were 
successfully 
managed 
without 
a 
tracheotomy. 
Tonsillectomy 
and/or 
adenoidectomy 
is 
recommended 
for 
initial 
surgical 
treatment 
of 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
in 
children 
with 
cerebral 
palsy 
[21]. 
Also 
we 
have 
to 
remember 
therapy 
with 
nCPAP 
eliminated 
the 
signs 
of 
OSA. 
nCPAP 
is 
an 
effective 
and 
generally 
well-tolerated 
therapy 
for 
treatment 
of 
OSA 
in 
infants 
and 
children 
(sometimes 
children 
could 
not 
tolerate 
nCPAP) 
[22]. 


5. 
Conclusion 
As 
there 
are 
various 
therapies 
for 
OSA 
in 
children, 
a 
correct 
clinical 
evaluation 
is 
very 
important. 
In 
our 
study, 
adenotonsillectomy 
proved 
to 
be 
an 



OSAS 
in 
children 
S231 


efficacious 
first-line 
approach 
in 
many 
cases, 
though 
other 
types 
of 
treatment 
cannot 
be 
disregarded.
