between 
obstructive

(OSA) 
syndrome 
and 
nocturnal 
enuresis 
(NE) 
in 
patients 
who 
required 
tonsillectomy 
or 
adenoidectomy. 
Study 
Design: 
Retrospective 
chart 
review 
with 
prospective 
collection 
of 
data. 
Methods: 
All 
charts 
of 
patients 
ages 
2 
to 
18 
years 
that 
had 
tonsillectomy 
or 
adenoidectomy 
over 
a 
44 
month 
period 
were 
reviewed 
for 
presence 
of 
NE 
and 
indication 
for 
surgery. 
Those 
patients 
with 
a 
positive 
history 
of 
both 
NE 
and 
OSA 
were 
surveyed 
to 
determine 
whether 
there 
was 
no 
change 
in 
enuresis, 
decreased 
enuresis, 
or 
no 
enuresis 
postoperatively. 
Results: 
Three 
hundred 
twenty-six 
children 
who 
had 
undergone 
tonsillectomy 
or 
adenotonsillectomy 
had 
data 
regarding 
enuresis 
available 
in 
their 
charts. 
One 
hundred 
seven 
of 
these 
326 
(32.8%) 
children 
had 
a 
positive 
history 
of 
enuresis. 
Of 
the 
107 
children 
with 
a 
positive 
history, 
44 
(41.1%) 
were 
female, 
and 
63 
(58.9%) 
were 
male. 
All 
107 
children 
with 
enuresis 
underwent 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA. 
None 
of 
the 
children 
who 
had 
a 
history 
of 
recurrent 
adenotonsillitis 
or 
chronic 
tonsillitis 
reported 
enuresis 
as 
a 
presenting 
symptom. 
Of 
the 
107 
children 
with 
a 
positive 
preoperative 
history 
of 
NE, 
57 
(53.3%) 
agreed 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
second 
phase 
of 
the 
study. 
Postoperatively, 
61.4% 
(35) 
of 
the 
children 
were 
free 
of 
enuresis, 
22.8% 


(13) 
had 
a 
decrease 
in 
enuresis, 
and 
15.8% 
(9) 
had 
no 
change 
in 
enuresis. 
A 
chi-square 
test 
showed 
a 
statistically 
significant 
difference 
among 
the 
groups 
(P 
< 
.0001). 
Conclusions: 
NE 
is 
a 
relatively 
common 
finding 
in 
children 
with 
OSA 
symptoms. 
NE 
resolves 
or 
markedly 
improves 
in 
the 
vast 
majority 
of 
these 
patients 
postoperatively.

INTRODUCTION 


Obstructive 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
is 
common 
in 
children. 
Most 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
in 
children 
is 
caused 
by 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy. 
Other 
causes 
include 
micrognathia, 
nasal 
obstruction, 
generalized 
facial 
anomalies, 
and 
laryngeal 
disorders.1 
Three 
to 
twelve 
percent 
of 
children 
snore, 
whereas 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
(OSA) 
syndrome 
affects 
1% 
to 
10% 
of 
children.2 
The 
majority 
of 
these 
children 
have 
mild 
symptoms 
and 
many 
outgrow 
the 
condition. 
However, 
left 
untreated, 
prolonged 
airway 
obstruction 
may 
result 
in 
significant 
hypercapnia 
and 
hypoxemia, 
as 
well 
as 
daytime 
sleepiness, 
irritability, 
hyperactivity, 
behavioral 
problems, 
personality 
changes, 
poor 
school 
performance, 
morning 
headaches, 
failure 
to 
thrive, 
and 
enuresis.2 
The 
patient 
is 
usually 
unaware 
of 
the 
airway 
obstruction 
during 
sleep, 
and 
thus, 
OSA 
usually 
progresses 
until 
symptoms 
appear. 
Most 
commonly, 
the 
first 
symptom 
is 
daytime 
sleepiness, 
followed 
by 
signs 
of 
decreasing 
mental 
function. 
If 
the 
disease 
is 
allowed 
to 
progress 
uncontrolled 
by 
surgical 
measures, 
it 
may 
become 
so 
severe 
as 
to 
cause 
pulmonary 
and 
systemic 
hypertension.3 


As 
demonstrated 
earlier, 
OSA 
and 
the 
symptoms 
that 
accompany 
it 
can 
be 
medically 
dangerous 
as 
well 
as 
socially 
troublesome. 
Nocturnal 
enuresis 
(NE) 
certainly 
falls 
into 
the 
latter 
category. 
It 
has 
been 
described 
in 
the 
literature 
but 
is 
much 
less 
emphasized 
than 
the 
more 
commonly 
recognized 
symptoms 
because 
many 
care 
providers 
do 
not 
make 
the 
association 
between 
NE 
and 
OSA. 
It 
is 
well 
accepted 
that 
adenotonsillectomy 
has 
excellent 
results 
in 
resolving 
the 
apneic 
symptoms; 
however, 
much 
less 
has 
been 
written 
about 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
adenotonsillectomy 
on 
the 
resolution 
of 
the 
symptom 
of 
enuresis. 


The 
aim 
of 
this 
article 
is 
to 
investigate 
the 
relationship 
between 
OSA 
syndrome 
and 
NE 
in 
patients 
who 
required 
tonsillectomy 
or 
adenoidectomy. 
It 
is 
our 
hypothesis 
that 
tonsillectomy 
or 
adenoidectomy 
performed 
to 
relieve 
OSA 
will 
also 
result 
in 
cessation 
of 
NE.

MATERIALS 
AND 
METHODS 


This 
study 
consisted 
of 
two 
phases: 
a 
retrospective 
chart 
review 
and 
prospective 
collection 
of 
data. 
In 
the 
first 
phase, 
all 
charts 
of 
patients 
who 
underwent 
tonsillectomy 
or 
adenoidectomy 
between 
January 
1, 
2001 
and 
August 
31, 
2004 
were 
reviewed. 
All 
patient 
charts 
found 
to 
have 
documentation 
regarding 
enuresis 
were 
selected. 
Among 
these 
patients, 
all 
children 
ages 
2 
to 
18 
were 
included 
in 
the 
study. 
On 
the 
basis 
of 
these 
inclusion 
criteria, 
326 
patients 
were 
involved 
in 
the 
study. 
Each 
of 
these 
patients’ 
charts 
were 
reviewed 
for 
presenting 
symptoms, 
indication 
of 
surgery, 
presence 
of 
NE 
preoperatively, 
age 
at 
the 
time 
of 
surgery, 
and 
sex 
of 
the 
patient. 


Those 
patients 
who 
on 
preoperative 
history 
and 
physical 
examination 
were 
identified 
to 
have 
NE 
as 
one 
of 
their 
presenting 
symptoms 
were 
then 
selected 
for 
the 
second 
phase 
of 
the 
study. 
This 
portion 
of 
the 
study 
consisted 
of 
a 
telephone 
call 
to 
the 
family’s 
home. 
The 
guardian 
of 
each 
child 
was 
asked 
about 
postoperative 
symptoms, 
including 
the 
presence 
or 
absence 
of 
snoring, 
witnessed 
apnea, 
restless 
sleep, 
NE, 
drooling, 
and 
mouth 
breathing. 
Any 
guardian 
who 
did 
not 
wish 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
second 
phase 
of 
the 
study 
had 
no 
further 
data 
collected. 


Information 
contributing 
to 
the 
database 
was 
collected 
between 
August 
2003 
and 
October 
2004, 
such 
that 
postoperative 
data 
collection 
occurred 
anywhere 
between 
2 
months 
and 
2 
years 
postoperatively, 
with 
an 
average 
of 
9 
months 
postoperatively. 
All 
data 
were 
then 
analyzed, 
and 
a 
chi-square 
test 
was 
performed 
to 
determine 
statistical 
significance. 


RESULTS 


In 
the 
57 
patients 
who 
completed 
both 
phases 
of 
the 
study, 
we 
observed 
a 
significant 
improvement 
or 
resolution 
of 
NE 
in 
84.2%. 
Figure 
1 
depicts 
the 
age 
distribution 
of 
our 
patients 
who 
were 
identified 
in 
this 
study. 
Of 
the 
326 
children 
involved 
in 
the 
study, 
107 
(32.8%) 
were 
found 
to 
have 
a 
preoperative 
history 
of 
NE. 
Sixty-three 
(58.9%) 
of 
the 
children 
were 
male, 
and 
44 
(41.1%) 
were 
female. 
One 
hundred 
percent 
of 
the 
children 
presenting 
with 
NE 
had 
a 
history 
of 
airway 
obstruction 
or 
OSA 
symptoms 
and 
had 
surgery 
performed 
to 
relieve 
the 
airway 
obstruction. 
Of 
the 
107 
children 
with 
a 
positive 
preoperative 
history 
of 
NE, 
57 
(53.3%) 
agree 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
second 
phase 
of 
the 
study. 
Thirty-five 
(61.4%) 
of 
these 
patients 
had 
total 
resolution 
of 
NE, 
13 
(22.8%) 
had 
a 
significant 
decrease 
in 
enuretic 
nights, 
and 
9 
(15.8%) 
had 
no 
change 
in 
NE 
postoperatively. 
Figure 
2 
depicts 
these 
results. 
Figure 
3 
shows 
the 
sex 
of 
the 
patients 
in 
each 
of 
the 
above 
mentioned 
groups. 
Of 
the 
nine 
patients 
with 
no 
change 
in 
NE, 
one 


patient 
has 
attention 
deficit 
disorder, 
and 
one 
patient 
still 
has 
nasal 
obstruction 
secondary 
to 
nasal 
trauma 
and 
fracture. 


All 
patients 
reported 
resolution 
of 
their 
other 
OSA 
symptoms 
postoperatively 
regardless 
of 
their 
enuretic 
status. 
To 
determine 
whether 
the 
results 
regarding 
enuresis 
were 
statistically 
significant, 
a 
chi-square 
test 
for 
equal 
proportions 
was 
performed. 
The 
chi-square 
value 
was 
found 
to 
be 
20.6316, 
resulting 
in 
P 
. 
.0001. 


DISCUSSION 


Our 
data 
provide 
convincing 
evidence 
that 
the 
presence 
of 
OSA 
plays 
a 
significant 
role 
in 
NE. 
NE 
is 
fairly 
common 
in 
children 
complaining 
of 
OSA 
symptoms, 
and 
in 
the 
vast 
majority 
of 
cases, 
it 
resolves 
or 
decreases 
significantly 
postoperatively. 
Although 
the 
literature 
discussing 
and 
analyzing 
the 
relationship 
between 
obstructive 
airway 
disease 
and 
NE 
is 
scarce, 
our 
data 
supports 
the 
same 
findings 
as 
those 
previously 
noted.3–5 


Brooks 
and 
Topol5 
studied 
115 
children 
with 
OSA 
and 
noted 
41% 
of 
these 
children 
to 
exhibit 
NE. 
Forty-nine 
percent 
of 
males 
were 
enuretic 
compared 
with 
31% 
of 
females. 
Our 
study 
closely 
mirrors 
their 
data, 
with 
an 
overall 
enuretic 
rate 
of 
32.8%; 
58.9% 
of 
our 
males 
were 
enuretic, 
and 
only 
41.1% 
of 
the 
females 
demonstrated 
preoperative 
enuresis. 
The 
study 
by 
Brooks 
and 
Topol 
did 
not 
investigate 
whether 
adenotonsillectomy 
resolved 
the 
enuresis 
noted 
in 
these 
patients. 


Weider 
et 
al.6 
also 
examined 
115 
children 
with 
NE 
and 
OSA. 
This 
study 
did 
investigate 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
adenotonsillectomy 
and 
found 
a 
76% 
improvement 
in 
enuresis 
symptoms 
after 
surgery. 
Our 
data 
reflected 
an 
overall 
improvement 
rate 
of 
84.2%. 
A 
complete 
elimination 
of 
enuresis 
was 
noted 
in 
61.4% 
of 
our 
patients, 
and 
a 
significant 
reduction 
in 
symptoms 
was 
noted 
in 
22.8%. 
Despite 
these 
impressive 
rates 
of 
effectiveness, 
it 
may 
still 
be 
premature 
to 
suggest 
NE, 
by 
itself, 
as 
an 
indication 
for 
tonsillectomy 
or 
adenoidectomy. 


An 
important 
question 
that 
arises 
as 
a 
result 
of 
our 
data 
are 
why 
are 
children 
with 
OSA 
at 
risk 
for 
NE? 
It 
is 
obvious 
that 
an 
association 
exists 
between 
OSA 
and 
NE, 
but 
what 
is 
the 
pathogenesis 
of 
this 
relationship? 
Current 
hypothesis 
include 
insufficient 
arousal 
response, 
insufficient 
vasopressin 
production 
during 
sleep, 
and

Others 
feel 
that 
the 
association 
between 
OSA 
and 
NE 
is 
related 
to 
increased 
levels 
of 
atrial 
natriuretic 
peptide.7 
Although 
there 
are 
pieces 
of 
evidence 
to 
support 
each 
of 
these 
hypotheses,4 
the 
exact 
cause 
remains 
unknown. 


With 
a 
growing 
body 
of 
literature 
on 
the 
relationship 
between 
OSA 
and 
NE 
constantly 
evolving, 
general 
practitioners 
will 
become 
more 
aware 
of 
this 
topic 
and 
incorporate 
evaluating 
the 
two 
as 
a 
pair 
in 
their 
daily 
practice. 
As 
a 
result, 
the 
pathogenesis 
might 
become 
clearer. 


CONCLUSION 


NE 
is 
a 
relatively 
common 
finding 
in 
children 
with 
OSA 
symptoms. 
As 
a 
result, 
OSA 
should 
be 
considered 
in 
the 
differential 
diagnosis 
of 
a 
child 
presenting 
with 
NE. 
Likewise, 
the 
presence 
of 
NE 
should 
be 
investigated 
in 
a 
child 
presenting 
with 
OSA 
symptoms. 


If 
surgery 
is 
indicated, 
one 
may 
reassure 
the 
patient 
and 
his 
parents 
that 
the 
NE 
has 
a 
60% 
to 
75% 
chance 
of 
resolving 
and 
an 
80% 
to 
85% 
chance 
of 
significantly 
improving 
in 
addition 
to 
relieving 
the 
other 
symptoms 
of 
OSA. 
Although 
these 
results 
are 
promising, 
we 
think 
it 
is 
still 
premature 
to 
classify 
NE 
as 
a 
sole 
indication 
for 
tonsillectomy 
or 
adenoidectomy, 
especially 
because 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
pathogenesis 
of 
this 
relationship 
is 
still 
unclear. 
This 
indication 
may 
change 
in 
the 
future 
as 
an 
increased 
number 
of 
people 
take 
interest 
in 
the 
relationship 
between 
OSA 
and 
NE.

In 
summary, 
there 
is 
a 
strong 
relationship 
between 
OSA 
and 
NE. 
NE 
is 
a 
relatively 
common 
finding 
(approximately 
35%) 
in 
children 
complaining 
of 
OSA 
symptoms. 
NE 
resolves 
or 
markedly 
improves 
in 
the 
vast 
majority 
of 
patients 
postoperatively.
