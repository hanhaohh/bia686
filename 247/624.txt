Summary 

Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is prevalent. There 
is evidence of their effect on quality of life. Aim: To 
assess the quality of life in children with SDB before and 
after adenoidectomy or adenotonsillectomy. Methods: A 
prospective ‘before and after’ interventional study, with a 
component for assessment. A consecutive sample of children 
referred to adenoidectomy or adenotonsillectomy was 
recruited from the otolaryngology clinic; guardians answered 
a specific survey for the evaluation of quality of life in 
children with SDB, the OSA-18, before and at least 30 days 
after surgery. Nasofibroscopic and otolaryngological exams 
and a semi-structured survey on the child’s social and clinical 
profile were done on both appointments. Results: 48 children 
with a mean age of 5.93 years (SD=2.43) were evaluated. 
The mean number of schooling years for guardians was 8.29 
years (SD=3.14). The most frequent symptoms were: agitated 
sleep, apnea and snoring. The total mean score of the initial 
OSA-18 was 82.83 (major impact); following surgery, the total 
mean score was 34.15. The differences in the total scores and 
in the domains between the initial OSA-18 and post-surgery 
scores were all significant (p<0.00). Conclusion: SDB has a 
relevant impact on quality of life, and patients show dramatic 
improvements after surgical treatment.

INTRODUCTION 


Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) refers to a spectrum 
of sleep-related breathing disorders sufficiently intense 
to cause clinical symptoms. This includes children with 
obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) or 
with upper airway resistance syndrome, in which the apnea 
index is frequently normal in standard polysomnography 
tests.1-2 The estimated occurrence of obstructive sleep 
apnea is 1-3% in preschool age children.3 The incidence 
of upper airway resistance syndrome is unknown, but 
appears to be even more prevalent than apnea.4 

Pharyngeal and palatine tonsillar hyperplasia is a 
frequent cause of nasal obstruction and chronic mouth 
breathing in childhood and the main cause of sleep-disordered 
breathing.1-13 Various clinical alterations may ensue, 
ranging from apnea with or without cardiopulmonary 
repercussions, to changes in craniofacial development, 
postural changes, atypical swallowing and unhealthy eating 
habits, among others.6 

Other than these widely studied and documented 
clinical findings, most SDB children are affected by the 
disease and/or the treatment, with serious repercussions on 
their quality of life. Zeitlhofer states that the quality of life 
(QOL) concept is an unique and personal perception of the 
state of health and/or non-medical aspects of life, which 
may be measured by asking the opinions of individuals 
(patients) through specific tools.14 Scientific studies have 
only recently began studies on this theme.8-10 A review of 
literature found a single published study in Brazilian scientific 
literature,11 which demonstrates the lack of research 
on sleep-disordered breathing in Brazil. 

Tools to measure QOL may be general or specific.15 
The former are descriptive instruments used to compare 
different populations and diseases, at the risk of being 
less sensitive to clinical aspects.15 The latter are based on 
the special features of a specific disease, aimed mostly at 
assessing physical aspects and the effect of treatment over 
time.15 These (specific) tools are more discriminative and 
predictive, being particularly useful in clinical trials.16 

Most of the available QOL tools are in English 
language, which means that their use in other languages 
requires not only validated translation but also awareness 
that they are specific to a social context. The researcher 
should then be sure that the domains under investigation 
are appropriate to the population in which the QOL tool 
is applied.15 

QOL and health state measures assessed from the 
perspective of the patient may be difficult or impossible 
in children, due to vocabulary differences and the varying 
sophistication of language in different age groups. The 
solution, then, is to use the answers provided by parents 
or caretakers to questionnaires, and then establish parallels 
with answers given by the children.8-9 Although 

debatable, this approximation method for answers is 
both necessary and desirable for a pediatric population, 
as children have different vocabulary levels which they 
use to answer assessment tool questions; added to this is 
the fact that in practice, adults will be the ones to apply 
medical decisions.17 

This study aims to assess the quality of life of sleep-
disordered breathing children prior to and following 
adenoidectomy or adenotonsillectomy.

 METHOD 


The trial was a prospective interventional non-
controlled before and after study using an evaluation 
component (QOL assessment). The study was conducted 
at the Walter Cantidio University Hospital otorhinolaryngology 
outpatient clinic in the Medical School of the Ceara 
Federal University, a reference hospital in the Brazilian 
public Unified Health System (Sistema Unico de Saude - 
SUS), located in the city of Fortaleza, Ceara state (Brazil). 
The study was approved by the hospital research ethics 
committee, protocol # 0105/04. 

A consecutive sample of children in which adenoidectomy 
or adenotonsillectomy had been indicated 
was recruited at the aforementioned otorhinolaryngology 
outpatient clinic. After signing a free consent form, a validated 
QOL assessment questionnaire specific for children 
with SDB (OSA-18 survey) was applied prior to surgery 
(base or preoperative assessment) and between 30 and 
90 days postoperatively (postoperative assessment). A 
questionnaire of symptoms was also applied, and children 
underwent a standard physical examination. The OSA-18 
survey is a health-geared QOL assessment tool and focuses 
on physical problems, functional limitations and emotional 
distress resulting from disease. It is a valid and reliable 
QOL measurement tool with sufficient discrimination for 
children with sleep-disordered breathing. In previous trials, 
the OSA-18 survey has demonstrated test-retest reliability 
and internal consistency. The questionnaire includes 18 
items grouped in 5 domains, where items are scored in an 
ordinal 7-point classification (1-none of the time, 2-hardly 
any of the time, 3- a little of the time, 4- some of the time, 
5- a good bit of the time, 6- most of the time, 7- all of the 
time). OSA-18 domains yield the following scores: 

a) sleep disturbances (4 items with scores between 
4 and 28) 

b) physical suffering (4 items with scores between 
4 and 28) 

c) emotional distress (3 items with scores between 
3 and 21) 

d) daytime problems (3 items with scores between 
3 and 21) 

e) parent or caretaker concern (4 items with scores 
between 4 and 28). The total OSA-18 score may therefore 
be between 18 and 126.

Total OSA-18 survey scores were classified into 
three groups according to the impact on the QOL of children: 
minor (scores below 60), moderate (scores between 
60 and 80) and major (scores above 80); we followed 
Franco et al’s18 prior validation. The OSA-18 survey also 
provides a global rate of obstructive sleep disorder related 
to the QOL through a 10-point analog visual scale with 
specific semantic anchors (smiles faces). Its translation 
into Portuguese for this study was done using the back-
translation technique in which, following a first translation 
from English into Portuguese by fluent and knowledgeable 
(of specific terms) professionals, a second translation is 
done back to English by similarly trained professionals, 
to check whether specific terms conform exactly to those 
used in the original document. 

Children aged below 12 years, with sleep-disordered 
breathing and an indication for adenoidectomy and/or 
adenotonsillectomy, all in treatment at the Otorhinolaryngology 
outpatient clinic, were included. Exclusion criteria 
were: children residing far from the outpatient clinic, 
children in situations where outpatient follow-up would 
have been impossible, immunocompromised children (severely 
malnourished, with primary immune deficiency and 
AIDS), children with craniofacial malformation causing or 
worsening the clinical picture of mouth breathing, children 
whose parents refused to participate in the study, children 
with a history of previous surgery or that had undergone 
inferior turbinate cauterization. 

Data was analyzed with Epi-info and Stats Direct 
software. The statistical significance level was p<0.05 
(bicaudal). A global score was calculated by summing 
the points in each domain (values between 18 and 126) 
to define the impact of SDB on QOL at the preoperative 
visit and postoperative consultation. The impact on QOL 
was classified in three groups: a) minor (scores below 
60); b) moderate (scores between 60 and 80) and major 
(scores above 80). Partial scores were also calculated for 
each domain by summing the items within each domain. 
The OSA-18 difference score was obtained from the difference 
between the preoperative and postoperative score 
means. The standard response mean (SRM) is defined as 
the score of the difference between the means divided 
by the standard deviation of the difference score, and is 
classified into three groups according to value: a) value of 

0.2 (minor effect), b) value of 0.5 (moderate effect), and c) 
value equal to or higher than 0.8 (major effect). Peason’s 
correlation was used for statistical analysis. The paired t-
test was used to compare score means and to establish the 
significance of score changes (before and after surgery). 
Non-parametric tests were used in cases where parametric 
tests were inadequate.
Three were not operated due to upper airway infection 
on the day of surgery, and three children did not return to 
the follow-up visit. The study population, therefore, was 
composed of 48 children, of which 58.30% (n=28) were 
male. The mean age at inclusion into the study was 5.93 
years (SD=2.43). The OSA-18 survey was answered by the 
main caretaker (the mother in over 80% of cases). 62.50% 
of the children slept in the same bedroom as the main 
caretaker. 23 of the caretakers (68.70%) had incomplete 
or complete junior or middle school education, and only 
2 (4.2%) were illiterate. The mean duration of caretaker 
school education was 8.29 years (SD=3.14). The mean 
duration of the complaint of respiratory disturbance was 

4.62 years (SD= 2.49). 
Clinical Assessment prior to surgery (Base Assessment) 

Patients presented nasal obstruction symptoms such 
as sialosis, restless sleep, apnea, snoring, repeat upper 
airway infection, repeat otitis, rhinorrhea and frequent 
sneezing during the preoperative assessment, as shown 
on Table 1. 

A history of disease included: pneumonia in 6 children 
(12.6%), repeat tonsillitis in 5 children (10.5%), asthma 
in 2 children (4.2%), prolonged stay in an incubator in 1 
child (2.1%), streptococcal glomerulonephritis in 1 child 
(2.1%), and early puberty in 1 child (2.1%). 

Otoscopy was normal in 33 patients (68.8%), revealed 
tympanic membrane opacification in 12 children 
(25.0%) and impacted cerumen in 3 children (6.2%) 

-which was removed prior to surgery for adequate otoscopy. 
Patients were distributed according to the degree 
of oropharyngeal obstruction by the palatine tonsils 
(Brodsky): grade I in 6 children (12.5%), grade II in 5 
children (10.4%), grade III in 22 children (45.8%), and 
grade IV in 5 children (31.3%). The classification of the 
degree of choanal obstruction by the pharyngeal tonsil 
(adenoid) seen during nasofibroscopy was: mild (up to 
40% obstruction) in 3 children (6.3%), moderate (between 
40 and 70%) in 9 children (18.8%), and severe (over 70%) 
in 36 children (74.9%). The mean choanal obstruction was 
73.65% (SD=14.86). 
Nasofibroscopy showed nine patients (18.8%) with 
secretion of mucous or pus in the middle meatus, suggesting 
rhinosinusitis. Thirty-seven patients (77.1%) presented 
combined palatine tonsil and adenoid hyperplasia. 

Forty-five patients underwent laryngoscopy as well 
as nasofibroscopy, of which 23 (51.1%) had a normal exam, 
19 (33.1%) presented signs of esophagopharyngolaryngeal 
reflux, 7 (14.4%) had vocal fold nodules, and 1 (2.2%) had 
signs of acute laryngitis. 

The body mass index (BMI) varied from 12.00 to 
22.60, with a mean value of 16.15 (SD=2.5) during the 
preoperative assessment, and 11.70 to 22.10 with a mean 
value of 16.46 (SD=2.48) during the second visit, which was

Table 2 shows the total OSA-18 item and domain 
mean scores and the QOL score in the global QOL visual 
scale on the preoperative assessment. The preoperative 
OSA-18 survey demonstrated minor impact on the QOL 
in 1 child (2.1%), moderate impact in 24 children (50%), 
and major impact in 23 children (47.9%). 

Since the mean duration of the complaint of SDB 
was approximately 5 years, this time period was used as 
the cutoff point to evaluate the duration of the complaint 
of respiratory disturbance and the impact on QOL. Only 
one child had a mild impact, which was discarded in 
the statistical analysis. There was no correlation between 
duration of the complaint equal to or over 5 years and 
the impact on QOL, according to OSA-18 survey criteria 
(Table 3). 

The correlation between the caretaker education 
level of 8 years or less (average number of study years 
of the caretaker and also the number of years required 
to complete basic schooling) and the degree of impact of 
sleep disturbance on QOL was not significant in the preoperative 
assessment (Table 3). Given that only one child 
presented mild impact, this datum was discarded in the 
statistical analysis. Even when the cutoff point was taken 
as 4 years or less (required time for completion of junior 
school) there was no statistical significance (p= 0.448). 

There was no significant difference in preoperative 
QOL scores in patients with findings suggesting esophagopharyngolaryngeal 
reflux compared to the impact detected 
on the preoperative assessment (Table 3). 

Postoperative assessment 

The mean time between surgery and the follow-up 
visit was 38.17 days (SD= 10.65). 

Nasofibroscopy was done in every child at this time. 
Only one child had persistent lymphoid tissue in the cavum 

(adenoid) that obstructed 60% of the choanae (moderate 
hyperplasia). All other children had postoperative remains 
of the adenoid obstructing 30% or less of the choanae. 

A correlation of the medical assessment after surgery 
with the impact on QOL according to the postoperative 
OSA-18 survey revealed that 47 (97.9%) of children were 
classified as having mild or low impact. 

Table 2 shows the mean preoperative and postoperative 
scores and their difference based on the OSA-18 
survey, as well as the standardized response mean (SRM) 
obtained through dividing the difference between mean 
scores by the standard deviation of the difference between 
the mean scores. The mean preoperative total score 
was 82.83 (SD=12.57), and the mean postoperative total 
score 34.30 (SD = 9.95), a statistically significant difference 
(p=0.000). The domain that presented the greatest pre and 
postoperative difference was sleep disturbances, followed 
by caretaker concern. The domain with the lowest difference 
was daytime problems. All total differences and 
domain scores (before and after surgery) were statistically 
significant (p= 0.000). Chart 1 illustrates the change pattern 
of the domain score means in the preoperative and 
postoperative OSA-18 surveys. 

There was a statistically significant difference (F 
test=443.70; p=0.0000) in the relation between the difference 
of the OSA-18 total score means compared to 
the visual scale score means (global assessment of SDB 
related to QOL). 

There was no statistically significant difference (F 
test=0.841; p=0.6714; Kruskal-Wallis p=0.472) in the assessment 
of the correlation between duration of complaint 
of sleep disturbances and the score differences in the 
preoperative and postoperative OSA-18 surveys. 

There was no statistically significant difference in 
the mean difference of scores in the preoperative and 
postoperative OSA-18 surveys according to female gender

Many published studies have demonstrated the 
impact of sleep-disordered breathing on the quality of 
life of children with this condition.4-5,8-10,18-33 Until recently, 
there was a single published Brazilian study on 
this theme.11 In this trial, Di Francesco et al. assessed 
the responses of parents or other caretakers of children 
undergoing adenotonsillectomy due to palatine and 
pharyngeal tonsil hyperplasia associated with sleep-
related breathing disorders. They analyzed 36 children 
aged between 2 and 15 years, with adenoids obstructing 
at least 75% of the air column as seen on a cavum 
radiograph, associated with increased palatine tonsils 
(grade II or more). The conclusion was that increased 
palatine tonsils and obstructive sleep apnea worsened 
the quality of life of these children, mostly due to physical 
suffering and sleep disturbances, and that adenoamigdalectomy 
results in a significant improvement of 
their quality of life.11 However, Di Francesco et al. used 
the OSD-6, an instrument that was not validated with 
polysomnography and with an unknown discriminating 
capability.4 Sohn et al.23 studied children with sleep-
related breathing disorders, comparing their quality 
of life before and after adenotonsillectomy, using the 
OSA-18 and the OSD-6 surveys. The authors concluded 
that the OSA-18 survey is adequate for a variety of situations, 
particularly when the progression of the patient 
is to be studied. It is easy to apply and may be used 
by physicians to generate marketing information, to 
improve the quality of service, for comparison purposes 
with findings of peers, or in association with objective 
research methods.23 

We used the OSA-18 survey because this tool

has been more completely validated and is thus able 
to provide a better assessment of the quality of life in 
children with sleep-disordered breathing. It is the first 
study on the quality of life of sleep-disordered breathing 
children in Brazil using this instrument. Consistency was 
assured by the fact that data was collected only by the 
main researcher. 

The OSA-18 survey was shown to be an adequate 
tool to study the quality of life of sleep-disordered breathing 
children. Over half of the caretakers in this study 
slept in the same room as the children we assessed; 
therefore, one may assume that the information they 
provided is of good quality. 

Few caretakers in this study had university level 
education, which reflects the Brazilian social reality. 
The sample included mostly low-income individuals, 
who use the Brazilian public Unified Health System. We 
know that in Brazil only 9% of people aged between 18 
and 24 years have access to university education, and 
that this percentage is even lower in the low-income 
strata of the population.34 

Sleep apnea in children and other sleep disturbances 
secondary to adenotonsillar hyperplasia are 
commonly found in the pediatric population. These conditions 
affect approximately 11% of children,1 similarly 
distributed between both sexes.19 Our study contained 
a similar number of males and females, different from 
studies such as the Mitchell et al. trial, in which males 
predominated.24-27 

Our study population presented a high rate of 
apnea (according to the caretaker’s perception), restless 
sleep and snoring (roughly 100% of our sample). This 
is probably due to the fact that these children had been 
previously selected as sleep-disordered breathing cases, 
both during outpatient care as in the clinical visit to 
confirm surgery and for inclusion into the study. Rather 
than evidence of any bias, this suggests an adequate 
selection of participants, namely children with sleep-
disordered breathing. 

In a similar trial, Franco Jr et al.18 found that 89% 
(61 children) of the participants had a BMC equal to 
or below 25kg/m2. According to this same criterion, 
no child in our study was overweight; comparing the 
proportions, there is a significant difference (p=0.04). 
However, this classification is based on first world 
parameters and does take into account the age of children 
and their origin, which in our case is composed 
of children with a low social and economic status. 
Participants of the study mentioned above18 also were 
mostly low income individuals, compared to North 
American standards. 

There was a minor impact on the quality of life in 

only 2.1% of our sample, as seen during the preoperative 
assessment; most of the sample showed moderate 
or major impact in roughly equal proportions. Franco 
Jr et al.18 found a more homogeneous distribution of 
the impact of sleep-disordered breathing on quality of 
life in their sample. However, this happened because 
children with indication for surgery due to repeat tonsillitis 
and without sleep-disordered breathing were 
also included. 

The average OSA-18 survey scores showed that 
the item with the highest mean score was loud snoring. 
There are controlled studies assessing children with 
polysomnography showing that the quality of life and 
the behavior of children without apnea but with primary 
snoring is altered compared to the control group.22,29,35 
The suggestion is that snoring needs to be investigated 
with greater care in clinical practice. 

The highest mean scoring domain during the preoperative 
assessment was caretaker concern, different 
from various other studies, in which sleep disturbance 
had the highest score.4,5,11,18,23-28,30 In our trial, sleep disturbance 
had the second highest score, which was the 
position of the item caretaker concern in the studies of 
Mitchell et al.24-27 and Tran et al.30 Other authors have 
found physical suffering as the second most affected 
domain.19,23 

The lowest mean scoring item in the preoperative 
assessment was drowsiness or excessive daytime 
naps, which is in line with current findings. Different 
from adults with obstructive sleep apnea, who generally 
present drowsiness, children tend to be more 
hyperactive. 

The average time between the beginning of 
respiratory complaints and surgery was considered 
high, especially if we take into account the mean age 
of our sample (5.93 years). Franco Jr et al.18 found an 
average symptom duration of 2 years. This may reflect 
the difficulty of accessing otorhinolaryngological health 
care -particularly surgical care -faced by patients using 
the Brazilian public Unified Health System, as detailed 
by Sarmento Júnior et al.36 The long waiting time may 
worsen the quality of life of these patients, which is 
a different situation from what is seen in studies in 
developed countries. On the other hand, there was 
no correlation between the duration of the complaint 
of sleep disturbance (less or more than 5 years) and 
the degree of impact on the quality of life as seen on 
the preoperative assessment. Our sample, however, is 
somewhat small. There is no information about this 
correlation so far in published quality of life and sleep-
disordered breathing studies. Therefore, we were unable 
to assess whether this is or not a peculiar finding in our

sample, possibly due to social and cultural factors. This 
may reflect a cultural passive acceptance of suffering 
among the low-income population in Northeastern Brazil 
that use the public health system, and frequently do 
not enforce their right to question long waiting times, 
merely accepting this fact as if it where normal.36 

Adenoidectomy and adenotonsillectomy 
are the most common surgical procedures in 
otorhinolaryngology.8-10,19 In adequately selected children, 
these measures can change the perception of 
quality of life and solve obstructive problems.19 We 
had a short follow-up period in our sample, which is a 
limitation of many of our analyses. Undeniably there is 
a substantial short-term improvement in the perception 
of quality of life by parents and caretakers of children 
with sleep-disordered breathing following surgery. 

Similar to international studies,19,23,24-27,29-31 we 
found significant improvements in all OSA-18 survey 
domains assessed before and after surgery. Follow-up 
time between surgery and the quality of life assessment 
was short. However, Mitchell et al. published a long-
term evaluation of quality of life changes (between 9 
and 24 months) following adenotonsillectomy for the 
treatment of obstructive sleep apnea, documented by 
full-night polysomnography, and concluded that parents 
perceived more pronounced short-term than long-term 
significant improvements in the quality of life of children 
after surgery, which were not uniformly distributed 
between all OSA-18 survey domains.25 

The standardized response mean (SRM) revealed 
a marked impact on all of the domains (SRM equal to 
or higher than 0.8), except for daytime problems, an 
item that showed a moderate impact. This confirms 
the significant effect of surgery on the quality of life of 
sleep-disordered breathing children. 

The most affected domain was sleep disturbances, 
similar to findings in international medical 
literature.19,23,25-27,29,30 However, the less affected position 
in our study was daytime problems, different from 
those studies, in which emotional distress was the least 
affected domain. This may be a cultural difference, 
as Latin populations are more expansive and active 
compared to the North American population, which 
was surveyed in the aforementioned studies. A second 
explanation would be the climate, as Brazil is mostly a 
tropical and subtropical country where, particularly in 
the Northeastern region, days are clear and sunny for 
most of the year, different from places in which those 
studies mentioned above were carried out. Although 
the domain daytime problems was the least affected 
in our study, the only item that did not show a statistically 
significant difference between the preoperative 

and postoperative assessments (with SRM showing a 
weak change effect) was discipline problems, which is 
included in the domain emotional distress. 

The change rate of the mean OSA-18 survey scores 
before and after surgery did not vary in patients with 
mild, moderate or major impact during the preoperative 
assessment. These findings are similar to those presented 
by Mitchell et al. in 2004.24 However, both studies 
have relatively small samples, which is a limitation. 

Similar to findings by Mitchell et al.,24 there was 
no significant gender difference in the mean preoperative 
and postoperative OSA-18 survey scores or the mean 
of the difference between scores. It should be noted 
that males predominate in Mitchell’s sample.24 

De Serres et al.5 remind us that resource allocation 
is currently a growing problem; they state that 
the personal impact of diseases and their treatments 
should be better understood, taking into account their 
standard medical morbidity or functional limitations, 
which should be included in the decision-making 
process. We saw a significant short-term change in the 
quality of life of sleep-disordered breathing children 
following surgery. We disapprove the long waiting 
time these children face until treatment. The Brazilian 
constitution assures universal health care, but political 
and economical reasons have made it impossible for the 
Brazilian public Unified Health System (Sistema Unico 
de Saude - SUS) to provide adequate care as originally 
intended.37 Resource allocation needs to be better 
equated, including observations of the impact diseases 
have on quality of life, especially in sleep-disordered 
breathing children, the object of this trial. 

Our study had limitations that should be considered. 
The sample size was small, and originated from 
a previously selected group, meaning that inferences 
about the general population may be somewhat jeopardized. 
However, the basic aim of this study was to 
analyze quality of life related specifically to a disease 
group, namely sleep-disordered breathing - which the 
sample fully supported. 

Polysomnography was not done in our sample. 
In daily clinical practice, high cost and difficulty in 
doing the exam preclude its use; in sleep-disordered 
breathing cases, it is only applied when a differential 
diagnosis is required. On the other hand, certain studies 
have suggested that even children with mild sleep-disordered 
breathing (primary snoring) show changes in 
measurements of attention, memory and intelligence 
compared to non-snorers.35 Furthermore, Flanary19 has 
demonstrated that, although polysomnography may 
provide information about children with sleep-disordered 
breathing, this exam is not necessary to establish

which patients will show improvements in quality of 
life following adenotonsillectomy. 

Another limitation of our study was the short 
follow-up time, not allowing inferences about the sustainability 
of quality of life improvements in children. 
There are studies such as those by Flanary19 and 
Mitchell,25 that have demonstrated this premise.

 CONCLUSION 


Sleep-disordered breathing due to adenotonsillar 
hyperplasia causes moderate to major repercussions on 
the quality of life of children. 

Adenoidectomy or adenotonsillectomy results 
in a significant quality of life improvement in these 
children.
