Summary 


Objective: 
To determine the prevalence of snoring in young children and to assess 
age, growth, previous surgery therapy, respiratory problems and sleep-related symptoms 
in relation to child’s snoring, and to evaluate the relationship between child’s 
snoring and parents’ snoring and smoking. 
Children 
and 
methods: 
Across-sectional study evaluated 2100 children 1—6 years of 
age in Helsinki, Finland. Child’s frequency of snoring on a five-point scale (never to 
every night) and age, height, weight and body mass index, previous adenotonsillectomies, 
tympanostomies, allergic rhinitis and respiratory infections were determined 
as was frequency of parental snoring and smoking. Sleep problems were determined 
based on Finnish or Swedish modified version of the sleep disturbance scale for 
Children. 
Results: 
Of the 2100 eligible children, 1471 (71%) returned questionnaires. Children 
always or often snoring numbered 92 (6.3%), sometimes snoring, 183 (12.4%), and 
never or occasionally snoring, 1196 (81.3%). No difference in age( p 
= 0.06) or gender 
(p 
= 0.39) existed between snorers and non-snorers. History of previous adenotonsillectomies 
(p 
< 
0.001), allergic rhinitis (p 
< 
0.001), recurrent respiratory infections( 
p 
< 
0.001), and otitis media( p 
< 
0.001) were more common among snorers 
than among occasional or never-snorers. Nocturnal symptoms such as breathing 
problems, sleep hyperhydrosis, sleep-wake transition disorders, and daytime somnolence 
were associated with children’s snoring. Frequency of children’s snoring was 
also associated with parental snoring( p 
< 
0.001) and smoking( p 
< 
0.001).

Conclusions: 
Snoring is common among young children and is associated with previous 
adenotonsillectomy, allergic rhinitis, respiratory infections, nocturnal symptoms, and 
parents’ snoring and smoking. The high prevalence of snoring among children with 
adenotonsillectomy raises the question whether adenotonsillectomy alone is adequate 
treatment for snoring in young children.

1. 
Introduction 
Snoring has been considered relatively common in 
youngchildren,withtheprevalence rangingfrom5% 
up to 20% [1—3]. Snoring frequency varies slightly 
among different age groups, being more common 
among preschool-age children than during older 
ones [4,5]. Occurrence of snoring is difficult to 
interpret because the criteria and definition of 
snoring vary markedly. Snoring associates with daytime 
symptoms such as behavioral problems and 
anxious and depressive symptoms and tiredness, 
as well as with night-time problems such as restless 
sleep, nocturnal sweating, teeth-grinding, sleep-
talking and nightmares [6—8]. 

Hypertrophy of adenotonsillar tissue is an important 
risk factor for snoring in childhood [9]. Adenotonsillectomy 
is by far the most widely performed 
procedure for snoringin youngchildren, andin most 
of the cases symptomatic improvement is rapid 
after adenotonsillectomy, but improvement after 
adenoidectomy without tonsillectomy is minor 
[10]. Small upper airways and mucosal inflammation 
may also be important risk factors [11]. Many have 
reported an association between snoring and allergic 
rhinitis [9], recurrent upper respiratory infections 
[1,12], passive smoking [13], and parents’ 
snoring [14]. 

The aim of the present study was to assess the 
prevalence of snoring in young children in Finland 
and to evaluate the child’s age and growth, previous 
upper respiratory surgery therapy, respiratory problems 
with child’s snoring as well as sleep-related 
symptoms and relationship between child’s snoring 
and parental snoring and smoking. 

2. 
Children 
and 
methods 
This studyisapartof larger epidemiologicalstudyof 
child’s sleep-related breathing disorders in Finland. 
A random sample of 2100 children born between 1 
September 1998 and 31 August 2005 was collected 
from the Population Register Center, Helsinki, Finland. 
The children came from both Finnish-and 
Swedish-speaking families. The sample accounted 
for 7% of the city population 1—6 years of age. The 
questionnaires were mailed to the children’s 

parents periodically from January 2005 to September 
2006, starting with the oldest age group (5—6 
years old). Each questionnaire included a prepaid 
return envelope. Families who failed to return it 
were re-contacted with a new questionnaire twice. 
Of the 2100 questionnaires, 12 did not reach the 
subject, 21 were completed for the wrong child, 
e.g., a sibling. Overall, 1494 questionnaires (72%) 
came back. Information on snoring frequency was 
available for 1471 (71%) children and was further 
analyzed. 

Children considered to snore were identified 
based on parents’ response to theitem ‘‘How often 
does your childsnore? ‘‘Symptoms during the past6 
months were described. Children were classified as 
snorersiftheywerereportedto snorealways,often, 
or sometimes (scores 3—5) or non-snorers if the 
answer was occasionally or never (scores 1—2). 
Child’s age, height and weight, previous surgery, 
and upper respiratory and middle ear infections 
were recorded. History of allergic rhinitis was 
assessed with the answer: ‘‘Does your child have 
allergic rhinitis?’’ ‘‘Respiratory infections were 
assessed to the question’’: ‘‘Does your child have 
upper respiratory infection episodes?’’ (common 
colds, cough, or sore throat during the last 6 
months). A response of often or always (scores 4— 
5) was defined as having recurrent respiratoryinfections. 
The amount of acute otitis media was determined 
with the options none, one, two, three, or 
over four episodes during the past 6 months. Children 
having four or more episodes of acute otitis 
media during the past 6 months were classified as 
having recurrent otitis media. 

Snoring and sleep problems were evaluated more 
extensively by a Finnish or Swedish modified version 
of the sleep disturbance scale for children (SDSC), 
an instrument for assessing the frequency of sleep 
problems on a five-point scale (1 = never, 2 = occasionally 
(1—2 times/month), 3= sometimes (1—2 
times/week), 4= often (3—5 times/week) 
5= always (every day/night)) [15]. The SDSC consists 
of 26 items grouped into six subscales: (1) 
disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep (sleep 
latency, going to bed reluctantly, difficulty falling 
asleep, falling-asleep anxiety, night awakenings, 
difficulty in falling asleep after awakenings), (2) 
sleep-breathing disorders (breathing problems, 


All snoring is not adenoids 

sleep apnea), (3) disorders of arousal/nightmares 
(sleepwalking, sleep terrors, nightmares), (4) 
sleep—wake transition disorders (hypnic jerks, 
rhythmic movement disorders, hypnagogic hallucinations,
nocturnal hyperkinesia, sleep talking, bruxism), 
(5) disorders of excessive somnolence 
(difficulty in waking up, tiredness when waking 
up, daytime somnolence, sleep paralysis, bed-wetting) 
and (6) sleep hyperhydrosis (night sweating, 
falling asleep sweating).Parents’ snoring frequency 
was classified on a five-point scale (non-snorers: 
scales 1—2, snorers: scales 3—5), and smoking was 
assessed as only ‘‘yes/no’’. 

Thestudy was approvedbytheEthicsCommittee, 
Helsinki University Hospital, and informed written 
consent was provided by the children’s care-givers. 

2.1. 
Statistical 
analysis 
Results were expressed as means (S.D.) for continuous 
data. Independent t-tests orPearson’s Chi-
square testswere usedto assessgroup differencesin 
demographic variables. Age variables were tested 
by the Mann—Whitney U-test, and Spearman rank 
correlation coefficients served to evaluate nocturnal 
symptoms of snoring and non-snoring children. 
All analyses were done with statistical software 
(NCSS and PASS 2004. Number Cruncher Statistical 
Systems, Kaysville, UT). p-Value less than 0.01 were 
considered to indicate statistical significance. 

3. 
Results 
The always or often snoring, 92 (6.3%) and sometimes 
snoring, 183 (12.4%) children were classified 
as snorers (n 
= 275, 18.7%). Never or occasionally 
snoring children numbered 1196 (81.3%). Ages ranged 
from 12 to 84 months(mean 46 months), and 719 
(48.1%) were boys. No differences were apparent 
between snorers and non-snorers regarding age or 
gender(Table1). Snoring prevalence did not differ 
between age groups(Fig.1). 

Of the 1471 analyzed, 214 (15%) children had 
undergone adenoidectomy and 51 (3.7%) tonsillectomy. 
The number of adenoidectomies and tympanostomies 
was significantly higher in the snoring 
than in the non-snoring group: 63; 24% vs. 151; 
13%, and 61; 22% vs. 154; 13%( p 
< 
0.001)(Table1). 

Allergic rhinitis was more commonin the snoring 
group (65; 24% vs. 171; 14%, p 
< 
0.001). In the 
previous 6 months, 28% of children have had over 
four episodes of acute otitis media. Recurrent 
respiratory infections (58; 21% vs. 109; 9.3%, 
p 
< 
0.001) and otitis media (105; 38% vs. 307; 
26%, p 
< 
0.001) were more common among snorers 
(Table 1).

Smoking was reported in 32.5% of families for 
either or both parents. Among snoring children, 
parental smoking, especially maternal smoking, 
was more common than among the non-snorers 
(40; 20% vs. 96; 10%, p 
<

was significantly higher in the snoring group than in 
the non-snoring group( p

Discussion 
In the present study based on the random sampling 
of Population Register Center data, we found that 
the prevalence of snoring in young children was 
common without significant changes with age: 19% 
of Finnish young children snore at least sometimes, 
and 7% are habitual snorers. Snoring associated with 
upper respiratory infections and acute otitis media, 
allergic rhinitis, and parental snoring and exposure 
to tobacco smoke and a child’s age was not predictive 
for snoring. Although most of these associated 
factors are already known risks for children’s 
snoring [9,12,13,16], we were surprised to find 
frequent snoring among children who had already 
undergone upper airway surgery. For a survey ofthe 
general population, overall response rate to the 
mailed questionnaires was good (72%). 

In Finland, the adenoidectomy rate for young 
children has been very high compared to that of 
other countries [17,18], and in our study population 
the overall adenoidectomy ratewas 15%. Most of the 
adenotomies werelikelytobeperformed becauseof 
recurrent ear infections, not because of snoring. 
Significant differences appeared in adenoidectomy 
rates between snoring (24%) and non-snoring children 
(13%). Adenotonsillectomy, widely accepted 
treatment of OSA oncethe diagnosis has been established,
is effective in most cases [2,19—23], but no 
good studies compare different modes of surgery in

All snoring is not adenoids 

OSA management, i.e. comparing the effectiveness 
of adenotomy, tonsillectomy and combined adenotonsillectomy 
[10,23—25]. Our findings suggest that 
removal of adenoids is often insufficient in treating 
snoring since a large portion of our snoring children 
already had adenotomies. In our study population, 
adenoidectomy alone may have been performedfor 
young children as the first treatment for snoring 
because of its lower morbidity and mortality than 
tonsillectomy. The overall number of tonsillectomies 
was lower, but the same trend emerged, 
tonsillectomies being 6% among snoring but only 
3% among non-snoring children. 

Snoring children were heavier, and if the trend 
toward obesity in children [26] continues, obesity 
may becomeamore important risk factorfor snoring 
even in young children. Like some others [27],we 
saw no significant difference in snoring prevalence 
by gender. 

Similarly, as in other studies, we found a significant 
association between snoring frequency and 
breathing problems, excessive night-time sweating, 
tiredness upon waking, and daytime somnolence, as 
well as sleep—wake transition disorders. Conversely, 
we found no relationship between snoring 
frequency and disorders of initiating or maintaining 
sleep, similar to results from other studies [8,28]. 

Of our children, one-third had a smoking parent. 
Smoking and even passive smoking has been an 
independent risk factor for snoring in adults [29], 
and children suffering from snoring are more likely 
to live in smoking households [30,31]. Ali et al. 
demonstrated a dose—response relationship 
between passive smoking and habitual snoring in 
children, especially for maternal smoking [32]. 
Although history of parental snoring indicates a role 
for heredity in development of snoring in young 
children [33—34], the relationship we found 
between parental snoring and snoring in children 
could be explained at least in part by parental 
smoking. 

As a conclusion we have shown that snoring is 
more commonin children and ona population level 
still exists after previous adenoidectomy and tonsillectomy. 
Snoring is often observed in children 
with tobacco smoke exposure.
