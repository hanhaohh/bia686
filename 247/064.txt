ENURESIS IN CHILDREN WITH SLEEP APNEA 

LEEJ.BROOKS,MD, AND HOWARD I.TOPOL 

Objectives To test the hypothesis that the presence of nocturnal enuresis is related to the severity of sleep apnea, we examined 
the relation between the Respiratory Disturbance Index (RDI, apneas plus hypopneas per hour of sleep) and the presence 
and severity of enuresis. 

Study design All children 4 years of age and older who were referred to our sleep center for suspected sleep disordered breathing 
(SDB) were asked whether and how frequently they currently wet the bed. All patients underwent full overnight polysomnography 
(PSG). The relation between RDI and enuresis was examined by .2 analysis. A value of P < .05 was considered statistically 
significant. 

Results Ninety boys and 70 girls were studied; 66 children (41%) described current enuresis. At all ages, enuresis was more 
prevalent in our patients than control patients in the literature. Children with an RDI of =1 had a significantly lower prevalence 
of enuresis (17%) than did children with an RDI >1 (47%) (P < .05). Fourteen percent of children with an RDI =1 had frequent 
enuresis, compared with 32% of children with an RDI >1 (P < .05). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of 
enuresis in children with an RDI 1 to 5, 5 to 15, or >15 (P = .92). 

Conclusions There is a high prevalence of enuresis in children with suspected sleep-disordered breathing. Children with an 
RDI >1 were at higher risk for enuresis than children with an RDI =1. This may be due to the effects of obstructive sleep apnea 
on arousal response, bladder pressure, or urinary hormone secretion. (J Pediatr 2003;142:515-8)

everal anecdotal reports describe a relation between nocturnal enuresis and 
obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults1-6 and children.7-10 Weider et al11 reported 
on 115 children with upper airway obstruction and enuresis, but only 11 of the 115 
children had polysomnography (PSG). To determine the prevalence of nocturnal enuresis 
in a group of children referred for suspected sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and 
whether the presence of enuresis is related to the severity of SDB, we examined the relation 
between sleep disordered breathing and parental report of enuresis in 160 children referred 
to our sleep center. 

METHODS 

Children who were referred to our pediatric sleep center (n = 160) underwent a detailed 
history, including a standard questionnaire, and a full physical examination. Patients 
and their families were asked whether or not the child currently wet the bed, and whether 
or not they had ever been dry for a 6-month period. The severity of enuresis was defined by 
the following criteria: frequently (=3/wk), sometimes (1 to 2/wk), rarely (<1/wk), or 
never. All patients underwent full overnight PSG. Patients reported to the laboratory for 
PSG 1 hour before their usual bedtime. Sixteen parameters were recorded. Six electroencephalographic 
leads (bilateral frontal, central, and occipital), bilateral electro-oculographic

leads, and submental electromyographic leads were applied. 
These surface leads were used to measure the stages of sleep, 
including time spent in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. 
Motion of the chest wall and abdomen were measured by respiratory 
inductance plethysmography (Respitrace, Ambulatory 
Monitoring Inc, Ardsley, NY). Air flow from the nose and 
mouth was measured with thermocouples. Oxyhemoglobin 
saturation was measured by pulse oximetry (N-200, Nellcor 
Inc, Hayward, Calif ). Body motion was recorded with pretibial 
electromyographic leads. Cardiac rhythm was monitored 
with standard electrocardiographic leads. All signals were 
recorded with 18- or 21-channel recorders (Model 78D, Grass 
Instruments, Quincy, Mass, or Model 4421A, Nihon Kohden, 
Irvine, Calif ). The patient and the strip chart were simultaneously 
videotaped with the use of split-screen technology to 
allow simultaneous review of physical and electrophysiologic 
findings.

Central apnea was defined as a 10-second period without 
air flow or respiratory effort. Obstructive apnea was defined 
as cessation of air flow for at least 10 seconds with 
paradoxic respiratory effort. Partial obstruction was defined as 
reduction in air flow with paradoxic chest wall and abdominal 
motion, resulting in either an arousal or an oxyhemoglobin 
desaturation of at least 4%. Hypopnea was defined as a reduction 
in air flow with synchronous chest wall and abdominal 
motion, resulting in either arousal or oxyhemoglobin desaturation 
of least 4%. 

The type, number, and duration of respiratory events 
were noted, as well as the median and minimum oxyhemoglobin 
saturation. The Respiratory Disturbance Index (RDI) was 
calculated as the average number of respiratory events per 
hour of sleep. 

Since the RDI was not normally distributed but skewed 
toward lower values, nonparametric statistics were used. Differences 
between boys and girls were examined by .2 or 
Mann-Whitney rank-sum test. The relation between RDI 
and age and body mass index (BMI) was examined by Spearman 
rank correlation coefficient. The relation between RDI 
and enuresis was examined by .2 analysis. A value of P < .05 
was considered statistically significant. The research was approved 
by the institutional review board. Informed consent 
was deemed not necessary because these data were routinely 
collected as part of standard clinical care. 

RESULTS 

The mean age of the children (n = 160) was 9.6 ± 3.58 
SD years, ranging from 4.2 to 17.9 years. There was no relation 
between RDI and age (rS = –.15, P > .20). There were 90 
boys and 70 girls. A total of 66 children (41%) currently described 
enuresis. Forty-nine percent of the boys were enuretic 
compared with 31% of the girls (P < .05). There was no difference 
in the RDI of the boys and girls (P = .91) (Table). The 
mean BMI (kg/m2) was 22.6 ± 8.71, ranging from 12.9 to 

64.2. There was no relation between BMI and RDI (rS = 0.09, 
P > .5) or the presence of enuresis (.2 = 3.08, P = .55). 
Enuresis was more prevalent in the younger children, 
but at all ages, enuresis was more prevalent in our patients 
than in control patients in the literature.12,13 Sixty-four percent 
of the children who wet the bed had primary enuresis, 
whereas 36% had secondary enuresis. 

Children with an RDI =1 had a significantly lower 
prevalence of nocturnal enuresis (27%) than did children with 
an RDI >1 (47%; .2 = 4.13, P < .05). Fourteen percent of children 
with an RDI =1 had enuresis frequently (=3 nights per 
week), compared with 32% of children with an RDI >1 (.2= 
4.52, P < .05). There was no significant difference in the 
prevalence of enuresis between children with RDIs 1 to 5, 5 to 
15,or >15 (.2 =.18, P = .92) (Figure). 

DISCUSSION 

These data demonstrate a high prevalence of nocturnal 
enuresis in children with suspected SDB. Children with more 
than one respiratory event per hour of sleep (RDI >1) were at 
significantly greater risk of enuresis than were children with an

RDI =1. In other studies, one obstructive apnea per hour of sleep 
has been suggested as the upper limit of normal for children.14 

The predisposition of boys to nocturnal enuresis and the 

3:1 ratio of primary to secondary enuresis are similar to descriptions 
of otherwise normal children.15 Wang et al16 found 
nocturnal enuresis in 24 of 82 children (29%) referred for suspected 
OSA. Eleven of the 24 had OSA confirmed on 
polysomnography, but no data were reported on the severity 
of OSA. Brouillette et al17 found nocturnal enuresis in 8% of 
children with OSA compared with 4% of control children. 
However, this was not a statistically significant difference, 
probably because of the small number of patients.17 
Several reports in adults2-6 and children7-11,18 describe 
patients with obstructive sleep apnea whose enuresis resolved 
on treating their OSA with continuous positive airway pressure 
(CPAP), dental devices, or adenotonsillectomy. Despite 
these reports, of 10 recent reviews of nocturnal enuresis in 
children, only 2 reviews19,20 mention SDB as a possible cause 
or association.21-28 

Why might children with SDB be at risk for nocturnal 
enuresis? Proposed causes for nocturnal enuresis include insufficient 
arousal response, impaired urodynamics, and insufficient 
vasopressin production during sleep. 

Children who wet the bed are reported by their parents 
to be more difficult to arouse from sleep than children without 
enuresis.29 Weider reported that “...a number of patients (with 
upper airway obstruction) who could not be aroused before 
surgery were able to wake up and go to the bathroom by 
themselves after surgery.”11 SDB may therefore promote 
enuresis by decreasing the arousal response,30 perhaps because 
of sleep fragmentation.30-32 

Daytime urodynamics are similar in children with and 
without enuresis.33 However, the increased intra-abdominal 
pressure caused by respiratory efforts against an obstructed 
airway can be transmitted to the bladder. Cystometrography 
has demonstrated that bladder pressure during sleep may rise 
as high as 60 cm H20 in conjunction with respiratory efforts 
against an obstructed upper airway, in contrast to pressures of 
approximately 5 cm H20 during quiet wakefulness.1 Thus, 
OSA may promote enuresis by increasing bladder pressure. 

Finally, SDB can affect the secretion of urinary hormones 
such as atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and antidiuretic 
hormone (ADH). 

Adults with OSAS have elevated ANP and decreased 
ADH,34-36 and the normal nocturnal decrease in urine output 
does not occur.35-37 In patients with OSA, plasma ANP correlates 
negatively with cumulative apnea duration and lowest 
SaO2 and positively with the highest change in intrathoracic 
pressure.34 This may be due to the more negative intrathoracic 
pressures increasing atrial volume, thus stimulating ANP production. 
Acute hypoxemia may result from central or obstructive 
respiratory events and may stimulate ANP secretion.38 
Urine output, sodium excretion, and secretion of ANP all decrease 
while renin and aldosterone increase with successful 
treatment of OSA.34,36,37,39,40 

Our patient sample was referred for suspected SDB, and 
it is possible that nocturnal enuresis was a factor in the pri-

mary physicians’ decision to refer, thus inflating our reported 
prevalence of enuresis. Despite this, we believe that the association 
between nocturnal enuresis and OSAS is real, with a 
reasonable physiologic basis. Obstructive sleep apnea, which 
can usually be easily treated, should be considered in the differential 
diagnosis of nocturnal enuresis in children.
