Sleep disordered breathing and daytime quality 
of life in children with allergic rhinitis 
during treatment with intranasal budesonide

Background: Nasal obstruction is recognized as an important cause of sleep disordered breathing. Congestion of the nasal 
mucosa and obstruction are common symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Daytime sleepiness is a common finding in symptomatic 
allergic rhinitis. Effective therapy of the nasal congestion of allergic rhinitis should alter sleep patterns in patients with 
symptomatic allergic rhinitis. 

Objective: To measure objective changes in polysomnograms (sleep studies) of children with allergic rhinitis before and after 
therapy with intranasal budesonide and to measure changes in the quality of life of these patients during treatment. 

Methods: Open clinical trial with objective measurements (polysomnography) and subjective data (Rhinitis Quality of Life 
Questionnaire [RQLQ]). Evaluations were performed before, during, and at completion of therapeutic intervention. 

Results: The 14 studied children tolerated the procedures and treatment without problems. The mean number of sleep arousals 
per hour (all apneas and hypopneas) decreased from a baseline of 8.4 to 1.2 (P . 
.005) after treatment. The change was mainly 
in hypopneic episodes (7.5–0.9, P . 
.003). Objective responses on the RQLQ showed improvements consistent with improved 
sleep and lessened rhinitis symptoms. 

Conclusions: Decreasing the nasal congestion associated with allergic rhinitis can improve sleep measured by objective sleep 

studies and lead to improvement in daytime quality of life. 

INTRODUCTION 

Patients with symptomatic allergic rhinitis complain of daytime 
somnolence, fatigue, and decreased cognitive performance.
1 Sleep disordered breathing has been suggested as the 
reason for these symptoms.2 The proposed mechanism is nocturnal 
nasal congestion that causes increased nasal airway resistance. 
Either overcoming this increased nasal resistance or 
mouth breathing while asleep requires a greater negative pressure 
during inspiration, which leads to pharyngeal collapse and 
obstruction. The subsequent obstruction and cessation of respiration 
can be partial (hypopnea) or complete (apnea). 

A series of studies has evaluated respiration during sleep 
with artificially induced nasal obstruction. Zwillich et al3 evaluated 
10 adult men with initial normal sleep breathing patterns. 
They used bilateral balloon catheters to obstruct the nose. Nine 
of the 10 subjects showed increased sleep apneas and hypopneas 
during the nasal obstruction study. Four subjects, when obstructed, 
experienced 60 or more apnea/hypopnea episodes. The 
next day, they complained of morning fatigue. 

In a similar study, Olsen et al4 reported that 3 of 8 subjects 
with normal baseline sleep study results had more than 60 
apnea/hypopnea episodes during sleep with both nares obstructed.

results, Olsen et al found that these patients spent more time 
in stage 1 sleep. Lavie et al5 studied 10 healthy young adults 
(5 men and 5 women). Compared with baseline sleep study 
results, unilateral nasal obstruction significantly increased 
hypopneic episodes. In the same subjects, bilateral nasal 
obstruction caused an even larger number of sleep arousals. 
Overall, approximately one third of subjects with induced 
nasal obstruction develop sleep patterns characteristic of 
mild-to-moderate sleep apnea.6 

Sleep disordered breathing occurs in both children and 
adults. A significant role for enlarged tonsils and adenoids, 
causing airway obstruction in some children, is supported by 
improvement in sleep study results after surgery.7 Intranasal 
corticosteroids have also been reported to improve sleep disordered 
breathing in children with enlarged tonsils and adenoids.8 

Lavie et al9 compared sleep study results in 14 young 
adults with symptomatic allergic rhinitis to 7 healthy controls. 
The allergic rhinitis subjects averaged approximately 50 
microarousals during the sleep period compared with approximately 
4 in the control group. 

McNicholas et al10 evaluated sleep in 7 subjects with seasonal 
allergic rhinitis when they were symptomatic and also out of 
season when they were asymptomatic. These patients had abnormal 
sleep study results during the season with multiple arousals, 
which diminished in the out-of-season study. 

Intranasal corticosteroids are recognized as an effective 
treatment for allergic rhinitis. They have been shown to 
decrease the symptoms of nasal congestion.11 Therefore, it

seems reasonable that their use could benefit sleep disordered 
breathing associated with allergic rhinitis. This preliminary 
study evaluates the effects of intranasal steroid on sleep 
patterns and quality of life in children with active allergic 
rhinitis and histories suggestive of sleep disturbance. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

The volunteers were 14 prepubescent children (6 females, 8 
males) with a mean age of 5.9 years (range, 4 –9 years). By 
history, all had perennial allergic rhinitis with seasonal exacerbations, 
which is typical for our region. One child had mild 
persistent asthma. Rhinitis signs and symptoms were present 
for at least 2 years. Twelve of 14 had never used intranasal 
corticosteroids; 2 had not used them for at least 3 months 
before the study. Children with moderate or severe asthma or 
significant atopic dermatitis were excluded, as were children 
taking any medications that could affect allergic rhinitis or 
medicines with potential central nervous system effects. Additional 
exclusions included any other significant chronic 
disease. Some of the symptoms described by the parents were 
snoring, being difficult to awaken, or being sleepy during the 
day. All had physical examination results compatible with 
allergic rhinitis. Each had an allergy skin prick test result 
positive to relevant airborne allergens for the time of their 
participation in the study. Allergy prick skin testing using duo 
tip applicators was performed with extracts from Center 
Laboratories (Port Washington, NY). They were either standardized 
(Bermuda, timothy, cat) or traditional 1/20 (wt/vol) 
in 50% glycerin (alfalfa, Johnson, cottonwood, mulberry, 
mesquite, pecan, willow, cypress, pigweed, Russian thistle, 
ragweed, greasewood, iodine bush, dog). Histamine diphosphate, 
2.75 mg/ml, was used as the positive control. Glycerosaline 
served as the negative control. A wheal of 3 mm 
greater than the negative control was considered positive. 

Airborne allergen counts have been taken 5 of 7 days for 
the past 12 years at our center with a Rotorod sampler. These 
counts were used to determine that relevant allergens would 
be present during the study period for each subject. 

At the baseline visit, a parent signed the informed consent 
and the study was explained to the children in simple terms. 
The diagnosis of allergic rhinitis was confirmed by the medical 
history, physical examination, and skin testing. A parent 
(always, by chance, the mother) completed the Rhinitis Quality 
of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) along with the child. 

Arrangements were made for overnight polysomnography 
to be performed in the child’s home. The day following the 
polysomnographic study, the child began use of intranasal 
budesonide metered-dose inhaler, 64 g, in each nostril in the 
morning. The parent and child were carefully instructed on 
the proper use of the nasal inhaler. The parent or child with 
the parent’s supervision administered the medicine. The child 
and mother returned at 2, 4, and 6 weeks after beginning 
therapy. At each visit, the child was examined. The mother 
and child completed the RQLQ. 

After week 6, the sleep study was performed again. The 
child continued to use the intranasal budesonide until the 

second polysomnography was completed. The RQLQ scale 
ranged from 0, which means none or not at all, to 9, which 
means totally or completely disturbed, depending on the 
question. Higher scores reflect more disease symptoms or 
impact of the disease. 

Obstructive breathing events were classified as complete 
(apneas) or partial (hypopneas). Hypopneic events involved a 
50% or greater reduction in respiratory flow, lasting for more 
than 10 seconds. Central apneas were cessations of breathing 
without any obstruction. 

Statistical analysis for the paired sleep studies was performed 
by t testing or the Wilcoxon signed rank test when the 
data were not distributed in a normal fashion. The scores of 
the RQLQ were analyzed with repeated-measures analysis of 
variance. Differences between the baseline week and week 6 
were analyzed by t testing of means. The study was approved 
by the Institutional Review Board of Las Palmas Medical 
Center, El Paso, TX. 

RESULTS 

In the study group, there were no adverse experiences related 
to the therapy with intranasal budesonide. The longest use of 
budesonide between sleep studies was 6 weeks 5 days. The 
frequency of reported symptoms in the children were as 
follows: snoring, 80%; difficulty in awakening, 80%; restless 
sleep, 90%; daytime sleepiness, 70%; and irritability, 70%. 
Seventy percent of the households had a cat, dog, or both. 

On physical examinations, the children had characteristic 
congested, bluish nasal mucosa. All had allergic shiners. 
Other common findings were dry cracked lips, coated 
tongues, and prominent tonsils. No attempt was made to 
grade tonsillar hypertrophy, but none of the children had 
tonsils that completely obstructed the oropharynx. During the 
study period, the physical signs of dried lips and coated 
tongues decreased. Nasal congestion was not evaluated in a 
manner that could objectively be analyzed. 

The dates of each child’s participation and the relevant 
allergens to which they were sensitized are shown in Table 1. 
The sleep studies improved as shown in Table 2. There was 
a decrease in the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI; obstructive 
apnea and hypopneas per hour) from 7.6 to 0.9 (P . 
.004). 
The respiratory disturbance index (RDI; central apneas plus 
obstructive apneas plus hypopneas per hour) changed from 

8.4 to 1.2 (P . 
.005). These changes in AHI and RDI were 
mainly due to changes in the rates of hypopneas per hour 
(7.5–0.9, P . 
.003). The mean duration of the hypopneic 
episodes decreased from 16.9 to 10.8 seconds (P . 
.05). 
Other measurements changed in the direction favoring an 
improved sleep pattern but were not always significant. In 
some cases, there were simply not enough events in the 
baseline sleep studies to demonstrate such change. 
The responses on the RQLQ showed significantly decreased 
nasal symptoms with treatment (Fig 1). The scores 
relating to the sleep disturbance and its consequences (Fig. 2) 
improved significantly. Last, thirst, which we believed was 
influenced by oral breathing, decreased (P . 
.001) along with

DISCUSSION 

This was an open treatment clinical trial in children. We are 
aware that results of randomized, placebo-controlled study 
would be more compelling. However, the resources available 
to us made this clinical trial the only realistic way for us to 
address the questions. The real weakness of the design is the 
proof that the therapy made a difference. In our study population, 
all the children were exposed to relevant aeroallergens 
during their study time. We have no reason to suspect the 
marked improvement in rhinitis symptoms was spontaneous. 
We believe our findings support the role of allergic rhinitis in

ings are valid. Improvement in rhinitis symptoms was associated 
with subjective improvement in the sleep domains and 
the sleep studies. Our findings are not unexpected but contribute 
to the present body of knowledge concerning sleep 
disturbance in allergic rhinitis. 

Two of the studies previously cited are important to understand 
our results. The study by McNicholas et al10 showed 
that adult volunteers with symptomatic allergic rhinitis had 
increased sleep arousals, which tended to normalize when the 
subjects were asymptomatic. However, the magnitude of 
change in our study exceeded those in the aforementioned 
study, possibly reflecting a therapeutic effect of the intranasal 
steroids, not simply a change in allergen exposure. 

In the study that involved the use of intranasal fluticasone 
to treat a group of children with enlarged tonsils and adenoids 
and sleep disordered breathing, the children treated with fluticasone 
had improved sleep breathing patterns, but the children 
who used the placebo vehicle remained the same or worsened.8 
The investigators were not able to document changes in tonsillar 
or adenoidal size during therapy, even though the treated children’s 
sleep studies improved. There was no description of the 
allergic status of the children in the article. 

A recent report by Craig et al12 evaluated the use of 
intranasal fluticasone in adult patients with perennial allergic 
rhinitis and a history suggestive of sleep disturbance. They 
measured the effects of active treatment and placebo on sleep 
polysomnography, RQLQ, and the Epworth sleepiness scale. 
Although they found evidence of improvement in daytime 
drowsiness, they could not document changes in the overnight 
sleep studies. However, all trends favored the active 
treatment compared with placebo. It is possible that the fact 
that our children had a higher mean AHI than the subjects 
studied by Craig et al made it easier for us to demonstrate an 
objective change in sleep disordered breathing.12 

The home monitoring of sleep disordered breathing has 
been reported to have little variability on multiple testings.12 
We do not think the large changes observed in the study can 
be attributed to technical issues. 

A number of investigators have reported changes in daytime 
measures of sleepiness, such as the Epworth Sleep Scale, 

after successful treatment of allergic rhinitis.13,14 Improvement 
in the domains of the RQLQ has also been noted.15,16 
This is in accord with the subjective evaluations of the 
mothers and children in our study. 

Children with allergic rhinitis are at least 3 times as likely 
to have disturbed sleep as the general pediatric population.17 
The children whom we studied clearly had different sleep 
studies than expected in the healthy pediatric population. 
They were selected on the basis of having allergic rhinitis and 
a history suggestive of disturbed sleep. In healthy children, 
central apneas appear to be common.18 However, obstructive 
apneas are uncommon.19 Healthy children rarely have full 
obstructive apneas, and their RDI has been reported as 1.1.20 
A normal frequency for hypopneas in children has not been 
published but would be less than the RDI (central apneas, 
obstructive apneas, and hypopneas per hour). An RDI of 5 or 
more unaccompanied by oxygen desaturation during children’s 
sleep studies was associated with approximately a 
2-fold risk for snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness with 
an almost 4-fold risk for learning problems.21 

Given the high prevalence of allergic rhinitis in the pediatric 
population, a large number of children are likely experiencing 
unrecognized sleep disturbance syndrome on this 
basis. In none of our study subjects was the problem of 
disordered sleep previously addressed by the primary care 
providers of the children. 

The pediatric manifestations of sleep disordered breathing 
may include behavior comparable to attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder. It is not unreasonable to speculate that 
central nervous system stimulants may work in these children 
often diagnosed as having attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder 
because of their usual pharmacologic actions.22 The 
reported increase in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder 
frequency is occurring at a time when a potential cause of 
pediatric sleep disturbance, allergic rhinitis, is also becoming 
more prevalent. More work is required to evaluate the possible 
relationship and its importance. 

CONCLUSION 

We have demonstrated that during treatment of children 
with allergic rhinitis with an intranasal corticosteroid (budesonide), 
nasal symptoms decreased, objective sleep studies 
improved, and subjective symptoms relating to poor quality 
of sleep diminished. We expect that these findings will be 
replicated when the study is performed in a randomized, 
placebo-controlled fashion.
