Although sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) is common, 
studies assessing the anesthetic management of these 
patients are rare and consist mainly of case studies. 
We performed a retrospective case-control study to 
determine the incidence of difficult intubation in SAS 
patients and to determine the relationship between 
the severity of SAS and the occurrence of difficult intubation. 
Among 113 patients included (36 and 77 in 
the SAS and control groups, respectively), difficult 

intubation occurred more often in SAS patients than 
in controls (21.9% versus 2.6%, respectively; P . 
0.05). No relationship was found between the severity 
of SAS and the occurrence of difficult intubation. 
Disappointingly, no single factor was associated with 
the occurrence of difficult intubation in SAS patients. 
We conclude that SAS is a risk factor for difficult 
intubation.

wo percent of women and 4% of men in the 
middle-aged US workforce meet the minimal diagnostic 
criteria for sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) 
(1). Because 93% of women and 82% of men with 
moderate to severe SAS have not been previously 
diagnosed (2), many patients with undiagnosed SAS 
undergo general or regional anesthesia. Nevertheless, 
SAS studies that concern anesthesia are rare (3) and 
consist mainly of case studies (4,5). One of the important 
issues of anesthesia management in patients with 
SAS is control of the upper airway. The concept of 
difficult endotracheal intubation in these patients is 
mostly derived from assumptions of anesthesia experts 
(6,7) and from case studies (8). Hiremath et al. (9) 
found a high prevalence of SAS in patients with difficult 
intubation. Gentil et al. (10) studied a small 
group of 18 patients undergoing ear, nose, and throat 
(ENT) surgery and found a (9) frequent percentage of 
difficult intubation (44%) in patients with SAS but also 
a high prevalence of difficult intubation in the control 
group. Moreover, the disease severity and the associated 
diseases were not mentioned. Although there are 
good theoretical grounds to suspect an association 
between the severity of SAS and the occurrence of 
difficult intubation, this remains speculative (11). 
Thus, we designed this retrospective case-control

study to assess the incidence of difficult intubation in 
SAS patients, to assess the relationship between difficult 
intubation and the severity of SAS, and to search 
for any factor associated with difficult intubation in 
patients with SAS. 

Methods 

This retrospective study took place in a university 
teaching hospital between April 1999 and July 2001. 
All patients with a polysomnography-confirmed diagnosis 
of SAS who were undergoing surgery under 
general anesthesia were included in the study after 
approval by the Scientific Committee on Human 
Studies. SAS severity was measured by the apneahypopnea 
index (AHI), defined as the number of 
apnea and hypopnea events per hour of sleep, and 
the lowest oxygen saturation associated with an 
abnormal respiratory event during sleep (LSAT). 
For each SAS patient, the next two (or three when 
possible) control patients from the same week’s list 
were included in the study if they had the same sex, 
similar age (10 yr), and were assigned to the same 
type of surgery. Patients were divided into two types of 
surgery: ENT and non-ENT surgery. Patients having any 
of following criteria were excluded: history of snoring, 
without a diagnostic polysomnography examination; 
age 16 yr; emergency surgery; and history of a predicted 
difficult intubation for other causes (temporomandibular 
joint malformation, laryngeal tumor or 
maxillary/mandibular injury in trauma patients). All

patients who were not receiving general anesthesia with 
tracheal intubation were also excluded. 

The two groups were compared for factors previously 
described as having an important relationship 
with SAS in the perioperative period (7). These factors 
included a history of smoking or excessive alcohol 
intake; history of previous tracheal intubation; history 
of arterial hypertension, right heart failure, pulmonary 
artery hypertension, cardiac arrhythmia, or coronary 
artery disease; and history of diabetes mellitus, depression, 
or gastroesophageal reflux. Preoperative hemoglobin 
(Hb) values were also compared. Difficult 
intubation was anticipated when the preanesthetic assessment 
performed by the anesthesiologist confirmed 
that the patient had a Grade III or IV Mallampati 
classification as modified by Samsoon and Young (12). 
Other risk factors of difficult intubation, such as neck 
extension, thyromental distance, and mouth opening, 
were also assessed. Difficult intubation was assessed 
by the anesthesiologist during laryngoscopy by using 
the Cormack and Lehane classification (13) and was 
defined as Grade III or IV, as well as the possibility of 
postextubation obstruction of the upper airway. Data 
pertaining to the stay in the postanesthesia care unit 
(PACU) were recorded: oxygen saturation on arrival, 
the minimal oxygen saturation, the need for morphine, 
the respiratory treatment applied (oxygen supplementation, 
nasal continuous positive airway pressure, 
and tracheal intubation), the length of stay in the 
PACU, and the occurrence of complications. 

The sample size was calculated postulating that difficult 
intubation may occur in up to 1% of general-
surgery patients (including ENT surgery) and in 20% 
of SAS patients. Considering a one-sided test with . 
at 

0.05 and . 
at 0.2, 32 patients were necessary to show a 
significant difference between SAS and control patients 
(http://www.statistics.com). 
Data are presented as mean . 
sd or percentage 
when needed. Student’s t-tests, the Mann-Whitney 
U-test, and the 2 test were used to compare the two 
groups. P . 
0.05 was defined as statistically significant. 

Results 

Among 113 patients (12 women and 101 men) included, 
36 and 77 patients were in the SAS and control 
groups, respectively. Three women and 33 men with 
SAS were included. Age varied from 16 to 82 yr. The 
general characteristics of the two groups are shown in 
Table 1. The AHI was 41.7 . 
22.1, and LSAT was 
65.9% . 
18.1%. SAS surgery included bilateral turbinectomy, 
tonsillectomy, septoplasty, and uvulopalatopharyngoplasty. 
These procedures were often combined. 
In the preoperative period, no significant 
difference was found between the two groups for 
history of smoking, excessive alcohol intake, or previous 
tracheal intubation. Control group patients were 

SIYAM AND BENHAMOU 1099 
SLEEP APNEA AND ANESTHESIA 

more often classified as ASA status I than SAS patients. 
Arterial hypertension was more frequently encountered 
in SAS patients than in controls. Moreover, 
although this was not statistically significant, patients 
with SAS more frequently had right heart failure, coronary 
artery disease, and pulmonary artery hypertension 
and were more likely to have cardiac arrhythmias. 
Also, preoperative Hb values were significantly 
higher in SAS compared with control patients. Difficult 
intubation was more often anticipated and occurred 
more often in SAS patients compared with 
controls (Table 2, Figs. 1 and 2). The incidence of 
difficult intubation was not more frequent in patients 
operated on for SAS than in SAS patients undergoing 
surgery unrelated to SAS (18% versus 30%, respectively; 
not significant). For all patients, the anticipation 
of difficult intubation was significantly related to 
weight, body mass index (BMI), and difficult intubation 
(Table 3). This was not true in SAS patients. In 
SAS patients in whom difficult intubation was found, 
modified Mallampati class, BMI, AHI, and LSAT were 
not different from values obtained in SAS patients 
who underwent easy intubation (Table 4). This was 
also true for risk factors of difficult intubation (data 
not mentioned). In the PACU, oxygen saturation on 
arrival and morphine consumption were not different 
between the two groups (Table 2). However, in SAS 
patients the lowest arterial oxygen saturation was 
lower than in controls. SAS patients required respiratory 
treatment more often than control patients. SAS 
patients had more complications than control patients. 
All complications (mainly hypertension-related bleeding 
at the surgical site) occurred in the first hours of 
their PACU stay. Nevertheless, no life-threatening 
complication was noted. 

Discussion 

This study has mainly shown that, when compared 
with patients matched for sex, age, and surgery, patients 
with SAS exhibit preoperative cardiac disease 
more often and present with a more frequent incidence 
of difficult intubation and with postoperative 
oxygen desaturation in their PACU stay, requiring 
oxygen. Interpretation of these significant differences 
must be tempered by the retrospective nature of the 
analysis. 

Many studies have demonstrated the relationship 
between arterial hypertension and the AHI (14,15). It 
is thus not surprising that, in our SAS patients, arterial 
hypertension was more prevalent than in control patients. 
Although the prevalence of arterial hypertension 
in our patients was slightly more frequent than in 
a standard SAS population (20%–40%) (15), this was 
related to a high AHI. Also, the prevalence of arterial 
hypertension was more frequent in the control group

than in a similar population (3%–5%) (15). Many studies 
have also shown that patients with SAS are more 
likely to present with diabetes mellitus (16), depression 
(17), or gastroesophageal reflux (18). It is thus not 
surprising that only 33% of our SAS group had none 
of these diseases and that only 22% of patients with 
SAS were classified as ASA status I. Because apnea-
induced hypoxemia during sleep stimulates erythropoietin 
production from the kidneys (7), Hb values 
were more than in control patients. 

The prevalence of difficult intubation in our control 
group was more frequent than in a standard population. 
This is probably related to the large percentage of 
ENT surgery. Hiremath et al. (9) found that in 8 of 
their 15 patients with difficult intubation, SAS was 
diagnosed. The relationship between difficult intubation 
and SAS was strong enough to make the authors 
believe that “All patients who have a trachea that is 
difficult to intubate should be regarded as having SAS 

until excluded by clinical features and, where doubt 
exists, sleep studies.” All patients with SAS should be 
regarded as having a high risk of difficult intubation. 
Several factors account for this increased risk. Obesity 
is significantly related to difficult intubation (19,20), 
and SAS patients present with a significantly greater 
BMI. Diabetes mellitus also increases the risk of difficult 
intubation (21) and is more frequently encountered 
in SAS patients. Finally, SAS patients frequently 
present with abnormal facial and upper airway morphology 
(retrognathia, short and thick neck, large 
tongue) well known to be associated with an increased 
risk of difficult intubation. In the letter of Gentil et al. 
(10), 18 patients operated for SAS were studied. The 
authors did not mention the associated diseases found 
in their patients and did not study the relationship 
between difficult intubation and the severity of SAS. 
Moreover, patients operated on for conditions unrelated 
to SAS were not included. Obese SAS patients

often have an excess of pharyngeal tissue deposited 
mainly in the pharyngeal lateral walls. Theoretically, 
the larger the amount of pharyngeal tissue, the higher 
the AHI and the lesser the LSAT, and thus the greater 
modified Mallampati and Cormack and Lehane 
scores. There was, however, no clear relationship 
among BMI, AHI, LSAT, modified Mallampati score, 
or Cormack and Lehane score in this study. Moreover, 
we found that patients operated on for SAS did not 
present an increased risk of difficult intubation when 
compared with those with SAS operated on for unrelated 
indications. We also demonstrated that the severity 
of the underlying disease is not correlated with 
a proportionately increased risk of difficult intubation. 
SAS thus appears to be a factor for difficult intubation. 
It is disappointing that no preoperative factor obtained 
in a routine preoperative assessment was associated 
with difficult intubation in patients with SAS. 
Further studies are needed to explore this issue.

In the postoperative period, patients with SAS spent 
more time in the PACU than did controls. This can be 
explained by our hospital policy to maintain SAS patients 
in PACU for one night, especially if they need 
opioids for postoperative analgesia, although this is 
controversial, with several authors questioning the 
usefulness of systematic admission of SAS patients for 
the first postoperative night in the PACU (22–24). This 
policy is supported by the fact that oxygen desaturation 
occurs more frequently in the postoperative period 
in SAS patients, and 97% of our SAS patients 
required respiratory treatment in the first night after 
surgery. More complications occurred in our SAS 
group, although life-threatening complications were 
not seen. Several authors have mentioned that the risk 
of upper airway obstruction after extubation is increased 
in SAS patients (25), especially after uvulopalatopharyngoplasty 
surgery (26). However, no patient

in this study experienced postextubation obstruction of 
upper airway. Further studies are needed to determine 
the postoperative management of SAS patients. Our 
study also emphasizes how important it is to maintain 
arterial blood pressure in the normal range in SAS patients 
(22), because a significant proportion of immediate 
postoperative complications were arterial hypertension-
related hemorrhage. 

In conclusion, our study demonstrated that SAS is a 
factor for difficult intubation. The associated diseases 
often seen in these patients require careful attention in 
the perioperative period.
