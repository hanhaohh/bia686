Abstract 

Objective: To assess the prevalence of cardiac failure in a group of children with suspected obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) 
and to assess the need for preoperative electrocardiograms (ECGs) and chest radiographs (CXRs) in children with OSA. 


Design: Case record review of 271 children having (adeno)tonsillectomy for symptoms of OSA. 
Method: Preoperative ECGs and CXRs were assessed for signs of right atrial or ventricular hypertrophy or failure. Case 
records were assessed for evidence of cardiac failure during anaesthesia. 


Results: One child with congenital heart disease had signs of cardiac failure preoperatively. No other cases of atrial or ven


tricular hypertrophy or failure were found. 
Conclusions: Cardiac failure appears to be uncommon in children with symptoms of OSA. Preoperative ECG and CXR are 
essential in only selected cases.

sleep apnea (OSA). When disruption of sleep is severe 
enough, this causes daytime hypersomnolence and 
other related symptoms. On occasion, the physiologic 
strain of severe OSA is associated with right-sided 
heart failure. Consequently, OSA has become an 
important indication for adenotonsillectomy.1 

The association with right-sided heart failure was 
first demonstrated in a child in 1965.2 Characteristic 
abnormalities on chest radiography (CXR) and electrocardiography 
(ECG) were confirmed by cardiac 
catheterization. These abnormalities return to normal 
after relief of the obstruction by adenotonsillectomy. 
Similar cases were, and continue to be, reported.3–6 
Death from cardiovascular collapse has occurred during 
induction of anaesthesia in childhood OSA, and, as 
a consequence, it has been recommended that cardiac 
function is investigated with preoperative ECG.7

Although snoring occurs in 11 to 27% of normal 
children,8,9 paediatric OSA is estimated to occur in 
only 0.7% of the normal population.10 It is difficult to 
determine an exact prevalence, partly because there is 
no widely accepted definition of OSA in children.11 
Sleep studies quantify the spectrum from snoring to 
hypopnea to apnea, but unlike adult OSA, in which the 
apnea index is widely used,12 there is no consensus on 
the number and duration of apneas that must occur to 
make the diagnosis of OSA in children.11,13–15 There is 
debate on whether a sleep study is needed to diagnose 
the condition and on what parameters should be measured 
in a sleep study. In addition, there are few normative 
data from sleep studies on healthy children with 
which to compare results.14,16 Many otolaryngologists 
rely entirely on a history of apneic episodes observed 
by the parents to make the diagnosis.1,17 

Similarly, there is no clear indication from the literature 
on the prevalence of cardiovascular abnormalities 
in paediatric OSA. One study of 92 children who 
were undergoing adenotonsillectomy for any indication 
identified signs of pulmonary hypertension in 2%.7 It 
might be expected that children with episodes of OSA 
have a higher prevalence and that children with severe 
OSA would be at the greatest risk. 

This study investigates a group of children undergoing 
excision of tonsils and/or adenoids for sleep disturbance 
with symptoms suggestive of OSA. It aims to 
assess the prevalence of cardiovascular abnormalities in 
these children as shown by features of right atrial 
hypertrophy (RAH) or right ventricular hypertrophy 
(RVH) on preoperative ECG and CXR. The requirement 
for these preoperative investigations in paediatric 
OSA is reviewed. 

Method 

A review was made of the notes of 271 cases of children 
under the age of 17 years undergoing surgery for OSA at 
the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, UK. Diagnosis of OSA 
was based on a parental description of cessation of airflow 
with continued respiratory effort. Sleep studies 
were not performed routinely. Patients were identified 
from the otolaryngology theatre database in which 
details including diagnosis and operation are recorded. 
The hospital record of each was searched to confirm a 
description of OSA by an otolaryngologist in the clinic 
note, letter to general practitioner, or admission clerking. 
The anaesthetic record was checked for any abnormal 
intraoperative cardiac event. Departmental policy 
recommended routine preoperative ECG and CXR in 
suspected OSA, so when it was present, the ECG was 
photocopied for subsequent analysis and the CXR 
report was recorded. A search of the Radiology Department 
database was made to identify cases in which CXR 
reports had not been filed in the records. The ECG was 

evaluated for signs of RAH or RVH by age, according to 
the criteria of Park and Gunteroth.18 RAH causes a 
peaked P wave in lead II. The features of RVH are given 
in Table 1. Those found to have any parameters outside 
the normal range and a random selection of 50 of the 
remainder were independently and blindly assessed by a 
paediatric cardiologist (M.R.). All CXR reports were 
produced by a radiology consultant or registrar. 

Results 

The median age of the 271 cases reviewed was 4 years. 
Only one child was less than 1 year old, and the maximum 
age was 14 years (Figure 1). The condition was 
more common in males (sex ratio 5:3). An ECG was 
available in 157 (58%) and a CXR in 111 (41%). Both 
investigations were present in 95 cases (35%), and neither 
was present in 98 cases (36%). 

There were no cases in which ECG revealed RAH, 
but there was one case of mild RVH in a 17-month-old 
child whose CXR was normal and the anaesthetic 
uneventful. The parents described severe apneic 
episodes, and a history of mitral and tricuspid valve 
incompetence led to a sleep study, which recorded oxygen 
desaturations below 50%. 

One case of right axis deviation and two cases of 
left axis deviation were found but without any other 
ECG or clinical abnormalities. All other ECGs were 
within normal limits (Table 2). 

A prominent pulmonary artery was suspected on 
the CXR of one 4-year-old child, but the ECG was normal, 
and no clinical or anaesthetic abnormalities were 
noted. No other CXRs showed any sign of cardiac failure 
or hypertrophy. 

No patient showed signs of cardiac failure during 
anaesthesia. 

Discussion 

Since right-sided heart failure was first described as 
a complication of childhood OSA over 25 years ago, 
isolated severe cases have been reported, which have 
occasionally been associated with intraoperative mortality.
3–7,19–21 Although such cases are uncommon, it

has been estimated that asymptomatic RVH can be 
detected in 3% of ECGs in children undergoing adenotonsillectomy.
7 However, that may be an overestimate 
of the prevalence of RVH as less reliable data were 
then available on normal values in paediatric ECG. The 
study was based on children who were undergoing adenoidectomy 
and/or tonsillectomy for any indication, so 
it included children without any obstructive symptoms. 
Such a group would be expected to show a lower rate 
of RVH than a group of OSA children; indeed, a prevalence 
of 20% RVH has been quoted in one group of 
children with OSA.22 Using the specific criteria of Park 
and Gunteroth for diagnosing RVH,18 we found only 
one case of mild RVH (1/197; 0.5%). This child had 
preexisting congenital cardiorespiratory anomalies. 
Three cases of isolated axis deviation were found but 
are not considered significant findings in the absence of 
other ECG abnormalities. There were no radiographic 
findings of RVH or RAH or any anaesthetic complication 
consistent with cardiac failure. 

Our group of patients consisted of children who had 
obstructive symptoms during sleep and were undergoing 
(adeno)tonsillectomy. This group might be expected to 
include children with mild OSA and milder obstructive 
sleep disturbance and therefore fewer cases of RVH than 
a group diagnosed by polysomnography. The definition 
of paediatric OSA is controversial. A history of no airflow 
despite inspiratory effort is the minimum requirement, 
and a parental description suggestive of apnea, as 
used in this study, is considered adequate in many centres.
1,17,23 It has been shown that clinical history alone 
has a low predictive value for OSA compared with full 
polysomnography15,24 when polysomnographic criteria 
are used to define OSA. Although polysomnography is 
often referred to as the “gold standard” investigation for 
OSA,25 in-patient sleep studies are not necessarily representative 
of a child’s usual sleeping behaviour.26 It is 

claimed that polysomnography is neither readily available 
nor cost effective.27 Thus, although a sleep study 
can help in confirmation of the diagnosis, adenotonsillectomy 
is commonly performed on the basis of obstructive 
and secondary symptoms alone. Our study shows 
that in such patients, RVH is uncommon. It is conceivable 
that the prevalence of RVH may be higher in other 
populations, for example, where children present with a 
longer history of OSA. 

Before this review, our departmental policy was to 
screen for right ventricular failure in all children with 
suspected OSA using CXR and ECG to detect RVH or 
RAH. These results suggest that such a policy is no 
longer necessary as right-sided hypertrophy is less common 
than previously supposed. To our knowledge, 
there are no reports of severe cases of right ventricular 
failure being identified by ECG/CXR screening alone. 
The rare cases of severe failure described in the literature 
were detected at presentation either by their 
unusually severe obstruction or by clinical features of 
cardiac failure. Full cardiologic investigation should 
still be performed in such cases to help minimize anaesthetic 
risk.6,28 

The policy of treating adult OSA has been questioned 
following evidence suggesting lower cardiac 
morbidity than previously thought.29 However, the

benefits of treatment on quality of life and cognitive 
performance continue to justify intervention.30 The 
finding that the risk of cardiac complications in childhood 
OSA is low does not remove the need for surgical 
management. Disturbed sleep patterns are well known 
to cause other problems, including failure to thrive, 
behavioural disorders, educational and developmental 
delay, and enuresis.31,32 These, too, have been shown to 
improve following adenotonsillectomy for OSA.33 

In conclusion, we have found a low rate of RVH in 
children with clinically suspected OSA. Although it is 
necessary to be alert to the possibility of cardiac complications 
in OSA, we do not feel that routine CXR 
and ECG are necessary in all children with obstructive 
symptoms. Review of other reports shows that full cardiac 
assessment is appropriate in selected cases, especially 
in children with severe symptoms of apnea or 
cardiac failure.
