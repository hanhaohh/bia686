ABSTRACT. Objective. Obstructive sleep apnea 
(OSA) in children is usually effectively treated by adenotonsillectomy 
(T&A). However, there may be a waiting 
list for T&A, and the procedure is associated with an 
increased risk of postoperative complications in children 
with OSA. Needed is a simple test that will facilitate 
logical prioritization of the T&A surgical list and help to 
predict children who are at highest risk of postoperative 
complications. The objective of this study was to develop 
and validate a severity scoring system for overnight 
oximetry and to evaluate the score as a tool to prioritize 
the T&A surgical list. 

Methods. This study comprised 3 phases. In phase 1, 
a severity score was developed by review of preoperative 
overnight oximetry in children who had urgent T&A in 
1999–2000. In phase 2, the score was validated retrospectively 
in 155 children who had polysomnography (PSG) 
before T&A in 1992–1998. In a phase 3, a 12-month prospective 
evaluation of a protocol based on the score was 
conducted. 

Results. In phase 1, a 4-level severity score was developed 
on the basis of the number and the depth of 
desaturation events (normal to severely abnormal, categories 
1–4). In phase 2, the McGill oximetry score correlated 
with severity of OSA by PSG criteria. In phase 3, a 
clinical management protocol was developed based on 
the score. Of 230 children tested, 179 (78%) had a normal/ 
inconclusive oximetry (category 1) and went on to have 
PSG. Those with a positive oximetry (categories 2–4; 
22%) had no additional sleep studies before T&A. Timing 
of T&A was based on oximetry score, leading to a 
significant reduction in waiting time for surgery for 
those with higher oximetry scores. Postoperative respiratory 
complications were more common with increasing 
oximetry score. 

Conclusions. Overnight pulse oximetry can be used 
to estimate the severity of OSA, to shorten the diagnostic 
and treatment process for those with more severe disease, 
and to aid clinicians in prioritization of T&A and planning 
perioperative care. Pediatrics 2004;113:e19–e25.

bstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common 
condition in childhood, affecting approximately 
1% to 3% of children.1,2 The morbidity 
associated with OSA includes sleep disruption, failure 
to thrive, and cor pulmonale.3 In addition, potential 
neuropsychological and cognitive consequences 
are being increasingly recognized, including 
lower academic performance4,5 and higher rates of 
behavioral problems,6 when compared with unaffected 
children of the same age. Most otherwise normal 
children with OSA have adenotonsillar enlargement, 
and adenotonsillectomy (T&A) is usually a 
highly effective treatment.7,8 

Approximately 6% to 12% of healthy children have 
habitual snoring.1,2,9 In this group, clinical history 
and examination findings fail to distinguish clinically 
significant OSA from benign snoring (snoring 
without impairment of oxygenation or ventilation 
and without sleep disruption).10 Polysomnography 
(PSG), involving an overnight stay in a sleep laboratory, 
provides a detailed evaluation of both sleep 
quality and breathing during sleep11 and is currently 
the best method available for diagnosis of OSA.12 
However, in many centers, such an evaluation either 
is not available or involves a considerable waiting 
time. In addition, waiting lists for T&A may be long 
and clinicians must prioritize cases for surgery. For 
these reasons, alternatives to full PSG for the evaluation 
of suspected OSA are often sought.13 

Periodic clusters of desaturation on continuous 
overnight recording of oxygen saturation with 3 or 
more desaturations 90% has been demonstrated to 
have a 97% positive predictive value for OSA in 
otherwise healthy children.14 Since September 2000, 
children without other medical problems and with a 
history strongly suggestive of OSA plus a positive 
overnight oximetry14 have been referred directly for 
T&A in our center, without proceeding to a more 
detailed sleep study. It had been our practice to 
expedite T&A in children with more severe desaturation 
during sleep, rather than have these children 
wait on the surgical waiting list. This practice was 
based on experimental evidence of the effects of severe 
intermittent hypoxia on the developing brain15 
and on our disquiet in waiting several months for

definitive treatment in young children with severe 
episodic desaturation. To formalize this prioritization 
process, we set out to develop a scoring system 
for overnight oximetry that is easily applied; reflects 
the severity of the underlying OSA; and can be used 
by pediatricians, sleep physicians, respiratory physicians, 
anesthesiologists, and otolaryngologists to prioritize 
patients who require T&A. This article presents 
the development of such a score and its 
validation and a prospective evaluation of a clinical 
management protocol based on the score. 

METHODS 

Development and evaluation of a severity scoring system for 
overnight oximetry was undertaken in 3 phases: 1) development 
of the criteria for the score; 2) comparison of the score with 
polysomnographic markers of OSA severity; and 3) prospective 
evaluation of a clinical management protocol based on the score, 
to determine whether use of the score had the desired effect of 
expediting surgical treatment for those with more severe OSA. 

Phase 1: Development of the Oximetry Score 

The goal for phase 1 was to establish an easily implemented 
oximetry scoring system that reflected consensus opinion about 
what constitutes a mildly, moderately, or severely abnormal oximetry. 
Children who had T&A performed on the urgent operating 
list at the Montreal Children’s Hospital between January 1, 1999, 
and March 31, 2001, were identified from the operating room 
record. This group was chosen because it was an easily defined 
group that would be expected to include a number of children 
with severe OSA. T&A was being performed on an urgent basis 
because of a high level of clinical concern on the part of the 
treating physician and/or otolaryngologist.16 In cases in which 
continuous overnight oximetry had been performed preoperatively, 
the overnight oximetry trend and individual desaturation 
events were reviewed by 3 independent raters (G.M.N., G.M.D., 
and R.T.B.).14,17 Pulse oximetry was performed using either a 
Nellcor (Pleasanton, CA) N-200 (mode 2, fast averaging) or N-3000 
oximeter. Identifying features were removed from the records so 
that the raters were unaware of the child’s clinical details. Each 
evaluator ranked the tests in order of severity, and then the list 
was divided into the following groups, with the criteria for inclusion 
in each category being determined individually and independently 
by each rater: 1) normal or inconclusive oximetry recording,
14 and therefore not able to exclude OSA without additional 
evaluation of breathing during sleep; 2) mildly abnormal study, 
predictive of OSA14 necessitating T&A but not on an urgent basis; 
3) markedly abnormal study, with a pattern consistent with OSA, 
requiring surgery on an expedited basis (arbitrarily defined as 
within 2 weeks); and 4) severely abnormal study, with a pattern 
consistent with OSA, requiring surgery on an urgent basis (arbitrarily 
defined as within 1–2 days, with admission to hospital for 
stabilization before surgery). 

The list of rankings was then compared, and objective criteria 
were determined for each of the above categories, after discussion 
between the scorers. This step in the development of the score was 

undertaken to determine the level of agreement between experienced 
observers of overnight oximetry as to what constitutes an 
abnormal study and to translate that consensus opinion into objective 
criteria for determining severity. The final scoring system 
criteria are shown in Table 1. Examples of overnight oximetry 
trend graphs for each score are shown in Fig 1. 

Phase 2: Retrospective Validation of the Score 

This scoring system (Table 1) was then applied to the overnight 
oximetry tests performed as part of in-laboratory PSG or a home 
cardiorespiratory sleep study (CRSS)18 for evaluation of suspected 
OSA between 1992 and 1998. Detailed information on the perioperative 
course of children in this cohort has been published previously.
19 Each overnight oximetry test was scored by a single 
investigator (G.M.N.), without knowledge of the results of the 
PSG/CRSS or the postoperative course of the patient. The oximetry 
score was then correlated with indices of severity of OSA as 
defined by the PSG/CRSS. The incidence of intervention for respiratory 
compromise in the postoperative period was also compared 
between the groups. Major postoperative respiratory compromise 
was defined by a requirement for 1 or more of the 
following interventions, from the time of emergence from anesthesia: 
ventilation with a bag and mask, administration of continuous 
positive airways pressure, reintubation, administration of 
medication for airway compromise or respiratory distress, placement 
of an oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal airway, and/or unplanned 
admission to the pediatric intensive care unit for respiratory 
compromise. Minor postoperative respiratory compromise 
was defined by a requirement for oxygen therapy beyond the 
usual period (15–30 minutes postoperatively) or repositioning of 
the child to improve airway patency. 

Phase 3: Prospective Evaluation of the Score 

After the above evaluation, we began systematically performing 
overnight oximetry as a first test in children who were referred 
to the sleep laboratory with suspected OSA. A parent comes to the 
sleep laboratory to obtain the oximeter, receives instruction in its 
use, performs the test on the child at home overnight, and returns 
the oximeter to the laboratory for downloading and interpretation 
the following morning. Occasionally, the test was performed on an 
inpatient when the medical team suspected OSA. Consecutive 
patients who were referred for suspected OSA from October 1, 
2001, until September 30, 2002, were included in the analysis. The 
patient group represents a clinical group of children with adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy and includes a small number of children 
with other medical conditions (see Results). 

We devised a clinical management protocol based on the oximetry 
score for children undergoing T&A for OSA, after the results 
of the retrospective analysis found that the oximetry score correlated 
with severity of OSA and predicted a higher risk of postoperative 
respiratory compromise. Children who had an oximetry 
score of 1 (normal/inconclusive) were scheduled for a more comprehensive 
sleep study. Those with an oximetry score of 2 were 
referred to an otolaryngologist for T&A on an elective basis. For 
those with a score of 3, surgery was recommended on an expedited 
basis, preferably within 2 weeks of the oximetry test. Children 
in this group were to be treated postoperatively in the 
postanesthetic care unit for the first night, with continuous arterial

oxygen percent saturation (SaO2) monitoring. Children with an 
oximetry score of 4 were referred for T&A on an emergency basis, 
with the aim of performing T&A within 24 to 48 hours of the 
oximetry test. Children with an oximetry score of 4 had a preoperative 
evaluation including a chest radiograph, complete blood 
count, electrocardiogram and early-morning capillary blood gas, 
and an anesthetic consultation. Postoperatively, those with a score 
of 4 were admitted electively to the pediatric intensive care unit, 
with continuous monitoring as for category 3. Details of the postoperative 
course were assessed from the patient records by an 
anesthesiologist (K.B.) who was blinded to the preoperative oximetry 
score. Major and minor respiratory compromise was defined 
as for phase 2. 

For assessing the ease of use and interobserver repeatability of 
the oximetry score, 3 clinicians not involved in the development of 
the score were asked to evaluate 100 overnight oximetry recordings. 
The independent scorers were a clinical fellow in pediatric 
respiratory medicine, a clinical fellow in anesthesiology, and a 
sleep laboratory technologist. The last had experience in use of the 
score; the first 2 scorers had not used the scoring system before, 
and the anesthesiology fellow had no experience in interpreting 
overnight oximetry records. A training session in interpretation of 


overnight oximetry was provided to each scorer by the same 
investigator (G.M.N.), including explanation of the definition of a 
cluster of desaturation events and identification of movement 
artifact-related desaturation events.14,17 This was followed by a 
practice run using 4 oximetry recordings that were not part of the 
evaluation. The entire teaching session took approximately 20 
minutes. The overnight oximetry recordings from 100 consecutive 
children who were referred for evaluation of suspected OSA after 
October 1, 2002 (including those used in phase 3) were then 
presented to the scorer in random order. This group included 
unselected tests with proportions of each severity as is usually 
seen in referred patients. No additional clinical information was 
provided. The time taken to determine the score was recorded for 
each oximetry test, and the scores were compared with the score 
assigned to the test at the time it was performed (scored by R.T.B. 
or G.M.N.). 

Statistical Analysis 

Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS for Windows 
program, version 9.0.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). Comparisons between 
scorers in the development of the score and evaluation of its

use are made using the weighted . 
statistic.20 This method for 
measuring agreement with ordinal data assigns weight based on 
the magnitude of observed disagreement so that disagreement 
between categories 2 and 3 is given less weight than between 
categories 2 and 4, for example. The relationships between oximetry 
score and PSG results were analyzed using Kruskall-Wallis 
analysis of variance; posthoc analyses used Dunnett’s C test. Proportions 
of subjects in each oximetry category requiring postoperative 
respiratory intervention were compared using Kendall’s 

-b (for ordinal variables) or Fisher’s exact test when any group 
contained 5 subjects. Waiting time for surgery was not normally 
distributed; thus, median waiting times are given and compared 
between groups using Kruskall-Wallis analysis of variance. 
RESULTS 

Phase 1: Development of the Scoring System 

Of the 64 children who had T&A on the urgent 
surgical list between January 1, 1999, and March 31, 
2001, 31 had preoperative overnight oximetry recordings 
available for analysis. Without instruction 
in how to categorize the oximetry studies, the overall 
interrater agreement among the 3 scorers was 56%. 
Much of the variation between scorers was crossover 
between categories 3 and 4, with an average 
weighted . 
statistic of 0.55 reflecting moderate agreement.
20 After discussion of differences, the scorers 
agreed on objective and easily implemented criteria 
for each category (Table 1). 

Phase 2: Retrospective Validation of the Score 

Between October 1992 and April 1998, 349 children 
were referred to the Sleep Laboratory at Montreal 
Children’s Hospital. Of these, 163 had T&A (n . 
143), adenoidectomy (n . 
14), or tonsillectomy (n . 
6) performed within 6 months of the PSG/CRSS.19 
Pulse oximetry recorded during the preoperative 
sleep study was available for review in 155 (95%) of 
the surgical cases, 80% of which were performed 
during a CRSS performed in the child’s home.18 

Children with higher oximetry scores had more 
severe OSA by PSG/CRSS criteria (Table 2). Higher 
oximetry scores were associated with a higher apneahypopnea 
index (AHI; P . 
.001), higher desaturation 
index (P . 
.001), lower SaO2 nadir (P . 
.001), and 

higher respiratory arousal index (P . 
.001). Posthoc 
analyses revealed a difference between all of the 
oximetry score groups except 2 and 3, but these 2 
scores were kept separate because of differences in 
postoperative complication rates. Oximetry score 
was significantly associated with an increasing proportion 
of subjects who required intervention for 
respiratory compromise in the postoperative period 
(P . 
.01, Fisher’s exact test). A positive oximetry 
(score 2–4) detected 9 (82%) of 11 children who required 
major intervention for respiratory compromise 
(Table 2). The missed cases both were boys, 
aged 20 and 22 months, with preoperative AHIs of 

5.0 and 8.3 events/hour, respectively, on preoperative 
PSG without desaturation 90%. Both required 
brief bag-and-mask ventilation on emergence from 
anesthesia. One boy required oxygen in the recovery 
room, but no other interventions were required in 
either case after that time. The positive predictive 
value of oximetry for major respiratory compromise 
was 10% (9 of 86). 
Phase 3: Prospective Evaluation of the Score 

A total of 230 children (39% female; 65% white; 
median age: 4.3 years) had overnight oximetry as a 
first test for suspected OSA in 12 months. Eighty 
percent of parents reported that their children had no 
other medical problems. Reported medical problems 
included asthma or other chronic lung disease (12), 
Down syndrome (3), obesity (3), developmental delay 
(8), and other significant medical condition (9). 
The outcome after oximetry testing could not be 
determined in 7 cases (4 girls; median age: 4.4 years), 
and these were excluded from additional analyses. 
All 7 had normal/inconclusive oximetry (category 
1). 

The oximetry study was technically unsatisfactory 
in 8 (3.5%) cases, because 6 hours were recorded 
before disconnection of the oximeter (5 of 8 [63%] 
were younger than 3 years, compared with 30% of 
the whole group (P . 
.06, Fisher’s exact test). Oximetry 
was repeated in 4 cases within 1 month of the

first test; all were successful, and 1 patient had a 
positive result (category 2). Including these repeated 
tests, the oximetry was considered to be positive for 
OSA (score 2, 3, or 4) in a total of 51 (22%) of 230 
cases. These patients were referred directly for consideration 
of T&A without additional testing. Those 
with a normal or inconclusive oximetry (category 1, 
n . 
172) or technically unsatisfactory oximetry (n . 
7) were recommended to undergo a more detailed 
sleep study. The course of additional investigation 
and treatment after the oximetry was available for 
223 (97%) of 230 children; all additional analysis was 
performed on this subset. 

Of 178 of 223 children with a normal, inconclusive, 
or technically unsatisfactory oximetry, 119 (67%) of 
178 had either a PSG (33) or a CRSS (86); a PSG or 
CRSS is planned for an additional 7 children. Additional 
testing after oximetry was refused by the referring 
doctor or parent in the remaining 47 (26%) of 
178 children. The PSG or CRSS was diagnostic of 
OSA in 58 (49%) of 119 children, and these children 
were referred for T&A. The oximetry recorded during 
PSG/CRSS remained inconclusive for OSA (category 
1) in all cases. 

A total of 113 patients have had T&A for OSA, 
including 49 of 50 with a positive oximetry, 34 of 58 
with a positive PSG/CRSS, and 30 of 47 in whom an 
inconclusive oximetry (category 1) was the only preoperative 
test. As envisioned at protocol development, 
there was an inverse relationship between the 
oximetry score and waiting time for surgery 
(Kruskal-Wallis test, P . 
.001; Fig 2). 

Details for the postoperative course were available 


Fig 2. Waiting times for surgery by oximetry group. “Oximetry 
only” refers to those children in whom overnight oximetry was 
normal or inconclusive for OSA, who proceeded to have T&A 
without additional sleep studies. “Positive PSG/CRSS” are those 
children with a normal or inconclusive overnight oximetry in 
whom OSA was subsequently diagnosed by PSG or home CRSS. 
Categories 2 to 4 refer to children with positive oximetry results. 
Median waiting times are 86 days for oximetry only, 217 days for 
positive PSG/CRSS, 77 days for category 2, 36 days for category 3, 
and 4 days for category 4 (P . 
.001, Kruskall Wallis analysis of 
variance). 

for 102 (90%) of 113 children. Postoperative respiratory 
compromise was significantly related to oximetry 
score (P . 
.003, Fisher’s exact test; Table 3). In 
addition, subgroup analysis was statistically significant 
for both major and minor respiratory compromise; 
those with higher oximetry scores had a higher 
incidence of complications, as had been found in 
phase 2. The positive predictive value of oximetry for 
major respiratory compromise was 13% (6 of 48). A 
positive oximetry (categories 2–4) detected 25 of 35 
(sensitivity: 71%) of those who required any intervention 
for respiratory compromise in the postoperative 
period and 6 of 7 (sensitivity: 86%) of those who 
had major postoperative respiratory compromise. 
The 1 major complication that occurred in a child 
with an oximetry score of 1 occurred in an otherwise 
healthy 3.7-year-old boy who required bag-andmask 
ventilation for laryngospasm in the recovery 
room. He had not had a PSG/CRSS, so the severity of 
OSA was unknown. Eight of the 9 children who had 
an inconclusive oximetry and went on to have minor 
postoperative respiratory compromise were in high-
risk groups based on the literature21: 4 were younger 
than 3 years, 2 others had an AHI 10 events/hour, 
and 2 had significant comorbidity. The outstanding 
minor complication (required supplemental oxygen) 
occurred in a 4.3-year-old girl with an AHI of 
7/hour. 

After the 20-minute training session, the 3 test 
scorers (“learners”) took a median time of 9 seconds 
per study to apply the score to the 100 oximetries 
(interquartile range: 2, 45 seconds; maximum: 5 minutes). 
Raw agreement with the score given to the 
oximetry recording at the time it was performed 

(G.M.N. or R.T.B., “experts”) was 87%, 88%, and 97% 
for the pediatric respiratory fellow, the anesthesiology 
fellow, and the sleep technologist, respectively 
(weighted : 0.85, 0.86, and 0.97, all demonstrating 
almost perfect agreement20). Scores differed on a 
total of 27 (9.0%) of 300 occasions. Oximetry results 
were misclassified as positive on 10 (3.3%) of 300 
occasions, as a result in all but 1 case of the misinterpretation 
of movement artifact by the learners. On 
3 occasions, a positive oximetry was read as inconclusive 
(category 1) by the learners. On 14 (4.6%) of 
300 occasions, the score was reported as positive by 
both the learners and the experts but the severity 
category did not agree. The learners overread the 
oximetry on 6 occasions and underread it on 8 but 
were 1 category different on only 1 occasion (category 
4 by experts and category 2 by learner). 
DISCUSSION 

We present the development and prospective evaluation 
of a scoring system for overnight oximetry 
testing in children with suspected OSA. The score 
objectifies consensus opinion as to what constitutes a 
mildly, moderately, or severely abnormal oximetry 
result. The score was correlated with the severity of 
OSA as measured by PSG. In our series, a positive 
oximetry test (categories 2–4) detected children who 
were at higher risk of respiratory compromise requiring 
intervention in the postoperative period. After 
implementation of our protocol, children with a

positive overnight oximetry waited less time for surgery 
than those who had to wait for a more complex 
evaluation of breathing during sleep. The greatest 
benefit of this oximetry-based protocol—surgical intervention 
with minimal delay—accrued to those 
with the most severe impairment of oxygenation 
during sleep. 

The preoperative overnight SaO2 nadir has been 
associated with an increased risk of postoperative 
respiratory compromise.19,21,22 The proposed score 
has 3 main advantages over a simple SaO2 nadir as a 
preoperative test: 1) our score is based on previous 
work showing that oximetry can have a high positive 
predictive value for OSA,14 2) a single fall in SaO2 
may be seen during sleep in normal children in association 
with a central apnea23 and thus will be less 
specific for detecting desaturation as a result of OSA, 
and 3) the score grades the severity of abnormality 
based on the frequency and depth of the desaturations 
and thus is not an all-or-nothing test. 

PSG is the most comprehensive way of quantifying 
ventilatory and sleep abnormalities caused by 
OSA and is currently the gold standard diagnostic 
modality.12 However, many children undergo T&A 
for OSA on the basis of clinical history and examination 
findings alone. Although history and examination 
findings have been demonstrated to have 
poor specificity for OSA10 and do not allow the clinician 
to anticipate which patients might be at highest 
risk of postoperative respiratory complications, 
many children undergo T&A for OSA without the 
benefit of any testing. An ideal screening test for 
OSA would be easy to carry out, be inexpensive, and 
have high positive and negative predictive values for 
OSA. Oximetry meets the first 2 of these criteria and 
has a high positive predictive value.14 We believe, 
therefore, that it has validity and potential applications 
in centers where children are referred for evaluation 
of suspected OSA. Where PSG is not available 
or is likely to be significantly delayed, overnight 
oximetry may be used to select patients who require 
surgery on an expedited basis and those who require 
close postoperative monitoring in a center that is 
capable of providing emergency respiratory support 
after hours. 

Some cautionary notes regarding the use of overnight 
oximetry as an abbreviated diagnostic test in 
the evaluation of children with suspected OSA are in 
order. Despite the benefits outlined above, oximetry 

testing has a low negative predictive value for 
OSA14; children with a normal or inconclusive test 
may have significant OSA. An oximetry score of 1 
(normal/inconclusive) therefore should not be used 
to reassure parents or clinicians of the absence of 
significant OSA. The information provided by nocturnal 
pulse oximetry, hemoglobin saturation, and 
pulse rate is far less complete than that provided by 
PSG. Thus, PSG should be used when a comprehensive 
assessment of sleep and breathing is required. 
The characteristics of the oximeter being used are 
also extremely important. An oximeter with a long 
averaging time will underestimate the brief desaturation 
events seen in children with OSA, and oximeters 
that are prone to movement artifact may overestimate 
desaturation events, especially in young 
children who move a lot during sleep.24 

Whether it is reasonable to prioritize cases for T&A 
on the basis of our oximetry score depends on the 
face, criterion, and construct validity of the score and 
on interobserver repeatability. Animal studies provide 
experimental evidence of the adverse neural 
effects of recurrent brief hypoxemia, specifically, 
learning impairment, hyperactivity, and apoptosis in 
the hippocampus and cortex.25 This suggests that 
prioritization on the basis of the frequency and severity 
of desaturation makes sense (ie, has face validity). 
The choice of 80% as a cutoff for the most 
severe category was based on evidence of increased 
risk of postoperative respiratory compromise at this 
level of SaO2 nadir.19,21,22 On retrospective analysis, 
increasing oximetry score was associated with increasing 
severity of OSA, and the score was correlated 
with the AHI, the respiratory arousal index, 
and the desaturation index as measured with more 
complex tests of respiration during sleep (criterion 
validity). The scoring system was applied quickly 
and accurately by scorers who were not involved in 
its development, suggesting that the scoring system 
is easy to learn and apply (high interobserver repeatability). 


The question remains, however, whether the oximetry 
score is a good measure of surgical priority 
(construct validity). It is a limitation of our study that 
we have not attempted to measure the adverse outcome 
of a prolonged waiting time for T&A. It is not 
known whether waiting weeks to months for surgery 
would make a difference to morbidity or mortality in 
children with severe OSA, but it is feasible that it

might, given the evidence of the adverse effect of 
hypoxemia on the developing brain15 and the known 
association of severe OSA with cor pulmonale, failure 
to thrive, and adverse neurobehavioral outcomes.
3,4,26,27 Proof that surgical delay affects morbidity 
would require a randomized, controlled trial, 
with the test group at an increased risk that would 
not be ethically justified. 

CONCLUSIONS 

In this study, we validated a severity scoring system 
for overnight oximetry, demonstrating that it 
reflects the underlying severity of OSA and identifies 
children who are at increased risk of postoperative 
respiratory compromise. We show that prioritizing 
operative intervention on the basis of oximetry score 
can shorten the diagnostic and treatment process for 
those with more severe disease. Likewise, knowledge 
of oximetry results can aid clinicians in planning 
perioperative care. However, oximetry is inconclusive 
in a large number of children with suspected 
OSA and cannot replace PSG for the definitive diagnosis 
of OSA.
