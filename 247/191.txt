ABSTRACT: 
The objective of this study was to quantify behavioral 
and attention capacity changes in children aged 4–11 y before and 
3 mo after adenotonsillectomy (A/T). Overnight cardiorespiratory 
recordings were performed in 61 “behaviorally normal” children 
1 wk before A/T. Tests of sustained attention using visual and 
auditory continuous performance tests (CPT) were completed by 
children 1 wk before and 3 mo after A/T. Behavioral Assessment 
Scales for Children (BASC) and a sleep questionnaire were completed 
by the parent/s at these same times. Results from overnight 
cardiorespiratory recordings showed that the children had mild sleep-
related breathing disorders (SRBD) preoperatively with a mean 
apnea/hypopnea index of 3.0/h and a movement awakening index of 
2.5/h. The majority had parent-perceived sleep and breathing difficulties 
that significantly improved post-A/T. BASC T 
scores for 
externalizing and internalizing behaviors improved post-A/T, e.g., 
behavioral symptom index mean pre-A/T was 56.2 (95% confidence 
interval, 52.8–59.6) compared with 50.9 (48.5–53.5) post-A/T. Some 
measures indicative of impulsivity and attentiveness obtained from 
the visual CPT before surgery, improved post-A/T, but no change 
was observed in any auditory CPT measures. Our data confirm 
improvements in subjective measures of sleep problems in children 
treated for SRBD and strengthen the notion of treating the disorder, 
not only related to the obvious clinical condition but also to the 
underlying sleep problems and adverse effects on daytime behavior 
and attention. (Pediatr

hildren with adenotonsillar hypertrophy are at risk of 
suffering SRBD (1), with snoring, difficulty breathing, 
apnea, and persistent mouth breathing that ranges from primary 
snoring, through upper airways resistance syndrome, to 
OSA. The most common treatment for children with adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy or recurrent tonsillitis is A/T. This has 
been shown to result in clinical improvement in the majority 
of cases. In severe cases involving OSA, failure to treat can be 
associated with serious morbidity such as failure to thrive and 
systemic hypertension, and pulmonary hypertension with or 
without cor pulmonale can develop (1). 

SRBD have been linked to daytime behavioral problems, 
predominantly those associated with hyperactivity, aggression, 
and inattention (2–4), and poorer performance on tests of 
memory and intelligence (5). At short-term follow-up after 

treatment, significant improvements in children’s vigilance 
and behavior in areas of aggression, inattention, impulsivity 
and hyperactivity (6,7), and quality of life (8) have been 
reported. Also reported are short-term improvements in several 
cognitive factors such as perceptual closure, inference, 
organization, visual and auditory short-term memory, ability 
to solve problems and think analytically (9), and learning 1 y 
after treatment for a SRBD in poor academic achievers (10). 

The main physiologic characteristics during sleep for children 
with SRBD are intermittent hypoxemia associated with 
frequent apneas, hypopneas and sleep fragmentation due to 
frequent arousals, awakenings, and a reduction in REM sleep, 
all of which may impact adversely on neurobehavioral functioning 
(11). These adverse effects are well documented, 
although only a few small prospective studies have been 
carried out. The aim of this study was to quantify the behavioral 
and attention changes in children aged 4–11 y, before 
and 3 mo after surgery, and to examine any potential relationships 
between the severity of SRBD and changes in the main 
outcomes of behavior and attention. 

METHODS 


Subjects. 
The sample comprised 61 children aged 4–11 y. Subjects were 
recruited from a surgical waiting list for A/T following referral by an 
otolaryngologist; 19 (31%) because of obstructive airway symptoms relating 
to adenotonsillar hypertrophy and 42 (59%) because of recurrent episodes of 
tonsillitis. Tonsillar size was graded according to the reduction in pharyngeal 
diameter at the fauces (12): Grade I, 0–25%; II, 26–50%; III, 51–75% and; 
IV, 76–100%. Exclusion criteria were gross sensory or motor problems, 
significant developmental delay, or previous diagnosis of attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or taking medication for ADHD. Recruitment 
success was 55%. Deprivation index scores [New Zealand (NZ) Dep2001] 
were calculated for each child’s domicile using GeoStan NZ (version 2.1). 
This uses data extracted from the 2001 census dividing NZ into 10ths of 
distributions in relation to several indicators of socioeconomic deprivation. 
The Otago Ethics Committee approved the study. Informed written consent 
was obtained from parent/s of all participants and with assent from the child. 

Overnight 
cardiorespiratory 
recordings. 
One week before adenotonsillectomy 
(pre-A/T), each child underwent one night of cardiorespiratory recording. 
Thoracic and abdominal movements were recorded by inductive plethysmography 
(Respitrace model 150; Respitrace Co., NY ); SaO2 and pulse 
signal by pulse oximetry (Nellcor N-200, Nellcor, Pleasanton, CA); nasal 
airflow by thermistry (MLT415, ADInstruments Pty. Ltd., Castle Hill, Australia); 
breath sounds by microphone placed over the sternal notch; and ECG

was recorded using standard position electrodes. All signals were relayed 
through an analog-to-digital converter (PowerLab, ADInstruments Pty. Ltd.). 
Sleep, movement, and awakenings were recorded using time-lapse video 
recordings with an infrared light source. Because there were no EEG or 
electrooculogram recordings, behavioral movement awakenings were quantified 
using video recording observations together with increases in heart rate. 
A movement awakening index was expressed as the total number of movement 
awakenings per hour of TRT, i.e., time from behaviorally observed sleep 
onset to morning awakening. Sleep efficiency and snoring were calculated as 
the percentage of behaviorally observed sleep time. Respiratory events were 
classified and their number, frequency and duration recorded. Obstructive 
apnea was defined as the absence of airflow with continued chest wall and 
abdominal movement for at least two respiratory cycles (13,14). Obstructive 
hypopnea was defined as a decrease in airflow to less than 50% baseline 
amplitude for at least two respiratory cycles (15). An obstructive AHI was 
defined as the total number of obstructive apneas, hypopneas, and mixed 
apneas per hour of behaviorally observed sleep time. On the basis of “normative 
data,” an obstructive AHI index 1.5 was chosen as the cutoff for 
outside the range of normal (15). 

Sleep 
and 
breathing 
questionnaire. 
As for all questionnaires, the parent 
(predominantly mother) completed this 28-item questionnaire 1 wk before 
surgery (pre-A/T) and 3 mo after (post-A/T). Questions were based on clinical 
experience and published signs and symptoms of children with SRBD with 
particular reference to a parent questionnaire designed by Brouillette et 
al. 


(16) for discriminating between children with and without proven SRBD from 
polysomnography and included questions about child and family history of 
breathing difficulties during sleep, sleep hygiene, snoring, enuresis, sweating 
during sleep, periodic limb movements, levels of household smoking, and 
daytime signs of sleepiness. Responses to the main questions were categorized 
as never/sometimes/often/always, with room for additional comments 
where appropriate. 
BASC. 
The BASC Parent Rating Scales (17), a 131-to 138-item questionnaire 
that assesses a child’s adaptive and problem behaviors in home and 
community settings, were completed pre-and post-A/T. Two forms were 
used, targeted at children aged 4 –5 y and 6–11 y. These contain descriptors 
of behaviors that respondents rate on a 4-point scale ranging from “never” to 
“almost always.” The scores yield a clinical profile and an adaptive profile 
(for 6–11 y olds). T-scores calculated represent a standard score normalized 
for the age of the child using a mean of 50 and a SD of 10. Test-retest 
reliability coefficients for the parent-completed rating scale over a 2– 8 wk 
interval range from 0.41 to 0.94 (17). 

Tests 
of 
sustained 
attention. 
Visual and auditory continuous performance 
tests (CPT) taking 15 min each were used to measure sustained attention pre-
and post-A/T, but were available to 6-to 11-y-old children only (n 
. 
39). The 
Visual Conners’ Continuous Performance Test (VCPT) II (18) is a computerized 
tool where stimuli (white letters) appear on a black screen for 250 ms 
at varying interstimulus intervals (ISI; 1, 2, and 4 s). Children respond by 
pressing the space bar immediately, except when the target letter X 
appears. 
The test measures reaction time, inattention, impulsivity, and variability of 
reaction time. Test-retest reliabilities over 3 mo range from 0.55 to 0.84 for 
the most relevant outcomes (18). 

The Auditory Continuous Performance Test (ACPT) (19) required children 
to listen to a string of 120 words repeated six times over, and indicate to the 
experimenter, whenever they heard the target word dog. Total error scores 
were calculated from the sum of omissions (inattention error) and commissions 
(impulsive error), and a vigilance decrement calculated [difference in 
percentage of responses to dog 
in the first presentation to the last (sixth)]. 
Test-retest reliability show moderate coefficient scores of 0.67 and 0.74 for 
children aged 7 and 9 y, respectively (19). 

Statistical 
analyses. 
Statistical analyses were performed using STATA 
version 8.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). Nonparametric tests using 
Spearman’s correlation coefficients were used to look for correlations between 
cardiorespiratory variables with continuous data. Standard logistic regression 
was used to investigate potential relationships between AHI (. 
or 1.5), 
tonsillar size (grades 1 and II or III and IV), and other cardiorespiratoryderived 
variables. To investigate whether variables suggestive of a SRBD 
(pre-A/T) could predict behavioral scores, standard logistic regression was 
used for AHI (. 
or 1.5) and ANOVA for SaO2 nadir, the movement 
awakening index, and percentage of recording snoring (transformed into 
tertiles). For sleep and breathing questionnaire-derived responses, 2 analyses 
were performed (dichotomous outcomes), and pre-and post-treatment were 
compared using binomial statistics. Comparisons of pre-and post-treatment 
indices for behavior and attention, and deviations from the norm, were made 
with paired t 
tests with p 
values adjusted for unequal variances where 
appropriate. A value of p 
. 
0.05 (two-tailed test) was considered statistically 
significant.

2 y. Most had a normal body mass index (18.1 . 
4.0 
kg/m2), although 24% were overweight or obese for their age 
according to Cole et 
al. 
(20). Tonsillar size was graded I, II, 
III, and IV in 8, 36, 50, and 6% of the sample, respectively. 
Smoking by at least one person was present in the households 
of 47%. Children came from the full spectrum of domiciles, 
ranging from the 10% least deprived areas indicated by a 
NZDep2001 score of 1, to the 10% most deprived areas 
scoring 10; mean .

that the sample was drawn from a population with different

Cardiorespiratory 
findings. 
Results are summarized in Table 
1. Using an AHI index 1.5 for being outside the range of 
“normal” (15), 43 children (70%) reached this cutoff. Of the 
19 children with obstructive airway symptoms from clinical 
history and examination alone, 14 (74%) reached this cutoff. 
Ten children had an AHI 5, 21% of those presenting with 
obstructive airway symptoms and 16% with just a history of 
recurrent tonsillitis. There was a tendency for tonsillar size to 
be related to AHI 1.5 [odds ratio (OR), 2.10; 95% confidence 
interval (CI), 0.82–5.36). Mean sleep efficiency was 
87%, with only two children scoring 70%. Eighty-seven 
percent (n 
. 
53) exhibited a SaO2 nadir between 95 and 90; 
13% (n 
. 
8) reached 90%. SaO2 nadir was inversely correlated 
with AHI (r 
. 
–0.46, p 
. 
0.001) and the percentage of 
recorded snoring (r 
. 
–0.27, p 
. 
0.05), and AHI was 
positively correlated with the percentage of recorded snoring 
(r 
. 
0.33, p 
. 
0.015). 

Sleep 
and 
breathing 
items. 
The results are summarized in 
Table 2. Data were analyzed only when complete pre-post 
data were available, as sometimes parents chose not to answer 
or missed answering a particular question that precluded 
inclusion in the pre-post data analyses. Sleep and breathing 
disturbance item responses ranging from “never” to “always” 
were frequently reported pre-A/T. Sixty-four percent of the 
sample was reported to snore “frequently or constantly,” but 
there was no significant relationship between this and the 
presence of household smoking. There was a slight trend for 
reported snoring levels by the parent and those measured

in all items including drenching sweats. Less than 10% of 
children were reported to have restless legs, enuresis, and 
headaches “frequently or constantly” before or after surgery. 

Behavior. 
BASC scores are given in Table 3. Before surgery 
(pre-A/T), the following variable scores within the clinical 
profile were significantly higher than the T 
score mean 
(50), but still within average range: hyperactivity, aggression, 
depression, somatization, attentional problems, and composite 
scores for externalizing and internalizing behaviors including 
the behavioral symptom index. Other variables within the 
clinical profile scores (i.e., conduct problems, anxiety, atypicality, 
and withdrawal) were not significantly different from 
the T 
score mean. Post-A/T behavioral variable changes significantly 
improved for all except conduct problems, and T 
scores were no longer different from the mean. Adaptive 
profile scores were never significantly different from the T 
score mean, pre-or post-A/T. Linear regression analyses to 

look for any association of cardiorespiratory variables pre-A/T 
with concomitant behavioral scores revealed no significant 
correlation. 

Tests 
of 
attention. 
Table 4 gives a summary of the T 
scores 
for the 11 VCPT variables. Comparisons with the normal 
population mean showed that significantly higher scores for 
commissions (indicator for inattention and impulsivity) and 
detectability (indicator for inattention) were present pre-A/T 
but were within the average range of a normal nonclinical 
score. Significant improvements were found after surgery. 
Lower scores for hit reaction time (HRT) SE by ISI were 
detected pre-A/T, suggesting the group showed more consistent 
responses in their ability to change their reaction time in 
response to changing ISI. No other measures were significantly 
different from the population norm. 

Table 5 gives ACPT summary scores for total errors by age 
group. Comparison with normative mean data showed all, 
excluding age 7, were within the range of normal and showed 
no change in attention abilities post-A/T. The group of 7-y-

Analyses to predict whether variables suggestive of a 
SRBD (pre-A/T) (i.e., AHI, SaO2 nadir, movement awakening 
index, and percentage snoring) could predict behavioral scores 
resulted in one significant association and one trend worth 
reporting. Thus, AHI was significantly positively associated 
with hyperactivity [50.8 .

and 1.5, respectively; p

a positive association with the behavioral symptom index 

(51.7 .

0.08). No other 
significant associations were found. 
DISCUSSION 


This study of behaviorally normal children referred for A/T 
showed that several parent-rated indices of child behavior 
significantly improved 3 mo after surgery. Objective testing of 

children’s sustained attention also showed improvements in 
some areas indicative of inattentive and impulsive symptoms. 
A higher level of age-adjusted scores for many of the behavioral 
indices found before surgery concurs with other reports 
where behaviors such as hyperactivity and aggression have 
also been associated with SRBD (21,22). Owens et 
al. 
(22) 
have suggested that these externalizing behaviors may be in 
part reflective of daytime somnolence, and thus of an underlying 
sleep disturbance. Our subjective measures of the severity 
of the nighttime disruption to sleep and breathing, including 
daytime somnolence, certainly revealed marked 
improvements after surgery. However, we found no association 
of factors that looked at somnolence in particular with any 
of the higher behavioral scores reported before surgery. 

Before proceeding further, there are some methodological 
limitations to this study that warrant comment. There was no 
concurrent control group and thus we cannot exclude the 
possibility that some of the attentional test improvements 
observed postoperatively were a practiced effect despite valid 
test-retest reliability data (18,19). The behavioral questionnaire 
changes were parent-perceived. The parents could never 
be blinded to the procedure so belief and expectation may

BEHAVIOR AFTER ADENOTONSILLECTOMY 

have played some part in the perceived improvements. Despite 
these limitations, our findings are consistent with the large 
body of evidence in the literature reporting an adverse association 
between SRBD and several facets of daytime functioning 
(2–5) together with data showing improvements after A/T 
(6–10). 

In contrast to the externalizing and internalizing behaviors, 
measures of the children’s adaptive skills and the sub-scales of 
adaptability, social skills, and leadership were all judged to be 
close to the norm before surgery and remained so at follow-up. 
Adaptive skills may be considered learned behaviors that 
appeared to be unaffected by the SRBD. We did not test 
specifically for cognitive processing, but a study of children 
age 5–9 y with longer term follow-up (6–10 mo) showed 
significant improvements in neurocognitive function including 
academic performance after adenotonsillectomy (9). Children 
with SRBD in whom the condition is left untreated have been 
suggested to be at risk of underachieving academically (9,10). 
Improvements in learning have been reported after treatment 
(3,10). However, the report that children who snore loudly and 
frequently during childhood risk poorer academic performance 
in later years, even well after the snoring has resolved, 
suggests that treatment may only reverse a learning deficit in 
the short term (23). 

Our study showed that the VCPT revealed some mild 
impulsive and inattentive symptoms in children before surgery 
that reversed to the general population mean norm after 
surgery. The markers for inattentiveness included the detect-
ability measure. This is a measure of a child’s discriminatory 
power, suggesting that minor perceptual difficulties were evident 
before surgery. We acknowledge that repeatability of the 
task may have influenced our results, but the time frame of 3 
mo was well outside of the 1–14 d test-retest reliability studies 
that showed moderate correlations (19). Also, our findings 
concur with others in that several studies have shown that 
children with SRBD have poorer measures of attention span 
compared with a control group (3,9,21). Furthermore, Fried-
man et 
al. 
(9) have shown that the poor attention span in 
OSA-treated children, followed-up 6–10 mo after surgery, 
reversed compared with that of their control group. Avior et 
al. 
(7), using a comparable visual CPT tool in a small sample 
of children with OSA have shown 2-mo postoperative improvements 
in measures of both inattention and impulsivity. 
The auditory test we used, however, did not expose any 
deficits in attention, impulsivity, or vigilance. An anomaly 
was seen in the group of 7-y-olds who performed better than 
the norm for their age group before and after surgery and the 
10-y-olds after surgery. This particular age group had a bias 
toward good performance that was unavoidable with the small 
sample numbers. 

Funding restrictions limited our ability to perform overnight 
cardiorespiratory studies at follow-up, but the positive result 
from the parental questionnaires designed to measure the 
symptoms and severity of a number of sleep and breathing 
items suggest overall improvement of sleep and breathing 
disturbances after A/T. The findings support other studies also 
based on parental reports (9,24,25), although we acknowledge 
that parental perception of their child’s resolution of SRDB 

can sometimes be wrong (26). However, it is well documented 
that as many as 80% of children have polysomnographically 
determined improved breathing during sleep and resolution of 
SRBD after A/T (25,26), and our results would suggest from 
subjective measures that up to 60% improved depending on 
the breathing item chosen. Others have also shown significant 
improvements of many polysomnographic-derived variables 
(6,27,28). A recent study evaluating polysomnographic data 
before and a few months after surgery showed significant 
improvements in all respiratory parameters with a greater 
improvement in the respiratory disturbance index in non-REM 
compared with REM sleep and significant improvements in 
the arousal index (29). 

The overnight cardiorespiratory data gave an indication of 
the severity of SRBD in the population under study, although 
we acknowledge that these data were taken from one night 
only, so the influence of night-to-night variability could not be 
taken into account. We also acknowledge that, in the absence 
of accurate sleep staging in the recording, the influence of 
repeated micro-arousals on the severity of nighttime disturbance 
could not be taken into account. The majority of the 
children rated in the mild SRBD category, with very few 
having an AHI 5, suggesting that the group might not be 
representative of the true clinical population. We did not 
specifically exclude those with severe SRBD, but the public 
hospital points referral system may have meant that those with 
severe symptoms received immediate treatment or sought 
private treatment without linking into the hospital waiting list. 
The range of waiting time for surgery over the study period 
was between 3 and 6 mo. The finding that the AHI 1.5 was 
mildly associated with hyperactivity deserves further investigation 
in children with more severe SRBD, although two 
studies have found more adverse associations of externalizing 
behaviors in children with mild OSA compared with moderate-
to-severe OSA (21,30). In one study, severity of SRBD 
has been linked to severity of verbal impairment but to very 
few other neurocognitive outcomes (21). 

Our findings do not allow us to draw conclusions as to 
possible mechanism/s whereby SRBD could contribute to 
behavioral problems or attentional difficulties. Findings from 
many studies report that chronic or intermittent hypoxemia in 
SRBD, even at a mild level, can adversely impact on children’s 
behavior, cognition, and academic performance 
(6,10,25,31). A recent study by Urschitz et 
al. 
(32) has shown 
that the specific variable of nocturnal SaO2 nadir is associated 
with impaired academic performance. Beebe and Gozal (11) 
have proposed a theoretical model that suggests that intermittent 
hypoxemia and sleep fragmentation may act synergistically 
to affect daytime behavior and cognitive functioning. A 
reduction in REM sleep, a feature of sleep fragmentation, has 
been linked to impaired consolidation of learned tasks and 
may contribute to the severity of behavioral problems in 
children (33). In the absence of EEG data, we cannot comment 
as to whether sleep disturbance related to transient arousals 
may have influenced any of the aspects of children’s daytime 
functioning in this study. 

In conclusion, this study adds to the accumulation of evidence 
that neurobehavioral functioning improves in children 



GALLAND ET 
AL. 


after treatment of SRBD. It must be emphasized that we report 
statistically significant improvements in a group of behaviorally 
“normal” children as distinct from clinically significant 
improvements. A link between SRBD and clinical diagnoses 
of behavioral disorders is not established, but there is a 
growing body of evidence that children with ADHD have a 
higher prevalence of SRBD than the normal population 
(2,31,34). The finding of improved behavior and attention 
after A/T in the current group of children, in whom a diagnosis 
of behavioral disorder was specifically excluded, may have 
implications for the pediatric population diagnosed with the 
co-existence of SRBD and behavioral and attentional disorders. 
Studies aimed at children with these co-existing conditions, 
in whom the ceiling for improvement is far higher, 
should be an objective for future studies.
