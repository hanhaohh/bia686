Summary 
Vascular

(VEGF) 
may 
be 
one 
of 
the 
pathophysiologic 
links 
in 
the 
association 
between 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea-hypopnea 
and 
cardiovascular 
disease. 
Morning 
serum 
VEGF 
levels 
are 
increased 
in 
children 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea. 
However, 
release 
of 
VEGF 
by 
platelets 
and 
leukocytes 
during 
blood 
clotting 
may 
affect 
its 
concentration 
in 
serum. 
In 
the 
present 
study, 
VEGF 
levels 
were 
measured 
in 
children 
with 
and 
without 
habitual 
snoring 
using 
plasma 
specimens. 
Evening 
and 
morning 
plasma 
VEGF 
concentrations 
were

Introduction 


Significant 
correlations 
between 
obstructive 
sleep-
disordered 
breathing 
and 
cardiovascular 
disease 
have 
been 
reported 
in 
adults. 
Even 
mild 
increases 
in 
the 
apnea–hypopnea 
index 
(AHI) 
(1–10 
episodes/ 
h) 
have 
been 
associated 
with 
higher 
risk 
for 
coronary 
artery 
disease, 
congestive 
heart 
failure 
and 
stroke.1 
Among 
other 
variables, 
systemic 
hypertension,2 
chronic 
inflammation 
and 
metabolic 
disturbances,3,4 
endothelial 
dysfunction5 
and 
changes 
in 
myocardial 
structure 
and 
function5 
have 
been 
implicated 
in 
the 
interaction 
between 
cardiovascular 
disease 
and 
sleep 
apnea. 
Similar 
abnormalities 
have 
been 
described 
in 
habitually 
snoring 
children.6–10 


Vascular 
endothelial 
growth 
factor 
(VEGF), 
a 
cytokine 
stimulating 
angiogenesis,11 
may 
contribute 
to 
the 
process 
of 
atherogenesis 
and 
development 
of 
cardiovascular 
disease.12–15 
Its 
morning 
concentrations 
are 
increased 
in 
adults 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea–hypopnea.16–18 
Treatment 
of 
sleep 
apnea 
with 
nasal 
continuous 
positive 
airway 
pressure 
or 
of 
the 
associated 
hypoxemia 
with 
administration 
of 
oxygen 
have 
been 
accompanied 
by 
a 
significant 
decrease 
in 
morning 
values 
of 


18,19 


VEGF. 


To 
our 
knowledge, 
there 
is 
only 
one 
report 
on 
morning 
serum 
levels 
of 
VEGF 
in 
children 
with 
obstructive 
sleep-disordered 
breathing.20 
Higher 
levels 
of 
VEGF 
have 
been 
detected 
in 
children 
with 
sleep 
apnea 
(apnea 
index45 
episodes/h) 
than 
in 
control 
subjects.20 
Nevertheless, 
platelets 
and 
leukocytes 
release 
VEGF 
during 
the 
process 
of 
blood 
clotting 
and 
for 
this 
reason 
measured 
concentrations 
of 
the 
factor 
are 
higher 
in 
serum 
samples 
than 
in 
plasma 
samples.20,21 
Furthermore, 
VEGF 
concentrations 
are 
not 
consistently 
increased 
in 
all 
adults 
with 
obstructive 
sleep-disordered 
breathing; 
in 
a 
recent 
study 
by 
Valipour 
and 
colleagues,22 
similar 
plasma 
VEGF 
levels 
were 
reported 
in 
adult 
participants 
with 
and 
without 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea. 
The 
aim 
of 
the 
present 
investigation 
was 
to 
measure 
evening 
and 
morning 
plasma 
VEGF 
levels 
in 
children 
with 
obstructive 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
of 
variable 
severity 
and 
in 
controls 
without 
snoring. 
We 
hypothesized 
that 
severity 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
is 
related 
to 
morning 
plasma 
VEGF 
concentration. 
To 
our 
knowledge, 
this 
is 
the 
first 
study 
assessing 
both 
evening 
and 
morning 
VEGF 
levels 
in 
children 
with 
sleep 
apnea. 


Patients 
and 
methods 


Study 
design 


Consecutive 
children, 
who 
were 
referred 
to 
the 
Sleep 
Disorders 
Laboratory 
because 
of 
habitual 
snoring 
(more 
than 
three 
nights/week) 
present 
for 
at 
least 
6 
months, 
were 
recruited 
in 
the 
study. 
Healthy 
children 
without 
history 
of 
snoring 
that 
were 
admitted 
to 
the 
pediatric 
inpatient 
service 
for 
constipation 
or 
functional 
abdominal 
pain 
were 
also 
recruited 
as 
controls. 
Children 
were 
excluded 
from 
participation 
in 
the 
study 
if 
they 
had: 
(1) 
symptoms 
or 
signs 
of 
acute 
or 
chronic 
inflammation; 
(2) 
lung 
disease 
associated 
with 
hypoxemia; 
(3) 
cardiovascular 
disease; 
and 
(4) 
neuromuscular 
or 
genetic 
disorders. 


The 
study 
protocol 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
Ethics 
Committee 
of 
the 
Larissa 
University 
Hospital. 
Informed 
consent 
was 
obtained 
from 
parents 
and 
child’s 
assent 
from 
subjects 
older 
than 
7 
years. 
Since 
January 
2003, 
more 
than 
200 
pediatric 
polysomnograms 
are 
performed 
in 
the 
Sleep 
Disorders 
Laboratory 
of 
the 
Larissa 
University 
Hospital 
annually. 
None 
of 
the 
subjects 
in 
the 
present 
investigation 
were 
included 
in 
other 
research 
projects 
that 
were 
carried 
out 
in 
our 
center.23,24 


Parents 
were 
interviewed 
and 
information 
about 
symptoms 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
and 
about 
past 
medical 
history 
was 
collected. 
All 
participants 
underwent 
a 
physical 
examination. 
Polysomnograms 
were 
performed 
overnight 
in 
the 
Sleep 
Disorders 
Laboratory 
for 
all 
children 
with 
snoring 
but 
not 
for 
controls. 
The 
Alice-4 
computerized 
system 
(Healthdyne, 
Marietta, 
GA, 
USA) 
was 
used. 


Sleep 
stages 
and 
arousals 
were 
determined 
using 
standard 
criteria.25,26 
Obstructive 
apnea 
was 
defined 
as 
the 
presence 
of 
chest/abdominal 
wall 
motion 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
airflow 
for 
at 
least 
two 
breaths 
in 
duration.27 
Hypopnea 
was: 
(1) 
a 
reduction 
in 
the 
airflow 
signal 
amplitude 
of 
at 
least 
50% 
compared 
to 
baseline; 
(2) 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
chest/ 
abdominal 
wall 
motion; 
and 
(3) 
associated 
with 
oxygen 
desaturation 
of 
hemoglobin 
equal 
to 
or 
greater 
than 
4% 
or 
with 
an 
arousal.27 
AHI, 
respiratory

were 
calculated 
as

VEGF 
measurements 


Since 
platelets 
and 
leukocytes 
release 
VEGF 
during 
blood 
clotting,21 
measurements 
were 
carried 
out 
in 
plasma 
and 
not 
serum 
specimens. 
Evening 
and 
morning 
blood 
samples 
were 
collected 
into 
glass 
tubes 
containing 
EDTA, 
were 
immediately 
centrifuged, 
and 
the 
supernatant 
(platelet-free 
plasma) 
was 
aliquoted 
and 
frozen 
at 
70 
1C 
until 
assay. 


A 
commercially 
available 
ELISA 
kit 
for 
the 
in 
vitro 
determination 
of 
human 
VEGF-165 
and 
VEGF-121 
was 
used 
(Human 
VEGF; 
BioSource 
Europe 
S.A., 
Nivelles, 
Belgium). 
The 
minimum 
VEGF 
concentration 
detected 
by 
this 
assay 
is 
5 
pg/mL. 
Intra-assay 
coefficients 
of 
variation 
are 
5.5% 
at 
87.4 
pg/mL, 
3.7% 
at 
345 
pg/mL 
and 
4.9% 
at

pg/mL. 


Data 
analysis 
and 
statistics 


Three 
groups 
of 
subjects 
were 
studied: 
(1) 
children 
with 
habitual 
snoring 
and 
AHIX5 
episodes/h8; 


(2) 
children 
with 
habitual 
snoring 
and 
AHIo5 
episodes/h; 
and 
(3) 
control 
subjects 
without 
snoring. 
There 
have 
been 
no 
previous 
studies 
in 
children 
with 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
reporting 
VEGF 
concentrations 
in 
plasma 
specimens. 
Therefore, 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
calculate 
the 
sample 
size 
that 
is 
required 
to 
detect 
a 
significant 
difference 
in 
VEGF 
levels 
between 
subjects 
with 
an 
AHIX5 
episodes/h 
and 
subjects 
with 
an 
AHIo5 
episodes/h. 
Overnight 
change 
in 
VEGF 
levels 
was 
defined 
as: 
morning 
plasma 
VEGF 
concentrationevening 
plasma 
VEGF 
concentration. 
Values 
below 
the 
lowest 
detection 
limit 
of 
the 
method 
(5 
pg/mL) 
were 
considered 
equal 
to 
2.5 
pg/mL. 
The 
Kruskal–Wallis 
test 
was 
applied 
to 
compare 
the 
three 
groups 
regarding 
continuous 
characteristics. 
Comparisons 
between 
groups 
for 
categorical 
characteristics 
were 
carried 
out 
by 
the 
w 
2-test 
(Yate’s 
correction). 


Spearman’s 
correlation 
was 
used 
to 
assess 
the 
association 
of 
morning 
VEGF 
values 
with 
body 
mass 
index 
and 
polysomnography 
indices. 
To 
adjust 
body 
mass 
index 
for 
the 
effect 
of 
age 
and 
gender, 
relative 
body 
mass 
index 
[(absolute 
value/value 
of 
50th 
percentile 
for 
age 
and 
gender) 
100] 
was 
calculated 
using 
standard 
growth 
curves.28 
To 
identify 
independent 
predictors 
of 
morning 
VEGF 
values, 
multiple 
linear 
regression 
analysis 
was 
performed 
(SPSS 
10.0; 
SPSS, 
Chicago, 
IL, 
USA). 
Morning 
VEGF 
values 
were 
log-transformed 
prior 
to 
the 
analysis 
so 
that 
they 
were 
normally 
distributed. 
Log-transformed 
morning 
VEGF 
concentration 
was 
the 
dependent 
variable 
and 
AHI 
(or 
% 
sleep 
time 
with 
oxygen 
saturation 
of 
hemoglobin 
less 
than 


90%), 
age, 
gender 
and 
relative 
body 
mass 
index 
were 
entered 
as 
independent 
variables.

Eighty-five 
children 
with 
and 
34 
children 
without

were 
invited 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
study. 
Parents 
of 
15 
children 
(eight 
snorers 
and 
seven 
non-

declined 
participation 
to 
the 
study 
and 
four 
more 
subjects 
(two 
snorers 
and 
two 
non-

were 
excluded 
due 
to 
symptoms 
of 
upper 
respiratory

infection. 
A 
total 
of 
100

were 
finally 
recruited 
in 
the 
study: 
20 
children 
with

No

VEGF 
values 
(P40:05) 
(Table

Persistent 
long-term 
increase 
of 
VEGF 
concentrations 
may 
be 
one 
of 
the 
factors 
participating 
in 
the 
process 
of 
atherogenesis 
and 
development 
of 
cardiovascular 
disease 
in 
subjects 
with 
obstructive

and

Nevertheless, 
increased

Serum 
VEGF

VEGF 
is 
a 
key 
regulator 
in 
angiogenesis, 
and 
hypoxia 
is 
a 
major 
stimulus 
for 
its 
synthesis.30,31

a 
significant

Gozal

reproduced

studies 
with 
adult 
participants

20 
children 
with 
obstructive

apnea 
(apnea

Children 
with

had 
higher 
morning

concentrations 
than 
controls 
with

episodes/h 
(n 
¼ 21) 
(2207112 
versus 
66723

VEGF 
levels 
were 
correlated 
with 
both 
respiratory 
disturbance 
index 
and 
duration 
of 
nocturnal 
hypoxemia, 
which 
is 
in 
contrast 
to 
our 
findings 
(absence 
of 
correlation 
with 
polysomnography 
indices).

Morning VEGF (pg/mL) 

When 
comparing 
the 
present 
report 
with 
the 
investigation 
by 
Gozal 
and 
colleagues,20 
mean 
(7SD) 
morning 
VEGF 
concentrations 
in 
children 
with 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
of 
the 
former 
study 
seem 
to 
be 
lower 
than 
VEGF 
levels 
in 
subjects 
of 
the 
latter 
study. 
These 
different 
values 
could 
be 
due 
at 
least 
partially 
to 
measuring 
plasma 
VEGF 
levels 
in 
the 
current 
study 
as 
opposed 
to 
measuring 
serum 
levels 
in 
the 
previous 
report.20,21 
More 
subjects 
were 
recruited 
in 
the 
present 
series 
than 
in 
the 
investigation 
by 
Gozal 
and 
colleagues 
(100 
versus 
41), 
whereas 
in 
both 
reports 
age 
and 
femaleto-
male 
ratio 
of 
participants 
were 
similar. 
Of 
note, 
children 
with 
snoring 
in 
the 
investigation 
by 
Gozal 
and 
colleagues 
had 
more 
severe 
and 
prolonged 
nocturnal 
hypoxemia. 
This 
study 
characteristic 
could 
possibly 
explain 
the 
difference 
in 
VEGF 
concentrations 
between 
subjects 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
and 
controls 
in 
the 
Gozal 
and 
colleagues 
report 
and 
the 
lack 
of 
such 
a 
difference 
between 
participants 
with 
AHIX5 
episodes/h 
and 
controls 
in 
the 
current 
study. 


No 
correlation 
was 
identified 
between 
morning 
VEGF 
levels 
and 
relative 
body 
mass 
index 
in 
this 
investigation 
and 
such 
a 
relationship 
was 
not 
described 
in 
the 
previously 
published 
pediatric 
report.20 
However, 
VEGF 
concentration 
was 
significantly 
related 
to 
body 
mass 
index 
in 
some,18,22 
but 
not 
all17 
reports 
including 
adults 
with 
sleep 
apnea. 


A 
potential 
limitation 
of 
the 
current 
study 
is 
that 
controls 
without 
snoring 
did 
not 
undergo 
polysomnography 
because 
this 
was 
not 
acceptable 
to 
the 
majority 
of 
parents. 
We 
cannot 
exclude 
the 
possibility 
that 
more 
participants 
had 
to 
be 
included 
for 
identifying 
a 
significant 
relationship 
between 
nocturnal 
hypoxemia 
and 
morning 
VEGF 
levels, 
although 
we 
recruited 
far 
more 
children 
compared 
to 
the 
study 
by 
Gozal 
and 
colleagues.20 


In 
conclusion, 
no 
significant 
association 
was 
identified 
between 
morning 
plasma 
VEGF 
levels 
and 
severity 
of 
obstructive 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
in 
children 
with 
habitual 
snoring. 
In 
accordance 
with 
findings 
in 
adults,22 
VEGF 
may 
not 
play 
an 
important 
pathophysiologic 
role 
in 
all 
cases 
of 
obstructive 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
in 
childhood.
