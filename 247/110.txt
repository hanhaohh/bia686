Objectives: 
To 
further 
validate 
a 
questionnaire 
about 
symptoms 
of 
childhood 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
(OSA) 
and 
to 
compare 
the 
questionnaire 
with 
polysomnography 
in 
their 
ability 
to 
predict 
outcomes 
of 
adenotonsillectomy. 


Design: 
Retrospective 
analysis 
of 
data 
from 
a 
longitudinal 
study. 


Setting: 
University-based 
sleep 
disorders 
laboratory. 


Participants: 
The 
Washtenaw 
County 
Adenotonsillectomy 
Cohort, 
comprising 
105 
children 
aged 
5.0 
to 
12.9 
years 
at 
entry. 


Intervention: 
Parents 
completed 
the 
22-item 
Sleep-
Related 
Breathing 
Disorder 
(SRBD) 
scale 
of 
the 
Pediatric 
Sleep 
Questionnaire, 
and 
children 
underwent 
polysomnography 
before 
and 
1 
year 
after 
clinically 
indicated 
adenotonsillectomy 
(n=78, 
usually 
for 
suspected 
OSA) 
or 
unrelated 
surgical 
care 
(n=27). 


Main 
Outcome 
Measures: 
Findings 
from 
commonly 
used 
hyperactivity 
ratings, 
attention 
tests, 
and 
sleepiness 
tests. 


Results: 
At 
baseline, 
a 
high 
SRBD 
scale 
score 
(1 
SD 
above 
the 
mean) 
predicted 
an 
approximately 
3-fold 
increased 
risk 
of 
OSA 
on 
polysomnography 
(odds 
ratio, 
2.80; 
95% 
confidence 
interval, 
1.68-4.68). 
One 
year 
later, 
OSA 
and 
symptoms 
had 
largely 
resolved, 
but 
a 
high 
SRBD 
score 
still 
predicted 
an 
approximately 
2-fold 
increased 
risk 
of 
residual 
OSA 
on 
polysomnography 
(odds 
ratio, 
1.89; 
95% 
confidence 
interval, 
1.13-3.18). 
Compared 
with 
several 
standard 
polysomnographic 
measures 
of 
OSA, 
the 
baseline 
SRBD 
scale 
better 
predicted 
initial 
hyperactivity 
ratings 
and 
1-year 
improvement, 
similarly 
predicted 
sleepiness 
and 
its 
improvement, 
and 
similarly 
failed 
to 
predict 
attention 
deficit 
or 
its 
improvement. 


Conclusions: 
The 
SRBD 
scale 
predicts 
polysomnographic 
results 
to 
an 
extent 
useful 
for 
research 
but 
not 
reliable 
enough 
for 
most 
individual 
patients. 
However, 
the 
SRBD 
scale 
may 
predict 
OSA-related 
neurobehavioral 
morbidity 
and 
its 
response 
to 
adenotonsillectomy 
as 
well 
or 
better 
than 
does 
polysomnography.

HE 
MOST 
PROMINENT 
MORbidities 
of 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
(OSA) 
in 
children 
include 
neurobehavioral 
deficits, 
such 
as 
inattention, 
hyperactivity, 
and 
daytime 
sleepiness.1 
In 
a 
cohort 
of 
children 
scheduled 
for 
clinically 
indicated 
adenotonsillectomy, 
our 
group2 
recently 
confirmed 
that 
OSA 
usually 
resolves 
and 
neurobehavioral 
deficits 
show 
prominent 
improvement 
1 
year 
after 
adenotonsillectomy. 
However, 
laboratory-
based 
polysomnographic 
measures 
of 
OSA 
showed 
only 
limited 
utility 
in 
predicting 
the 
extent 
of 
baseline 
neurobehavioral 
morbidity 
or 
its 
amelioration 
after 
surgery. 


The 
value 
of 
polysomnography 
before 
adenotonsillectomy 
is 
controversial. 
Sleep 
specialists 
and 
the 
American 
Academy 
of 
Pediatrics 
recommend 
objective 
testing, 
usually 
by 
means 
of 
nocturnal 
polysomnography, 
to 
confirm 
a 
diagnosis 
of 
OSA 
before 
it 
is 
treated 
by 
adenotonsillec


tomy.1 
In 
practice, 
however, 
only 
a 
small 
proportion 
of 
children 
who 
receive 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA 
undergo 
polysomnography 
before 
surgery,3 
and 
pediatric 
otolaryngology 
textbooks 
suggest 
that 
the 
diagnosis 
usually 
can 
be 
made 
with 
confidence 
at 
a 
clinic 
visit.4,5 
In 
a 
series 
of 
published 
studies, 
OSA 
symptoms 
repeatedly 
failed 
to 
predict 
polysomnographic 
findings.6 
However, 
these 
studies 
often 
relied 
on 
questionnaires 
with 
only 
a 
few 
items, 
and 
these 
often 
had 
not 
been 
adequately 
validated. 
Also, 
standard 
polysomnography 
can 
miss 
subtle 
forms 
of 
OSA 
that 
may 
be 
highly 
consequential 
for 
children.7,8 
No 
studies, 
to 
our 
knowledge, 
have 
ever 
used 
prediction 
of 
OSA-
related 
health 
outcomes, 
rather 
than 
polysomnographic 
results, 
as 
the 
standard 
by 
which 
to 
judge 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
symptoms 
as 
a 
tool 
in 
the 
diagnosis 
of 
clinically 
consequential 
pediatric 
OSA.9

Related 
Breathing 
Disorder 
(SRBD) 
scale 
of 
the 
Pediatric 
Sleep 
Questionnaire. 
In 
a 
comparison 
of 
sleep 
laboratory– 
referred 
children 
confirmed 
to 
have 
SRBDs 
and 
nonreferred 
children 
whose 
parents 
were 
surveyed 
in 
general 
pediatric 
waiting 
rooms, 
the 
SRBD 
scale 
showed 
a 
sensitivity 
of 
81% 
and 
a 
specificity 
of 
87%. 
Instrument 
performance 
did 
not 
vary 
with 
participant 
age 
(2-18 
years). 
The 
SRBD 
scale 
showed 
good 
internal 
consistency 
and 
test-retest 
reliability. 
Since 
then, 
the 
instrument 
has 
been 
used 
frequently 
to 
assess 
for 
OSA 
risk 
in 
research 
studies. 
One 
limitation 
of 
the 
original 
validity 
study, 
however, 
is 
that 
the 
nonreferred 
children 
were 
not 
tested 
to 
confirm 
the 
assumption 
that 
they 
had 
no 
SRBDs. 
Furthermore, 
the 
validity 
of 
the 
SRBD 
scale 
in 
clinical 
practice, 
outside 
a 
sleep 
laboratory, 
remains 
untested. 


We 
therefore 
took 
advantage 
of 
detailed 
diagnostic 
and 
outcome 
data 
available 
from 
the 
Washtenaw 
County 
Adenotonsillectomy 
Cohort 
to 
perform 
a 
retrospective 
revalidation 
of 
the 
SRBD 
scale. 
We 
also 
tested 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
this 
scale 
vs 
polysomnography 
in 
the 
prediction 
of 
OSA-
related, 
treatment-responsive 
neurobehavioral 
morbidity. 


METHODS
SUBJECTS 


The 
Washtenaw 
County 
Adenotonsillectomy 
Cohort 
enrolled 
children 
aged 
5.0 
to 
12.9 
years 
after 
informed 
consent 
and 
assent 
were 
obtained 
for 
this 
institutional 
review 
board– 
approved 
study.2,11-13 
Patients 
and 
controls 
were 
scheduled 
for 
adenotonsillectomy 
and 
unrelated 
surgical 
care, 
respectively; 
had 
no 
clinical 
need 
for 
polysomnography 
according 
to 
the 
treating 
otolaryngologists; 
and 
had 
no 
medical 
conditions 
that 
might 
complicate 
the 
interpretation 
of 
sleep 
and 
behavioral 
test 
results. 
The 
adenotonsillectomy 
was 
for 
any 
clinical 
indication, 
but 
in 
almost 
all 
the 
patients 
(91%), 
nocturnal 
airway 
obstruction 
was 
suspected 
at 
the 
otolaryngologist’s 
office. 


The 
105 
individuals 
in 
the 
completed 
cohort 
had 
a 
mean±SD 
age 
of 
8.4±1.9 
years, 
and 
60 
(57%) 
were 
boys. 
Of 
the 
105 
subjects, 
78 
were 
scheduled 
for 
adenotonsillectomy 
and 
27 
for 
other 
surgical 
care. 
Comparisons 
between 
participants 
and 
nonparticipants 
for 
whom 
some 
data 
could 
be 
obtained 
revealed 
no 
significant 
differences 
in 
demographics, 
socioeconomic 
status, 
or 
snoring 
frequency, 
but 
participants 
were 
older 
(1 
year) 
than 
nonparticipants.2 
Similarly, 
comparisons 
between 
patients 
undergoing 
adenotonsillectomy 
and 
control 
subjects 
revealed 
no 
significant 
differences 
in 
sex, 
race, 
body 
mass 
index, 
or 
socioeconomic 
status, 
but 
patients 
receiving 
adenotonsillectomy 
were 
1.2 
years 
younger 
on 
average. 
Of 
the 
105 
subjects 
who 
enrolled 
at 
baseline, 
100 
(95%) 
returned 
for 
follow-up 
testing 
1 
year 
later. 


POLYSOMNOGRAPHY 


Polysomnography 
included 
all 
standard 
electroencephalographic, 
electro-oculographic, 
and 
electromyographic 
leads 
required 
to 
score 
sleep 
stages.14 
Equipment 
used 
to 
monitor 
breathing 
included 
oronasal 
thermocouples, 
piezoelectric 
strain 
gauges, 
finger 
oximetry, 
end-tidal 
carbon 
dioxide, 
and 
a 
thin, 
water-
filled 
esophageal 
catheter 
previously 
shown 
to 
have 
a 
negligible 
effect 
on 
sleep 
in 
children.15,16 
A 
minority 
of 
the 
children 
did 
not 
tolerate 
esophageal 
pressure 
monitoring 
for 
at 
least 
2 
hours, 
and 
their 
esophageal 
pressure 
data 
were 
considered 
missing.12 


After 
each 
polysomnogram, 
a 
Multiple 
Sleep 
Latency 
Test 
was 
performed. 
This 
test 
included 
four 
or 
five 
20-minute 
nap 


attempts 
at 
2-hour 
intervals.17 
The 
mean 
sleep 
latency 
across 
these 
nap 
attempts 
is 
often 
considered 
to 
be 
a 
gold 
standard 
objective 
test 
for 
daytime 
sleepiness, 
and 
the 
test 
is 
sensitive 
to 
sleepiness 
in 
patients 
with 
OSA 
as 
young 
as 
3 
years 
old.18 


Polysomnograms 
and 
Multiple 
Sleep 
Latency 
Tests 
were 
scored 
by 
a 
single 
registered 
polysomnographic 
technologist 
masked 
to 
the 
clinical 
status 
of 
the 
subjects. 
Polysomnographic 
OSA 
measures 
included 
a 
pediatric 
obstructive 
apnea 
index 
(2-breath 
or 
longer 
events 
per 
hour 
of 
sleep), 
an 
apnea/ 
hypopnea 
index 
(where 
hypopneas 
lasted 
2 
breath 
cycles), 
a 
respiratory 
disturbance 
index 
(which 
included 
apneas, 
hypopneas, 
and 
respiratory 
event–related 
arousals 
determined 
by 
esophageal 
pressure 
monitoring), 
minimum 
oxygen 
saturation, 
an 
electroencephalographic 
arousal 
index, 
and 
percentage 
of 
sleep 
time 
with 
an 
end-tidal 
carbon 
dioxide 
level 
greater 
than 
50 
mm 
Hg. 
Obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
was 
considered 
present 
when 
the 
obstructive 
apnea 
index 
was 
1 
or 
more.19 
Of 
the 
78 
patients 
undergoing 
adenotonsillectomy 
and 
27 
control 
subjects, 
40 
and 
1, 
respectively, 
met 
this 
criterion 
for 
OSA. 
The 
mean±SD 
apnea/hypopnea 
index 
was 
5.7±11.1 
for 
the 
entire 
sample: 
13.1±15.3 
for 
the 
adenotonsillectomy 
group 
with 
OSA, 
1.2±1.1 
for 
the 
adenotonsillectomy 
group 
without 
OSA, 
and 
1.2±1.9 
for 
controls. 


SRBD 
SCALE 
OF 
THE 
PEDIATRIC 
SLEEP 
QUESTIONNAIRE 


The 
SRBD 
scale 
contains 
22 
symptom 
items 
that 
ask 
about 
snoring 
frequency, 
loud 
snoring, 
observed 
apneas, 
difficulty 
breathing 
during 
sleep, 
daytime 
sleepiness, 
inattentive 
or 
hyperactive 
behavior, 
and 
other 
pediatric 
OSA 
features, 
each 
previously 
shown 
to 
correlate 
with 
polysomnographically 
confirmed 
OSA 
in 
referred 
children.10 
Responses 
are 
“yes”=1, 
“no”=0, 
and 
“don’t 
know”=missing. 
The 
mean 
response 
on 
nonmissing 
items 
is 
the 
score, 
which 
can 
vary 
from 
0 
to 
1. 
Previous 
data 
suggest 
that 
a 
cutoff 
value 
of 
0.33 
would 
be 
most 
effective 
in 
identifying 
pediatric 
OSA. 
Subscales 
within 
the 
SRBD 
scale 
include 
a 
4-item 
sleepiness 
scale, 
a 
4-item 
snoring 
scale, 
and 
a 
6-item 
inattention/
hyperactivity 
scale 
derived 
originally 
from 
the 
Diagnostic 
and 
Statistical 
Manual 
of 
Mental 
Disorders, 
Fourth 
Edition 
(DSM-IV) 
criteria 
for 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder 
(ADHD).20 


BEHAVIORAL 
AND 
COGNITIVE 
TESTING 


Parents 
completed 
the 
Child 
Symptom 
Inventory-4: 
Parent 
Checklist 
to 
generate 
a 
T-score 
(mean±SD, 
50±10) 
for 
inattention 
and 
hyperactivity.21 
The 
well-validated 
Child 
Symptom 
Inventory 
contains 
108 
items 
that 
screen 
children 
aged 
5 
to 
12 
years 
for 
a 
variety 
of 
emotional 
and 
behavioral 
disorders 
based 
on 
the 
DSM-IV. 


An 
objective 
score 
for 
sustained 
attention 
was 
provided 
by 
the 
standard 
score 
(mean±SD, 
100±15) 
on 
the 
Integrated 
Visual 
and 
Auditory 
Continuous 
Performance 
Test, 
administered 
using 
a 
personal 
computer.22,23 
The 
child 
hears 
or 
sees 
“1” 
or 
“2” 
on 
the 
screen 
and 
clicks 
a 
mouse 
button 
only 
in 
response 
to 
“1.” 
The 
main 
testing 
period 
consists 
of 
500 
trials, 


1.5 
seconds 
each, 
in 
which 
the 
visual 
or 
auditory 
stimuli 
are 
presented 
briefly 
in 
a 
pseudorandom 
pattern. 
The 
number 
of 
omissions, 
as 
reflected 
by 
the 
Full 
Scale 
Attention 
Quotient, 
was 
used 
to 
generate 
the 
measure 
of 
attention 
for 
this 
analysis. 
STATISTICAL 
ANALYSIS 


Data 
were 
double-entered 
professionally 
to 
verify 
accuracy. 
Means 
and 
standard 
deviations 
were 
used 
as 
summary 
measures, 
and 
medians 
were 
also 
computed 
for 
the 
SRBD 
scores.

RESULTS
VALIDATION 
OF 
THE 
SRBD 
SCALE 


At 
baseline 
the 
mean±SD 
SRBD 
score 
from 
the 
Pediatric 
Sleep 
Questionnaire 
was 
0.31±0.21, 
and 
the 
median 
score 
was 
0.32. 
In 
41 
subjects 
with 
OSA 
on 
polysomnography, 
the 
mean±SD 
SRBD 
score 
was 
0.43±0.15, 
whereas 
in 
64 
subjects 
without 
OSA, 
the 
score 
was 
0.24±0.21. 
A 
previously 
established 
cutoff 
value 
(SRBD 
score 
0.3310), 
applied 
to 
the 
entire 
sample, 
showed 
a 
sensitivity 
of 
78% 
and 
a 
specificity 
of 
72% 
for 
polysomnographically 
defined 
OSA 
(2=25.0; 
P.001); 
74% 
of 
the 
subjects 
were 
classified 
correctly. 
Correlations 
of 
low 
to 
moderate 
strength 
between 
the 
SRBD 
score 
and 
each 
polysomnographic 
measure 
all 
reached 
significance 
except 
for 
the 
percentage 
of 
sleep 
time 
with 
an 
end-tidal 


carbon 
dioxide 
level 
greater 
than 
50 
mm 
Hg, 
which 
showed 
a 
trend 
(Table 
1). 


A 
logistic 
regression 
model 
showed 
that 
a 
1-SD 
increase 
in 
the 
normalized 
SRBD 
score 
predicted 
nearly 
a 
3-fold 
increased 
risk 
of 
the 
presence 
of 
OSA 
on 
polysomnography 
(odds 
ratio, 
2.80; 
95% 
confidence 
interval, 
1.68-4.68). 
Even 
among 
the 
78 
children 
scheduled 
for 
adenotonsillectomy, 
almost 
all 
(91%) 
for 
suspected 
SRBDs, 
the 
SRBD 
score 
identified 
nearly 
a 
2-fold 
increased 
risk 
for 
presence 
of 
OSA 
on 
polysomnography 
(odds 
ratio, 
1.84; 
95% 
confidence 
interval, 
1.043.25). 


At 
1-year 
follow-up, 
the 
mean±SD 
SRBD 
score 
was 
0.15±0.15, 
and 
the 
median 
score 
was 
0.10. 
Among 
12 
subjects 
(8 
after 
adenotonsillectomy) 
who 
had 
polysomnographic 
evidence 
of 
OSA 
at 
follow-up, 
the 
mean±SD 
SRBD 
score 
was 
0.26±0.21, 
whereas 
among 
children 
without 
OSA, 
the 
score 
was 
0.14±0.14. 
Sensitivity 
of 
a 
positive 
SRBD 
score 
for 
OSA 
on 
polysomnography 
was 
42% 
and 
specificity 
was 
90% 
(Fisher 
exact 
test 
P=.01), 
and 
84% 
of 
all 
subjects 
were 
correctly 
classified. 
Correlations 
between 
the 
SRBD 
score 
and 
individual 
polysomnographic 
measures 
were 
not 
significant 
(Table 
1), 
but 
a 
logistic 
regression 
model 
showed 
that 
a 
1-SD 
increase 
in 
the 
SRBD 
score 
at 
follow-up 
still 
predicted 
nearly 
a 
2-fold 
increased 
risk 
of 
residual 
OSA 
on 
the 
polysomnogram 
(odds 
ratio, 
1.89; 
95% 
confidence 
interval,

Table

correlations 
between

both 
the

scale 
(upper

polysomnographic

panel). 
Correlations 
for 
subscale 
components 
of 
the

assessment 
of 
which 
portions 
of 
the 
SRBD 
scale 
contributed 
most 
to 
associations 
with 
neurobehavioral 
measures. 
The 
SRBD 
scale 
showed 
a 
strong 
correlation 
with 
the 
ADHD 
scale, 
mainly 
because 
of 
the 
inattention/ 
hyperactivity 
subscale 
within 
the 
SRBD 
scale. 
However, 
correlations 
between 
polysomnographic 
measures 
and 
ADHD 
symptoms 
were 
comparatively 
low; 
for 
example, 
each 
was 
lower 
than 
the 
correlation 
between 
the 
snoring 
subscale, 
which 
contains 
no 
items 
about 
daytime 
behavior, 
and 
the 
ADHD 
scale. 
In 
contrast, 
no 
SRBD 
scale 
or 
polysomnographic 
variable 
correlated 
significantly 
with 
the 
attention 
quotient. 
Mean

obstructive

COMMENT
This 
study 
of 
5-to 
12-year-old 
children, 
before 
and 
1 
year 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
or 
unrelated 
surgical 
care, 
confirms 
the 
validity 
of 
the 
SRBD 
scale 
by 
comparison 
with 
polysomnographic 
findings. 
Furthermore, 
the 
data 
suggest 
for 
the 
first 
time 
that 
if 
the 
goal 
is 
prediction 
of 
clinically 
relevant 
neurobehavioral 
health 
outcomes 
rather 
than 
sleep 
laboratory 
findings, 
the 
1-page 
SRBD 
questionnaire 
provides 
as 
much 
or 
more 
clinical 
utility 
than 
does 
the 
more 
elaborate 
polysomnogram. 
This 
analysis 
was 
performed 
retrospectively 
in 
a 
cohort 
assembled 
primarily 
to 
study 
neurobehavioral 
effects 
of 
SRBDs, 
and 
other 
important 
health 
effects, 
such 
as 
those 
on 
the 
cardiovascular 
system, 
were 
not 
studied. 
However, 
if 
the 
current 
findings 
can 
be 
confirmed 
prospectively 
and 
with 
respect 
to 
other 
outcomes, 
then 
the 
impact 
on 
the 
diagnosis 
and 
management 
of 
OSA 
in 
children 
could 
be 
substantial.

The 
criterion 
validity 
that 
we 
demonstrate 
for 
the 
SRBD 
scale 
supports 
its 
usefulness 
in 
clinical 
research. 
A 
growing 
number 
of 
investigations 
have 
used 
the 
SRBD 
scale— 
at 
least 
8 
studies 
in 
2004 
and 
2005 
alone25-32—and 
the 
present 
data 
support 
its 
effectiveness 
as 
a 
screen 
to 
identify 
children 
at 
high 
or 
low 
risk 
for 
OSA. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
our 
findings 
also 
demonstrate 
that 
even 
a 
comparatively 
detailed 
questionnaire 
is 
unlikely 
to 
replicate 
polysomnographic 
data 
reliably 
enough 
for 
individual 
patients 
in 
clinical 
settings.

specificity 
of 
the 
dichotomized 
SRBD 
score 
were 
78% 
and 
72%, 
respectively, 
in 
the 
entire 
sample. 
These 
results 
suggest 
some 
utility 
as 
a 
simple 
adjunct 
assessment 
during 
otolaryngology 
office 
visits: 
almost 
all 
(91%) 
of 
the 
78 
patients 
who 
underwent 
adenotonsillectomy 
were 
suspected 
to 
have 
OSA 
based 
on 
their 
clinical 
evaluations, 
whereas 
only 
40 
(51%) 
in 
fact 
showed 
OSA 
on 
polysomnography.2 
This 
suggests 
an 
otolaryngologist 
office 
visit 
diagnostic 
sensitivity 
of 
95% 
but 
a 
specificity 
of 
only 
13%. 
These 
numbers 
could 
have 
been 
different 
if 
we 
had 
had 
an 
opportunity 
to 
study 
otolaryngologists’ 
patients 
who 
were 
not 
scheduled 
for 
adenotonsillectomy 
in 
addition 
to 
those 
who 
were. 
However, 
the 
results 
raise 
the 
possibility 
that 
the 
SRBD 
scale 
might 
help 
otolaryngologists 
improve 
the 
specificity 
(and 
associated 
positive 
predictive 
value) 
of 
their 
office-based 
evaluations, 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
they 
seek 
to 
predict 
polysomnographic 
results. 


Polysomnography, 
however, 
is 
an 
imperfect 
gold 
standard 
when 
it 
comes 
to 
predicting 
either 
neurobehavioral 
morbidity 
believed 
to 
arise 
from 
OSA 
or 
response 
to 
treatment. 
Whereas 
numerous 
studies33-37 
have 
shown 
that 
snoring 
predicts 
adverse 
neurobehavioral 
outcomes 
in 
children, 
many 
studies29,36-42 
also 
have 
failed 
to 
find 
correlations 
between 
those 
outcomes 
and 
polysomnographic 
findings. 
Snoring 
itself, 
or 
some 
other 
feature 
of 
OSA 
that 
is 
not 
well 
quantified 
on 
standard 
polysomnography, 
may 
play 
an 
important 
role 
in 
the 
pathogenesis 
of 
associated 
cognitive 
and 
behavioral 
morbidity. 
Examples 
of 
technical 
approaches 
under 
investigation, 
with 
promise 
that 
they 
might 
improve 
the 
predictive 
value 
of 
polysomnography, 
include 
analyses 
of 
esophageal 
pressure 
recordings,43 
respiratory 
cycle–related 
electroencephalographic 
changes,11 
the 
ratio 
of 
respiratory 
to 
non-
respiratory 
arousals,44 
and 
the 
cyclic 
alternating 
pattern.25 


These 
observations 
also 
raise 
an 
important 
possibility 
that 
has 
not, 
to 
our 
knowledge, 
been 
tested 
previously. 
Apart 
from 
the 
unique 
ability 
of 
polysomnography 
to 
record 
and 
illuminate 
known 
pathophysiologic 
features, 
could 
a 
child’s 
symptoms, 
determined 
by 
interview 
or 
questionnaire, 
provide 
predictive 
value 
beyond 
that 
of 
polysomnography 
in 
a 
clinical 
setting? 
The 
present 
results 
suggest 
that 
the 
answer 
may 
be 
yes. 
Conversely, 
these 
findings 
did 
not 
generally 
demonstrate 
added 
value 
of 
polysomnography 
after 
the 
SRBD 
scale 
was 
taken 
into 
account. 


Part 
of 
the 
reason 
that 
the 
SRBD 
scale 
proved 
effective 
in 
predicting 
cross-sectional 
morbidity 
may 
be 
that 
some 
parents 
probably 
tend 
to 
rate 
their 
children 
high, 
in 
a 
nonspecific 
manner, 
for 
any 
pathologic 
finding. 
This 
could 
explain, 
in 
part, 
the 
correlations 
between 
the 
SRBD 
scale 
or 
its 
components 
and 
the 
ADHD 
scale, 
which 
is 
also 
a 
parent 
rating. 
In 
contrast, 
no 
significant 
correla


tion 
emerged 
between 
the 
SRBD 
scale 
and 
the 
attention 
quotient, 
which 
is 
derived 
from 
an 
objective 
continuous 
performance 
task. 
However, 
the 
SRBD 
scale 
did 
correlate 
with 
results 
on 
the 
Multiple 
Sleep 
Latency 
Test, 
which 
also 
is 
an 
objective 
test. 
Even 
if 
the 
predictive 
value 
of 
the 
SRBD 
scale 
derives 
in 
part 
from 
subjective 
parent 
impressions, 
and 
also 
from 
item 
overlap 
with 
the 
behavioral 
rating 
instrument, 
the 
SRBD 
scale 
likely 
captures 
the 
impact 
of 
disruptive 
behavior 
on 
affected 
families, 
information 
that 
reasonably 
might 
contribute 
to 
a 
treatment 
decision. 


The 
present 
data 
derive 
from 
a 
unique, 
intensively 
studied 
cohort 
of 
children. 
The 
findings 
are 
limited, 
nonetheless, 
by 
the 
nonrandomized 
design, 
the 
retrospective 
nature 
of 
the 
analysis, 
and 
the 
lack 
of 
additional 
OSA-
related 
outcome 
measures. 
For 
example, 
the 
relative 
extent 
to 
which 
the 
SRBD 
scale 
and 
polysomnography 
may 
predict 
children’s 
systemic 
hypertension, 
pulmonary 
hypertension, 
growth 
impairment, 
quality 
of 
life, 
or 
responses 
of 
these 
morbidities 
to 
treatment 
remains 
untested. 
Preoperative 
polysomnography 
also 
may 
serve 
important 
purposes 
other 
than 
to 
diagnose 
OSA, 
for 
example, 
to 
screen 
for 
severe 
OSA 
that 
raises 
risks 
of 
perioperative 
adenotonsillectomy 
complications.45 
For 
these 
reasons, 
we 
cannot 
conclude 
that 
the 
SRBD 
scale 
is 
an 
adequate 
substitute 
for 
polysomnography 
in 
clinical 
practice. 
However, 
the 
present 
findings 
should 
stimulate 
new 
prospective 
studies 
of 
OSA 
and 
adenotonsillectomy 
outcomes 
in 
relation 
to 
both 
polysomnographic 
and 
simpler 
assessment 
methods. 
Nocturnal 
polysomnography 
is 
expensive, 
time-consuming, 
and 
sometimes 
unavailable 
in 
a 
timely 
manner. 
The 
diagnostic 
added 
value 
of 
polysomnography—over 
that 
provided 
by 
a 
simple, 
1-page 
symptom 
inventory 
or 
a 
good 
history 
and 
physical 
examination—
should 
be 
clearly 
demonstrated. 
If 
this 
added 
value 
cannot 
be 
verified, 
then 
recommendations 
for 
objective 
testing 
before 
adenotonsillectomy, 
to 
confirm 
treatable 
OSA 
and 
distinguish 
it 
from 
primary 
snoring,1 
may 
deserve 
reassessment. 
Persistence 
of 
OSA 
in 
a 
significant 
number 
of 
children 
after 
adenotonsillectomy,46 
combined 
at 
that 
point 
with 
reduced 
sensitivity 
of 
a 
symptom-
based 
diagnosis, 
as 
suggested 
by 
the 
present 
data, 
argues 
that 
polysomnography 
may 
prove 
more 
important 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
than 
before.
