Symptoms of sleep disturbances among children 
at two general pediatric clinics 

Objective: We assessed the frequency of childhood sleep problems at 2 
general pediatric clinics. 
Study design: Parents of 1038 unselected children (554 boys) aged 2.0 to 

13.9 years completed a validated Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire while waiting 
for appointments. 
Results: Habitual snoring was reported in 176 (17%) of the children. Criterion 
scores suggestive of sleep-disordered breathing were found in 115 (11%) 
of the children, in 29% of children at the clinic for neurologic indications, and 
in 21% of children at the clinic for noninfectious respiratory indications. Insomnia 
(ie, unrefreshing sleep or difficulty with sleep onset, sleep maintenance, 
or early morning awakening from sleep) was reported in 430 (41%) of 
the children; =2 symptoms were present in 191 (18%) of the children. Excessive 
daytime sleepiness was suggested in 148 (14%) of the children, and 390 
(38%) had symptoms of sleep terrors, sleepwalking, or nocturnal bruxism. 

Conclusions: Sleep problems such as sleep-disordered breathing, insomnia, 
excessive sleepiness, and parasomnias are frequent among children seen at 
general pediatric practices. (J Pediatr 2002;140:97-102)

sleep apnea syndrome is estimated to affect 
1% to 3% of children,4,7 upper airway 
resistance syndrome may affect 
many more,8 and evidence suggests that 
significant sleep disturbance may occur 
in up to 43% of children.9-11 Parasomnias 
such as sleep terrors, sleepwalking, 
and nocturnal bruxism are also common 
among children.10,12 Insomnia affects 
approximately 17% of children 
aged 3 to 14 years.13 However, these estimates 
of prevalence are derived mainly 
from school or community samples. 

PSQ Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire 
SDB Sleep-disordered breathing 


To assess the frequency of sleep-related 
problems in 2 community-based general 
pediatric practices, we administered 
a validated Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire 
(PSQ)14 to parents and their children 
in waiting rooms. 

METHODS 

Patients 

Between February 5, 1998, and May 
1, 2000, parents and children (aged 2.0


13.9 years) were recruited while they 
waited for a general pediatrics appointment. 
Research assistants attempted to 
approach all child-parent pairs at the 
clinics on designated days. Inclusion 
criteria, designed to impose few restrictions 
and maximize generalizability of 
findings, were (1) the presence of a parent 
or guardian who was able to read 
and write, (2) the absence of any current 
treatment or previous surgery for a 
sleep disorder, (3) the absence of severe 
mental or physical impairment (eg, 
cerebral palsy) that limits PSQ applica

and item responses provided on 
the PSQ), and (4) the absence of a sibling 
already enrolled in the study. Participating 
parents provided informed 
consent and children older than 8 years 
or able to understand the study gave 
written assent. With encouragement to 
seek the child’s help as needed, each 
parent completed the PSQ, which required 
20 minutes on average. 

Both clinics are owned by a large 
public university health system. Clinic 
A is staffed by 5 full time faculty physicians. 
Clinic B was recently bought by 
the university without substantial 

change in physician staff, which includes 
4 pediatricians. The clinic population 
at both sites is primarily 
community-based. Although socioeconomic 
data were not collected in the 
current study, the 2 clinics serve patients 
from a broad background. The 
university owns a large health care 
maintenance organization and this, or 
similar organizations, account for approximately 
53% of all visits to clinic A 
and 44% of all visits to clinic B. Commercial 
insurance carriers cover approximately 
38% and 34% of visits to 
each clinic, respectively, and Medicaid 
covers 3% of visits at each clinic. Insur


ance coverage for most of the remaining 
visits is unknown. 

The PSQ contains more than 70 
close-ended questions to which parents 
answer “yes,” “no,” or “don’t know” 
(Appendix), and several open-ended 
questions that elicit a medical history.14 
Most questions ask about current 
symptoms aside from those that may 
have appeared only with recent acute 
illnesses. Three items about rare but 
significant symptoms (witnessed apneas, 
sleep terrors, or sleepwalking) ask 
whether they have “ever” occurred. The 
PSQ items that reflect sleep problems 
best assessed by polysomnography

time 
sleepiness, and daytime disruptive 
behavior that can be a manifestation of 
a sleep disorder. A composite 22-item 
SDB subscale showed a sensitivity of 

0.81 and a specificity of 0.87 and classified 
85% of patients correctly in a sample 
of controls and children with 
polysomnographically-defined SDB. 
Reliability was also good. Other PSQ 
items reflect sleep problems that are 
usually evaluated by history (eg, insomnia 
and parasomnias) and cannot be 
validated as readily against polysomnography, 
but they are worded to maximize 
face validity. Specifically, the PSQ 
asks about insomnia (unrefreshing 
sleep or difficulty with sleep onset, sleep 
maintenance, or early morning awakenings), 
sleep terrors, sleepwalking, and 
nocturnal bruxism (Appendix). The 
PSQ also addresses sleep-related behavioral 
issues, such as bedtime resistance 
and sleep hygiene. 
Indications for Visits 

The medical information provided on 
the PSQ was used to classify the main 
reason for the current pediatrics visit 
into 1 of 13 categories: well-child or immunization, 
respiratory–infectious, respiratory–
noninfectious, cardiovascular, 
developmental/psychiatric, neurologic 
problems, nonrespiratory infection, injury 
or pains, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, 
allergies, other, or no reason 
listed. Categories were used, rather 
than specific diagnoses, in part because 
many parents answered open-ended 
questionnaire inquiries in terms that, although 
classifiable, carried less specificity 
than medical diagnoses often 
imply. Categorization was performed 
by one of the authors (K. M. H., a 
nurse). Upper respiratory tract infections, 
pharyngitis, and otitis media were 
all included as “respiratory–infectious,” 
whereas other respiratory conditions, 
such as asthma, were coded as “respiratory–
noninfectious.” Headaches were 
coded under “neurologic problems,” 

and stomachaches or pains were coded 
as “gastrointestinal.” Use of methylphenidate 
or prior diagnoses of attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder were 
coded under “developmental/psychiatric.” 
When more than one reason for 
a visit was listed, the first mentioned 
was considered the main one. Nonspecific 
labels of “follow-up visit” or 
“reevaluation of medication” were 
coded under “other.” Categorization of 
sometimes scant notations made by parents 
can be difficult, so to assess reliability, 
another author (R. D. C.) 
independently categorized 50 randomly 
chosen patients: 46 (92%) of the children 
were again placed into the originally 
assigned category. 

Analysis 

Data were summarized by frequencies, 
95% CIs, and means ± SD, as applicable. 
Children were stratified into 4 
age groups for several analyses: 
preschool, 2.0 to 4.9 years, n = 399 
(38%); early elementary, 5.0 to 7.9 
years, n = 286 (28%); late elementary, 

8.0 to 10.9 years, n = 213 (21%); and 
middle school, 11 to 13.9 years, n = 140 
(14%). “Don’t know” responses were 
counted as missing data. All statistical 
tests were performed with the .2 test, or 
logistic regression models when necessary 
to control for potential confounding 
factors. The significance level was 
set at P < .05. Analyses were performed 
with SPSS software, version 8.0 
(SPSS, Chicago, Ill). 
RESULTS 

Patients 

Parents of approximately 1400 children 
were approached and 1038 questionnaires 
were completed: 328 in the 
winter, 292 in the spring, 114 in the 
summer, and 304 in the fall. The mean 
subject age was 6.7 ± 3.2 years, 554 
(53.4%) of the patients were boys, and 
484 (46.6%) were girls. Reported racial 
and ethnic backgrounds were 606 
(58.4%) white, 201 (19.4%) African 
American, 59 (5.7%) Asian-American, 

16 (1.5%) Hispanic, 5 (0.5%) American 
Indian, and 151 (14.5%) other or 
unknown. Proportions of white and 
nonwhite children did not differ significantly 
by sex or by age (P > .05). 

Sleep-Disordered Breathing 

Habitual snoring, defined as snoring 
more than half the time while asleep, was 
reported in 176 (17.1%, 95% CI [14.7, 
19.2]) of the children. The mean SDB 
score for the sample was 0.15 (ie, 15% of 
subscale items positive, 95% CI [0.14, 
0.16]). A score suggestive of SDB 
(=0.33)14 was found in 1 out of every 9 
children (Table I), and more boys than 
girls had SDB scores =0.33 (Figure). 
Positive SDB scores were reported in 
similar proportions of each age group 
(Table II). A positive response to the 
PSQ item about excessive weight was associated 
with a high SDB score: among 
53 overweight children, 14 (26.4%) had 
high SDB scores, whereas among 
nonoverweight children, only 98 (10.2%) 
had similarly high scores (P < .001). A 
positive response to the PSQ item about 
bruxism was also associated with a high 
SDB score: among 300 bruxers, 48 
(16.0%) had high SDB scores, whereas 
among 738 nonbruxers, only 67 (9.1%) 
had similarly high scores (P = .001). 

Sleepiness 

Excessive daytime sleepiness, defined 
as the presence of =2 of 4 symptoms, 
was reported in 1 of every 6 to 7 children, 
and this frequency did not vary 
significantly with sex (Figure). Problems 
with sleepiness were reported only 
about half as often in preschool children 
as in older children (Table II). Excessive 
sleepiness was associated with habitual 
snoring, which was present in 51 
(29.0%) of 162 children with reported 
sleepiness, but only 111 (12.9%) of 875 
remaining children (P < .001). 

Parasomnias 

Symptoms of sleepwalking, sleep terrors, 
and nocturnal bruxism were each 
reported by parents in 15% to 29% of 
the children (Figure, Table I). Sex

showed no association with sleep terrors, 
but more boys than girls had symptoms 
of sleepwalking and bruxism 
(Figure). Preschool–aged children, 
compared with other children, had 
sleepwalking less frequently and had 
sleep terrors more frequently (Table II). 
Middle school–aged children had bruxism 
less frequently (Table II). 

Insomnia 

Significant insomnia, defined by =2 of 
4 insomnia symptoms, was present in 
nearly 1 in 5 children (Table I). No sex 
differences were found in the entire 
sample or within age groups (P > .10 
within each group) (Figure). One insomnia 
symptom was present in 430 
(41.4%) of the children. Significant insomnia 
was reported less often among 
early elementary school-aged children 
than among other age groups (Table II). 

Bedtime Resistance 

Bedtime resistance was reported in 1 
of every 4 patients (Table I), and no sex 

differences were found (Figure). Middle 
school children, compared with 
other age groups, were least often reported 
to have resistant behavior at 
bedtime (Table II). Bedtime resistance 
occurred in 63 (55.3%) of 114 children 
with high SDB scores but in only 197 
(21.7%) of 908 remaining children (P < 
.001). 

Reason for Visit 

The frequency of each main reason for 
visits to the pediatrician is shown in 
Table I. Children at the clinic for neurologic 
problems usually had headaches 
(85%) or seizure disorders (15%). Logistic 
regression analyses that controlled 
for age, sex, and ethnicity showed that 
positive SDB scores were more common 
in comparison to with children at 
the clinic for well-child care or immunizations, 
among children at the clinic 
for neurologic problems (P = .03), noninfectious 
respiratory problems (P = 
.04), or no listed reason (P = .01). Similar 
logistic regression analyses showed 

THE JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS 
JANUARY 2002 

that children with neurologic problems, 
compared with well children, more frequently 
had sleepwalking (P = .02). 
Children at the clinic for nonrespiratory 
infections were more likely than well 
children to have bruxism (P = .008). 

DISCUSSION 

The results of this observational study 
of 1038 general pediatric outpatients 
suggest that several sleep-related 
problems are highly prevalent in this 
population. Published frequencies of 
childhood obstructive sleep apnea 
range from 1% to 3% but are largely 
based on questionnaire data7 or relatively 
insensitive recording techniques.4 
No estimates of the number of children 
with upper airway resistance syndrome 
are available. The PSQ probably identified 
many children with each type of 
SDB,14 but the 11% frequency of positive 
SDB scores in our patients still suggests 
that SDB may be particularly 
prevalent among sick children who attend 
general pediatric clinics. The frequency 
of habitual snoring (17%) was 
higher than the 7% to 12% reported in 
epidemiologic studies.4,15,16 Only 5% of 
our patients at the clinics for well-child 
care or immunizations had positive 
SDB scores, whereas children with active 
problems more often had positive 
screens, probably because SDB is associated 
with other conditions that bring 
children to their pediatricians. For example, 
in our sample the neurologic indications 
for visits were headaches 
(85%) or epilepsy (15%); both are associated 
with SDB, at least in adults, and 
tend to improve when SDB is treated.
17,18 Asthma and chronic nasal obstruction 
also each carry increased risk 
for SDB.19,20 

The frequency of problem sleepiness 
in children is unknown. Teenagers with 
increasingly busy schedules spend little 
time in bed and are likely to be sleep deprived, 
but our data suggest that increases 
in sleepiness may begin much 
sooner than the teenage years. Conse

that could adversely affect school performance.
21 

Our data suggest that sleep terrors 
are most common in preschool-aged 
children and less common at older ages, 
whereas sleepwalking is least common 
in the youngest children; 39% of 
preschool children were observed to 
wake up screaming during the night, 
and 19% of elementary school-aged 
children had episodes of sleepwalking. 
High rates were also reported recently 
among randomly selected school children 
in Quebec; 17% had sleep terrors 
and 14% had sleepwalking.10 We asked 
whether the symptoms had “ever” occurred, 
which may have led to positive 
responses from parents of some children 
who would not have met criteria 
for the diagnoses. Bruxism is reported 
to occur in a variable 7 to 88% of children22 
and was identified by parents in 
about one third of our younger patients. 
We found a lower frequency (16%) of 
bruxism among middle school-aged 
children, which is consistent with previous 
findings.10 The association we 
found between bruxism and SDB 
symptoms has been previously reported 
among adults23; SDB may exacerbate 
bruxism, or else conditions associated 
with bruxism, such as craniofacial abnormalities 
and temperomandibular 
disorders24, may exacerbate SDB. 

Insomnia and bedtime resistance are 
common but their prevalence among 
pediatric clinic patients has not been 
studied previously. We found that the 
frequency of insomnia–defined as the 
presence of 2 or more symptoms– 
exceeded the frequency reported in an 
epidemiologic study in which only one 
such symptom was required to establish 
the presence of insomnia.13 Again, we 
suspect that our findings arose from associations 
between insomnia and other 
medical conditions, such as disruptive 
behavior disorders and headache. 

An important limitation of the current 
data is that the PSQ cannot substitute 
for clinical assessment by experienced 

clinicians. In this report, references to 
sleep symptoms or problems rather 
than specific diagnoses were deliberate 
attempts to keep the distinction clear. 
The PSQ-derived definitions of problematic 
sleepiness and insomnia were 
relatively conservative, whereas single-
question items about parasomnias were 
probably more sensitive than specific. 
Patients were recruited at 2 university-
owned clinics and, therefore, may differ 
from patients seen in private practice or 
other geographic locations. Our sample 
was quite heterogeneous, and data on 
socioeconomic status were not collected. 
The age range included in this study 
was broad (2.0-13.9 years). Previous 
PSQ data showed little sensitivity to 
age within this range,14 but we cannot 
rule out age-dependent participation of 
children when parents fill out questionnaires, 
and such input can be influential.
25 Age also is likely to affect parents’ 
tendency to observe their children’s 
sleep. Finally, some PSQ question items 
are more apt to apply to children at certain 
ages than others. 

Despite these limitations, the results 
of this study have important implications. 
Sleep symptoms of importance to 
patients and their families appear to be 
particularly common among children 
seen at general pediatric clinics. Reviews 
of chart notes made by clinicians 
who saw our patients suggested that 
discussion of sleep problems was rare, 
diagnosis rarer, and treatment rarer 
still.26 Important opportunities to improve 
health, school performance, and 
quality of life may be lost if efforts are 
not made to increase professional and 
lay-public awareness of common childhood 
sleep disorders.27
