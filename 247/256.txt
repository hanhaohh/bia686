Objectives Previously published data from the Cleveland Children’s Sleep and Health Study demonstrated that preterm 
infants are especially vulnerable both to sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and its neurocognitive sequelae at age 8 to 11 years. 
In this analysis, we aimed to identify the components of the neonatal medical history associated with childhood SDB among 
children born prematurely. 
Study design This analysis focuses on the 383 children in the population-based cohort from the Cleveland Children’s Sleep 
and Health Study who were born <37 weeks gestational age and who had technically acceptable sleep studies performed at ages 
8 to 11 years (92% of all preterm children). Logistic regression was used to evaluate the associations between candidate 
perinatal and neonatal risk factors and the presence of childhood SDB by sleep study. 
Results Twenty-eight preterm children (7.3%) met the definition for SDB at age 8 to 11 years. Having a single mother and 
mild maternal preeclampsia were strongly associated with SDB in unadjusted and race-adjusted models. Unadjusted analyses 
also identified xanthine use and cardiopulmonary resuscitation or intubation in the delivery room as potential risk-factors for 
SDB. We did not find a significant link between traditional markers of severity of neonatal illness—such as gestational age, birth 
weight, intraventricular hemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or duration of ventilation—and childhood SDB at school 
age. 
Conclusions These results represent a first step in identifying prenatal and neonatal characteristics that place preterm 
infants at higher risk for childhood SDB. The strong association between mild preeclampsia and childhood SDB underscores 
the importance of research aimed at understanding in utero risk factors for neurorespiratory development.

leep-disordered breathing (SDB) affects 0.7% to 4% of children.1 SDB has been linked to hypertension,2 growth failure,3 
enuresis,4,5 and impairment of cognition, attention, and executive functions.6-12 Identification of children at high risk for 
SDB and its associated morbidities is particularly important given the growing body of evidence that treatment with 
adenotonsillectomy may improve quality of life and neurocognitive function.5,13-17 


Preterm infants are especially vulnerable both to SDB and its sequelae. In a Finnish 
cohort study, very low birth weight infants were shown to have a 2-fold risk of SDB as 
young adults.18 Previously published data from the Cleveland Children’s Sleep and Health 
Study (CCSHS) demonstrated that former preterm children have a 3-fold increase in the

METHODS 


The 
CCSHS 
is 
a 
population-based 
cohort 
derived 
by 
recruiting 
a 
stratified 
random 
sample 
of 
490 
term 
and 
417 
preterm 
children 
born 
between 
1988 
and 
1993 
at 
3 
Cleveland 
area 
hospitals 
as 
detailed 
previously.1 
Preterm 
infants 
were 
born 
. 
37 
weeks 
gestational 
age 
and 
were 
admitted 
to 
the 
neonatal 
intensive 
care 
unit 
(NICU) 
for 
at 
least 
1 
week. 
This 
analysis 
focuses 
on 
the 
383 
preterm 
children 
who 
had 
a 
medical 
chart 
review 
and 
a 
technically 
acceptable 
sleep 
study 
performed 
at 
age 
8 
to 
11 
years 
(92% 
of 
all 
preterm 
children). 
Institutional 
review 
boards 
at 
participating 
hospitals 
approved 
the 
protocol. 
The 
children’s 
legal 
guardians 
provided 
informed 
consent 
and 
the 
children 
assented 
to 
participation. 


Measurements 
and 
Definitions 


Neonatal 
and 
maternal 
data 
were 
obtained 
by 
chart 
review 
of 
the 
birth 
and 
hospital 
records 
performed 
by 
a 
trained 
research 
assistant 
unaware 
of 
data 
collected 
at 
the 
age 
8-to-11-year 
examination. 
Infants 
were 
diagnosed 
with 
respiratory 
distress 
syndrome 
(RDS) 
if 
they 
had 
a 
respiratory 
rate 
greater 
than 
60, 
oxygen 
saturation 
less 
than 
90%, 
increased 
work 
of 
breathing 
documented 
on 
examination, 
and 
onset 
at 
less 
than 
12 
hours 
of 
age. 
Bronchopulmonary 
dysplasia 
(BPD) 
was 
identified 
if 
an 
infant 
born 
at 
less 
than 
30 
weeks 
gestational 
age 
(GA) 
still 
had 
an 
oxygen 
requirement 
at 
36 
weeks 
GA, 
and 
if 
an 
infant 
born 
at 
greater 
than 
30 
weeks 
GA 
had 
an 
oxygen 
requirement 
for 
more 
than 
28 
days. 
We 
considered 
a 
child 
to 
have 
sustained 
a 
neurologic 
insult 
if 
he 
or 
she 
had 
a 
grade 
III 
or 
IV 
intraventricular 
hemorrhage, 
periventricular 
leukomalacia, 
hydrocephalus, 
seizures, 
cerebral 
palsy, 
or 
a 
congenital 
neurologic 
syndrome. 
Apnea 
of 
prematurity 
was 
defined 
as 
apnea 
requiring 
pharmacologic 
or 
nonpharmacologic 
intervention. 
Xanthine 
exposure 
included 
caffeine 
or 
theophylline 
treatment 
at 
any 
point 
in 
the 
neonatal 
hospitalization. 
Other 
neonatal 
data 
extracted 
from 
the 
medical 
records 
include 
the 
following: 
Apgar 
score 
at 
5 
minutes, 
chest 
compressions 
or 
intubation 
at 
delivery, 
small 
for 
gestational 
age 
(SGA, 
weight 
. 
10th 
percentile),19,20 
type 
and 
duration 
of 
respiratory 
support 
during 
the 
initial 
hospitalization 
(oxygen, 
continuous 
positive 
airway 
pressure, 
mechanical 
ventilation), 
use 
of 
postnatal 
corticosteroids, 
patent 
ductus 
arteriosus 
treated 
with 
indomethacin 
or 
surgery, 
and 
any 
cardiac, 
neurologic, 
or 
craniofacial 
congenital 
anomalies. 
Maternal 
characteristics 
extracted 
from 
the 
birth 
records 
include 
obstetrician 
diagnosis 
of 
preeclampsia 
(blood 
pressure 
[BP] 
. 
140/90 
mm 
Hg), 
which 
was 
further 
classified 
as 
mild 
(BP 
. 
160/110 
mm 
Hg) 
or 
severe 
(BP 
. 
160/100 
mm 
Hg). 
Maternal 
reports 
of 
alcohol, 
tobacco, 
or 
other 
drug 
use 
during 
pregnancy 
were 
also 
recorded. 


CHILDHOOD 
DATA. 
At 
the 
8-to-11-year-old 
examination, 
weight 
and 
height 
were 
measured 
and 
expressed 
as 
body 
mass 
index 
(BMI; 
weight/height2). 
Tonsillar 
size 
was 
assessed 
during 
a 
physical 
examination 
and 
enlarged 
tonsils 
were 
defined 
as 
50% 
obstruction 
of 
the 
airway 
based 
on 
physical 
examination 
and 
use 
of 
a 
standardized 
4-point 
scale.21 
Symptoms 


and 
demographic 
data 
were 
obtained 
from 
a 
standardized 
questionnaire. 
History 
of 
asthma 
or 
wheezing 
was 
defined 
by 
parent 
report 
of 
asthma 
and 
asthma 
symptoms. 
Parents 
also 
reported 
whether 
the 
child’s 
biological 
mother 
or 
father 
had 
a 
history 
of 
snoring 
or 
OSA, 
and 
whether 
they 
were 
single 
parents 
or 
part 
of 
a 
dual-parent 
household. 


SLEEP 
DATA. 
Limited 
channel 
cardiorespiratory 
recordings 
were 
collected 
in 
the 
home 
and 
included 
thoracic 
and 
abdominal 
excursions 
and 
estimated 
tidal 
volume 
by 
inductance 
plethysmography, 
pulse 
oximetry 
with 
waveform 
display, 
heart 
rate, 
and 
body 
position 
(PT-2 
system, 
SensorMedics, 
Yorba 
Linda, 
California). 
Sleep 
was 
identified 
when 
physiological 
variables 
were 
consistent 
with 
both 
sleep 
(eg, 
demonstrating 
little 
movement, 
reduced 
heart 
rate) 
and 
sleep-wake 
times 
recorded 
by 
the 
parent 
in 
a 
sleep 
diary. 
Estimated 
sleep 
time 
was 
calculated 
as 
the 
total 
number 
of 
minutes 
identified 
as 
sleep. 
Obstructive 
apneas 
were 
scored 
when 
chest 
and 
abdominal 
efforts 
were 
asynchronous, 
and 
estimated 
tidal 
volume 
was 
less 
than 
25% 
baseline, 
irrespective 
of 
associated 
desaturation. 
Hypopneas 
were 
scored 
when 
respiratory 
efforts 
were 
accompanied 
by 
a 
25% 
to 
50% 
reduction 
in 
estimated 
tidal 
volume 
and 
accompanied 
by 
an 
at 
least 
3% 
oxyhemoglobin 
desaturation. 
All 
obstructive 
apneas 
and 
hypopneas, 
each 
at 
least 
8 
seconds 
long, 
were 
tabulated 
and 
divided 
by 
the 
estimated 
sleep 
time 
to 
provide 
the 
AHI. 
Central 
apneas 
are 
not 
included 
in 
the 
AHI. 


Our 
primary 
outcome 
variable 
was 
SDB 
defined 
as 
at 
least 
one 
obstructive 
apnea 
per 
hour 
(OAI 
. 
1) 
or 
an 
apnea 
hypopnea 
index 
(AHI) 
. 
5. 
However, 
exploratory 
analyses 
were 
also 
conducted 
defining 
SDB 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
an 
AHI 
. 
1, 
because 
this 
definition 
is 
also 
used 
in 
clinical 
practice. 
Methods 
for 
overnight 
home 
sleep 
study, 
physical 
measurements, 
and 
ascertainment 
of 
demographic 
and 
medical 
data 
have 
been 
previously 
described 
in 
detail.1 


All 
records 
were 
scored 
without 
clinical 
correlates 
by 
scorers 
who 
regularly 
participated 
in 
scoring 
exercises 
to 
maintain 
interobserver 
consistency. 
To 
document 
reliability 
of 
the 
AHI, 
we 
compared 
the 
AHI 
from 
the 
home 
study 
with 
the 
AHI 
derived 
from 
full 
attended 
polysomnography 
performed 
within 
3 
months 
of 
the 
home 
study 
in 
55 
children 
with 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
SDB. 
The 
mean 
AHI 
was 
2.6 
. 
8.0 
and 


2.9 
. 
7.5, 
for 
laboratory 
versus 
home 
studies, 
respectively 
(intraclass 
correlation 
coefficient 
. 
0.85). 
With 
a 
threshold 
value 
for 
SDB 
of 
at 
least 
5 
events 
per 
hour, 
the 
sensitivity 
for 
SDB 
classification 
by 
home 
studies 
was 
88%, 
and 
specificity 
was 
98% 
compared 
with 
laboratory 
studies. 
Statistical 
Analysis 


Perinatal 
factors 
and 
childhood 
characteristics 
of 
pre-
term 
infants, 
stratified 
by 
SDB, 
were 
summarized 
using 
medians 
and 
the 
interquartile 
range 
for 
continuous 
measures, 
and 
counts 
and 
proportions 
for 
categorical 
variables. 
Logistic 
regression 
was 
used 
to 
assess 
the 
relationship 
between 
each 
of 
the 
infant 
and 
school-age 
characteristics 
and 
each 
of 
the 
2

of 
SDB.

RESULTS 


Sample 
characteristics 
for 
the 
383 
formerly 
preterm 
children 
are 
described 
in 
Table 
I. 
Twenty-eight 
children 
(7.3%) 
met 
the 
primary 
definition 
for 
SDB, 
and 
52 
children 
(13.6%) 
met 
the 
criteria 
for 
SDB 
using 
the 
secondary 
more 
liberal 
definition. 


Associations 
of 
SDB 
with 
Demographic 
Factors 


The 
odds 
of 
SDB 
were 
3-to 
4-fold 
higher 
in 
children 
whose 
mothers 
were 
single 
or 
who 
were 
of 
a 
minority 
race 
(Table 
II). 
The 
prevalence 
of 
SDB 
in 
black 
children 
(12.4%) 
was 
comparable 
to 
the 
prevalence 
among 
other 
non-white 
children 
(12.5%) 
and 
was 
significantly 
higher 
than 
for 
white 
children 
(3.9%) 
(P 
. 
.0022). 
Gestational 
age, 
birth 
weight 
and 
sex 
were 
not 
significantly 
associated 
with 
SDB. 


Associations 
of 
SDB 
with 
In 
Utero 
Exposures 


Sixty-one 
(15.9%) 
infants 
were 
born 
to 
a 
mother 
with 
a 
diagnosis 
of 
preeclampsia; 
70% 
(n 
. 
43) 
were 
classified 
as 
severe, 
15% 
(n 
. 
9) 
as 
mild, 
and 
15% 
(n 
. 
9) 
as 
unknown 
severity. 
A 
history 
of 
mild 
preeclampsia 
was 
strongly 
associated 
with 
SDB. 
Compared 
with 
those 
without 
maternal 
pre-
eclampsia, 
children 
whose 
mothers 
had 
mild 
preeclampsia 
had 
more 
than 
a 
7-fold 
increased 
odds 
of 
SDB; 
in 
contrast, 
children 
whose 
mothers 
had 
severe 
preeclampsia 
were 
not 
at 
significantly 
increased 
odds 
of 
SDB. 
These 
associations 
did 
not 
appreciably 
change 
after 
adjusting 
for 
race. 
Although 
the 
point-estimates 
of 
the 
odds 
ratios 
for 
maternal 
smoking 
and 
SGA 
were 
2.1 
and 
2.2, 
respectively, 
neither 
was 
significantly 
associated 
with 
SDB. 


Associations 
of 
SDB 
with 
Peripartum 
Resuscitation 


CPR 
or 
intubation 
in 
the 
early 
neonatal 
period 
was 
associated 
with 
a 
2-to 
3-fold 
increased 
odds 
of 
SDB; 
this 
association 
was 
attenuated 
after 
adjustment 
for 
race. 
A 
low 
Apgar 
5-minute 
score 
was 
not 
significantly 
associated 
with 
SDB. 


Associations 
of 
SDB 
with 
Perinatal 
Respiratory 
Conditions 
and 
Exposures 


Xanthine 
use 
was 
associated 
with 
more 
than 
2-fold 
increased 
odds 
of 
SDB, 
which 
was 
slightly 
attenuated 
after 
race 
adjustment. 
None 
of 
the 
respiratory 
variables, 
including 
BPD, 
RDS, 
highest 
level 
of 
respiratory 
support, 
and 
duration 
of 
supplemental 
oxygen 
use, 
were 
significantly 
associated 
with 
SDB. 


Other 
Associations 


Neurologic 
variables, 
congenital

and 
family

were 
not 
associated 
with 
SDB.

of 
removed 
tonsils 
(Table 
III). 
Children 
with 
a 
BMI 
90th 
percentile 
had 
2.8 
times 
the 
odds 
of 
SDB 
compared 
with 
children 
with 
BMI 
. 
90th 
percentile. 
The 
odds 
of 
SDB 
were 
2.9 
times 
higher 
among 
children 
who 
had 
their 
tonsils 
removed 
compared 
with 
children 
who 
did 
not. 
Asthma/wheezing 
and 
enlarged 
tonsils 
were 
not 
significantly 
associated 
with 
SDB. 


Interrelationships 
of 
Exposures 
with 
Preeclampsia 


Because 
mild 
preeclampsia 
was 
the 
strongest 
risk 
factor 
of 
SDB 
in 
this 
sample, 
we 
also 
explored 
associations 
between 
preeclampsia 
and 
other 
putative 
neonatal 
risk 
factors, 
recognizing 
that 
these 
analyses 
were 
underpowered 
to 
detect 
small 
to 
moderate 
effects. 
No 
significant 
differences 
in 
gestational 
age, 
birth 
weight, 
sex, 
race, 
maternal 
age, 
maternal 
snoring, 
BPD, 
RDS, 
or 
duration 
of 
ventilation 
were 
observed 
among 
the 
severe, 
mild, 
and 
no 
preeclampsia 
groups. 
However, 
there 
was 
less 
maternal 
smoking 
in 
the 
severe 
group 
(11.6%) 
than 
in 
the 
mild 
(22.2%) 
or 
no 
preeclampsia 
(33.2%) 
groups 
(P 
. 
.0132). 
There 
was 
less 
drug 
and 
alcohol 
use 
reported 
in 
the 
preeclampsia 
groups 
than 
those 
without 
preeclampsia 
(P 
. 
.05). 
In 
addition, 
the 
mild 
and 
severe 
preeclampsia 
groups 
had 
a 
higher 
proportion 
of 
children 
born 
SGA 
(33.3% 
and 
30.2%, 
respectively) 
compared 
with 
the 
group 
without 
preeclampsia 
(15.8%) 
(P 
. 
.0328). 


Alternative 
Definition 
of 
SDB 


Finally, 
we 
performed 
an 
exploratory 
analysis 
with 
an 
alternative, 
more 
liberal 
definition 
of 
SDB 
(AHI 
. 
1, 
n 
. 
52). 
Associations 
were 
generally 
weaker 
than 
the 
results 
obtained 
when 
defining 
SDB 
as 
an 
obstructive 
apnea

or

DISCUSSION 


Previous 
studies 
have 
shown 
that 
preterm 
infants 
are 
both 
more 
likely 
to 
have 
development 
of 
SDB 
at 
school 
age 


and 
more 
likely 
to 
have 
associated 
neurocognitive 
sequelae 
if 
they 
have 
SDB.1,8 
Our 
results 
indicate 
that 
among 
premature 
infants, 
minorities, 
those 
with 
single 
mothers, 
and 
those 
exposed 
to 
mild 
preeclampsia 
in 
utero 
are 
at 
highest 
risk 
for 
SDB.

at

An 
association 
between 
childhood 
SDB 
and 
maternal 
preeclampsia 
has 
not 
been 
reported 
previously. 
The 
observed 
relationship 
was 
based 
on 
a 
small 
number 
of 
individuals 
with 
mild 
preeclampsia 
and 
thus 
needs 
to 
be 
interpreted 
cautiously 
because 
the 
association 
could 
be 
spurious. 
In 
general, 
pre-
eclampsia 
has 
been 
associated 
with 
a 
variety 
of 
inflammatory 
mediators, 
and 
the 
effects 
of 
these 
on 
neurorespiratory 
development 
are 
largely 
unknown.22,23 
Alternatively, 
the 
association 
between 
preeclampsia 
and 
SDB 
could 
be 
mediated 
by 
fetal 
hypoxia.24-31 
Preeclampsia 
may 
cause 
chronic 
fetal 
hypoxia 
directly 
via 
maternal 
vascular 
insufficiency 
with 
subsequent 
reduction 
of 
fetal 
oxygen 
delivery 
because 
of 
placental 
insufficiency 
or 
may 
be 
acting 
as 
a 
marker 
for 
intermittent 
maternal 
hypoxia 
associated 
with 
maternal 
SDB. 
The 
association 
of 
childhood 
SDB 
with 
mild 
but 
not 
severe 
preeclampsia 
is 
of 
particular 
interest 
because 
it 
is 
consistent 
with 
proposed 
differences 
in 
the 
biology 
of 
mild 
versus 
severe 
preeclampsia. 
Differences 
in 
risk 
factors 
between 
women 
with 
mild 
and 
severe 
preeclampsia 
include 
higher 
maternal 
weight 
and 
a 
higher 
predilection 
for 
metabolic 
syndrome 
in 
those 
with 
the 
milder 
preeclampsia 
phenotype.32 
As 
it 
relates 
to 
SDB, 
mild 
preeclampsia 
may 
be 
a 
marker 
for 
women 
at 
risk 
for 
snoring 
or 
SDB 
when 
confronted 
with 
pregnancy-related 
weight 
gain 
or 
fluid 
changes33-37; 
or 
the 
association 
we 
observed 
may 
relate 
to 
an 
underlying 
genetic 
predisposition 
of 
both 
mothers 
and 
their 
children 
to 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
or 
to 
obesity-related 
diseases.38 


Differences 
in 
the 
association 
of 
SDB 
with 
mild 
as 
compared 
to 
severe 
preeclampsia 
may 
also 
be 
due 
to 
differences 
in 
smoking 
exposure 
in 
each 
group 
and 
potential 
confounding 
by 
this 
exposure. 
Maternal 
smoking 
is 
reported 
to 
reduce 
risk 
of 
preeclampsia32; 
consistent 
with 
this, 
in 
our 
sample, 
the 
severe 
preeclampsia 
group 
had 
one 
half 
the 
prevalence 
of 
smoking 
than 
the 
mild 
group, 
and 
one 
third 
the 
prevalence 
than 
those 
without 
preeclampsia, 
In 
our 
sample, 
maternal 
smoking 
also 
was 
associated 
with 
an 
approximately 
2-fold 
increased 
risk 
of 
childhood 
SDB, 
which, 
although 
not 
meeting 
statistical 
significance 
(P 
. 
.0627), 
is 
consistent 
with 
a 
recent 
report 
relating 
maternal 
smoking 
and 
SDB 
in 
adults 
who 
had 
been 
very 
low 
birth 
weight.18 
Although 
it 
is 
also 
plausible 
to 
speculate 
that 
a 
combination 
of 
the 
placental 


effects 
of 
preeclampsia 
and 
smoking 
placed 
the 
mild 
pre-
eclampsia 
group 
at 
higher 
risk 
of 
SDB, 
the 
small 
sample 
size 
did 
not 
allow 
us 
to 
test 
for 
such 
an 
interaction. 


Exposure 
to 
perinatal 
hypoxia 
with 
or 
without 
hyperoxia 
could 
also 
be 
the 
mechanism 
causing 
the 
apparent 
association 
between 
CPR 
or 
intubation 
in 
the 
delivery 
room 
and 
SDB. 
Pharyngeal 
trauma 
from 
emergency 
intubation 
leading 
to 
either 
laryngotracheomalacia 
or 
subglottic 
stenosis, 
compromising 
airway 
patency, 
is 
another 
potential 
causal 
link. 
Alternatively, 
underlying 
differences 
in 
respiratory 
control 
could 
cause 
both 
an 
increased 
likelihood 
of 
requiring 
resuscitation 
postpartum 
and 
a 
predilection 
to 
childhood 
SDB. 


Xanthine 
exposure, 
but 
not 
a 
diagnosis 
of 
apnea 
of 
prematurity, 
was 
associated 
with 
childhood 
SDB 
in 
unadjusted 
analyses. 
Although 
certainly 
not 
proof 
of 
a 
causal 
association 
between 
neonatal 
xanthine 
exposure 
and 
childhood 
SDB, 
this 
finding 
is 
intriguing 
in 
light 
of 
new 
animal 
data 
suggesting 
that 
neonatal 
caffeine 
exposure 
can 
alter 
adult 
sleep 
architecture.39 
A 
potential 
causative 
association 
between 
xanthine 
use 
and 
school-aged 
SDB 
warrants 
further 
investigation, 
as 
caffeine 
is 
currently 
one 
of 
the 
most 
commonly 
used 
drugs 
in 
the 
NICU.40 
Alternatively, 
if 
xanthines 
were 
selectively 
prescribed 
for 
the 
most 
severe 
apnea 
of 
prematurity, 
an 
association 
between 
xanthines 
and 
SDB 
could 
be 
due 
to 
persistent 
underlying 
abnormalities 
in 
respiratory 
control 
in 
certain 
patients. 
Xanthine 
prescription 
could 
also 
be 
a 
marker 
for 
more 
severe 
neonatal 
intermittent 
hypoxia, 
which 
may 
alter 
the 
development 
of 
respiratory 
responses.24-30,39 


Having 
a 
single 
mother 
was 
associated 
with 
both 
SDB 
in 
unadjusted 
and 
race-adjusted 
analyses. 
We 
speculate 
that 
this 
variable 
is 
serving 
as 
a 
marker 
for 
socioeconomic 
factors. 
We 
have 
previously 
shown 
that 
neighborhood 
disadvantage 
was 
associated 
with 
SDB 
in 
the 
entire 
CCSHS 
cohort.41 
Possible 
mechanisms 
include 
higher 
exposures 
to 
allergens, 
irritants, 
or 
respiratory 
infections 
in 
this 
group, 
other 
comorbid 
conditions, 
or 
inequities 
in 
interactions 
with 
the 
health 
care 
system. 
The 
association 
between 
single 
mothers 
and 
SDB 
serves 
as 
an 
important 
reminder 
that 
long-term 
pulmonary 
outcomes 
of 
prematurity, 
just 
like 
neurodevelopmental 
outcomes,42,43 
may 
be 
modified 
by 
important 
social 
factors 
after 
discharge 
from 
the 
NICU. 


We 
did 
not 
find 
a 
significant 
association 
between 
any 
markers 
of 
brain 
injury 
in 
infancy 
and 
SDB. 
This 
is 
consistent

with 
the 
hypothesis 
that 
the 
increased 
neurocognitive 
abnormalities 
previously 
reported 
in 
preterm 
infants 
with 
SDB 
are 
a 
consequence 
of 
SDB 
itself 
and 
not 
merely 
a 
clustering 
of 
long-term 
morbidities 
in 
the 
most 
severely 
affected 
preterm 
infants.8 
Despite 
the 
lack 
of 
association 
with 
central 
nervous 
system 
injury, 
changes 
in 
peripheral 
nervous 
system 
sensitivity 
and 
responses 
could 
still 
account 
for 
the 
increased 
SDB 
seen 
in 
preterm 
infants. 


Our 
goals 
were 
to 
identify 
potential 
underlying 
risk 
factors 
that 
predispose 
preterm 
children 
to 
develop 
SDB 
in 
childhood. 
Given 
the 
paucity 
of 
prior 
work 
in 
this 
area, 
multiple 
comparisons 
were 
performed 
across 
a 
number 
of 
risk 
domains. 
Because 
this 
approach 
increases 
the 
likelihood 
of 
type 
I 
error, 
our 
findings 
will 
require 
replication 
in 
future 
research 
studies. 
Similarly, 
this 
study 
may 
have 
had 
insufficient 
statistical 
power 
to 
detect 
associations 
between 
several 
candidate 
risk 
factors 
and 
SDB 
with 
small 
to 
modest 
effects. 
The 
low 
sample 
prevalence 
of 
SDB 
also 
limited 
our 
ability 
to 
adjust 
for 
multiple 
factors; 
residual 
confounding 
may 
have 
been 
operative. 
Additionally, 
inclusion 
criteria 
in 
the 
original 
cohort 
required 
an 
admission 
to 
the 
NICU 
of 
at 
least 
one 
week 
duration, 
which 
may 
have 
excluded 
late-preterm 
infants 
with 
low 
severity 
of 
illness; 
a 
different 
pattern 
of 
results 
may 
occur 
among 
samples 
that 
include 
healthier 
late-preterm 
infants. 
Nonetheless, 
the 
observed 
associations 
represent 
a 
starting 
point 
for 
understanding 
the 
mechanisms 
leading 
to 
SDB 
in 
premature 
infants, 
and 
may 
identify 
several 
fruitful 
research 
directions. 


The 
study 
has 
a 
number 
of 
important 
strengths, 
including 
the 
relatively 
large 
sample 
of 
children 
born 
at 
3 
area 
hospitals, 
detailed 
neonatal 
medical 
histories, 
and 
rigorous 
collection 
of 
sleep 
study 
data 
collected 
when 
the 
children 
were 
8 
to 
11 
years 
old. 


In 
conclusion, 
having 
a 
single 
mother, 
minority 
race, 
and 
mild 
maternal 
preeclampsia 
were 
associated 
with 
SDB 
in 
this 
sample 
of 
preterm 
children. 
Unadjusted 
analyses 
also 
identified 
xanthine 
use 
and 
CPR 
or 
intubation 
in 
the 
delivery 
room 
as 
potential 
risk 
factors 
for 
SDB. 
We 
did 
not 
find 
a 
link 
between 
traditional 
markers 
of 
severity 
in 
pre-
term 
infants—such 
as 
gestational 
age, 
birth 
weight, 
IVH, 
BPD, 
or 
duration 
of 
ventilation—and 
SDB 
at 
school 
age. 
Although 
these 
findings 
need 
to 
be 
confirmed 
in 
other 
samples, 
and 
potential 
mechanisms 
further 
explored, 
these 
results 
represent 
a 
first 
step 
in 
identifying 
which 
premature 
infants 
are 
at 
higher 
risk 
for 
childhood 
SDB. 
In 
particular, 
the 
association 
between 
xanthine 
exposure 
and 
SDB 
serves 
as 
a 
reminder 
that 
neonatal 
interventions 
may 
have 
the 
potential 
to 
impact 
long-term 
respiratory 
control. 
Furthermore, 
the 
strong 
association 
between 
mild 
preeclampsia 
and 
childhood 
SDB 
underscores 
the 
importance 
of 
research 
aimed 
at 
understanding 
in 
utero 
risk 
factors 
for 
neurorespiratory 
development.

appreciate
