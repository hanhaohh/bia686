Study Objective: There is continuing speculation about the relationship 
between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obstructive 
sleep apnea (OSA) or periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD)/restless 
legs syndrome. The objective was to determine if a significant portion 
of children with ADHD diagnosed using DSM-IV criteria have OSA 
or PLMD. 
Setting: Sleep disorders centers in a private practice setting and a hospital 
setting. 
Participants: Children aged 6 to 14 years with ADHD were enrolled. Patients 
with snoring were not excluded. Although patients with snoring plus 
either observed apneic episodes in sleep or excessive daytime sleepiness 
were to be excluded, as were patients with restless legs at night, only 1 
subject actually had to be excluded because of these criteria. 
Measurements and Results: Forty children were evaluated with a polysomnogram. 
A respiratory disturbance index cut-off of more than 5 per 
hour of sleep was used to diagnose OSA, and a periodic limb movement 
(with arousal) index cut-off of 5 or more per hour of sleep was used to diagnose 
PLMD. The Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale


IV-Parent Version: Investigator Administered and Scored was used to 
determine severity of inattentive, hyperactive, and total ADHD symptoms. 
Except for a somewhat longer rapid eye movement sleep latency and decreased 
percentage of rapid eye movement sleep, polysomnography was 
essentially normal. No patient had OSA or PLMD on polysomnography. 
Conclusions: OSA or PLMD is not a common underlying disorder or etiologic 
factor in patients who meet the criteria for ADHD. In the absence 
of symptoms suggesting a primary sleep disorder, such as snoring with 
observed apneic episodes in sleep or daytime sleepiness or restless legs, 
polysomnographic evaluation does not seem indicated in patients with 
ADHD.

tion between severity of sleep disturbance and problems in neurobehavioral 
function for a healthy comparison group but not for 
patients with ADHD. They suggest that, despite the similarity in 
symptoms caused by sleep fragmentation and ADHD symptoms, 
the 2 are different clinical conditions. 

Even if we accept that OSA or PLMD can truly cause symptoms 
similar to those of ADHD, do a large percentage of children 
diagnosed with ADHD really have OSA or PLMD? Are OSA and 
PLMD really significant etiologies of ADHD? If yes, then it is a 
reasonable hypothesis that a significant portion of children with 
ADHD should have OSA or PLMD on clinical history, PSG, or 
both. The alternative hypothesis is that a significant portion of 
children with ADHD do not have evidence of OSA or PLMD. If 
this is the finding, then it is reasonable to suggest that inattention 
or hyperactivity seen in ADHD patients is a different clinical condition 
from inattention or hyperactivity seen in patients with OSA 
or PLMD. 

This is a report of a PSG study on 40 children with clear ADHD 
without clinical evidence of restless legs at night, observed apneic 
episodes, or snoring with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). 
Patients with snoring without observed apneic episodes in sleep 
or daytime sleepiness were not excluded, and only 1 patient was 
excluded because of snoring with EDS (and none for restless legs 
at night). 

METHODS 


This report is based on the first part of a double-blind crossover 
study of treatment effects of atomoxetine and methylphenidate in 
ADHD. Inclusion criteria included age 6 to 14 years; a diagnosis 
of ADHD (inattentive, hyperactive, or combined) based on Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition 
(DSM-IV) criteria,18 as well as Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders 
and Schizophrenia for School Aged Children-Present and 
Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL); Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity 
Disorder Rating Scale-IV-Parent Version: Investigator Administered 
and Scored (ADHD-RS)19,20 scores greater than 1 SD from 
normal; full-scale Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, of 80 
or higher; normal lab results, including serum chemistries, hematology, 
and urinalysis; normal electrocardiogram; agreement by 
subject not to use caffeinated beverages during the study; ability 
to maintain a consistent “lights-out” time during the study of no 
more than 30 minutes before or after the habitual bedtime (could 
be 30 minutes later on nonschool nights than on school nights); 
weight between 25 and 60 kg; and a score of 4 (moderate) or 
higher on the Clinical Global Impression-Severity on a 7-point 
scale. Exclusion criteria included treatment with any investigational 
drug within 30 days of study entry; participation in a previous 
atomoxetine investigational study; presence of primary sleep 
disorders or other disorders commonly associated with secondary 
alterations in normal sleep patterns not attributable to ADHD; 
history of bipolar disorder or psychosis or taking antipsychotic 
medicines within 4 weeks of study entry; a DSM-IV diagnosis of 
major depression or Children’s Depression Rating Scale-Revised 
score of 36 or more; at serious suicidal or homicidal risk; current 
or past alcohol or drug abuse; pregnant or breast-feeding; any 
history of seizure disorder (excluding febrile seizures) or of anticonvulsant 
treatment; taking any prescription or over-the-counter 
central nervous system-active medicines (except sympathomimetic 
medicines used not on a daily basis or diphenhydramine 

used for reason other than sedation); significant prior or current 
medical conditions that could be exacerbated by atomoxetine; 
any medical condition that has sympathomimetic activity; use of 
a monoamine oxidase inhibitor within 2 weeks of starting active 
study drug; history of glaucoma; elevated blood pressure greater 
than 90th percentile; and no previous response to an adequate trial 
of stimulants or desipramine. 

For purposes of this study, patients were considered to have 
a primary sleep disorder if they reported restless legs at bedtime 
or if the parent reported that the child snored and had observed 
apneic episodes in sleep or snored and had EDS. Patients whose 
parents reported that the child snored but did not have EDS or 
observed apneic episodes in sleep were not excluded. 

The study was approved by an Investigational Review Board. 
The study was conducted at 2 centers (RBS and JO). At the screening 
visit, a parent or guardian of all patients signed an informed 
consent. The patient signed an assent form. A detailed history and 
physical and psychiatric examination were then conducted. Laboratory 
assessments and an electrocardiogram were performed. KSADS-
PL and Children’s Depression Rating Scale-Revised were 
administered. The ADHD-RS, created by rating each of the 18 
DSM-IV ADHD symptoms on a scale of 0 to 3, was administered 
by the investigator at the screening visit based on information 
from the parent, and a Clinical Global Impression-Severity was 
determined. The subject’s usual lights-out time was established. 
At visit 2, which occurred 5 to 12 days after the screening visit, 
compliance with consistent lights-out time was reviewed. The 
Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children was administered either 
at the screening visit (JO) or at visit 2 (RBS). This difference was 
related to scheduling issues. 

One investigator (RBS) excluded 1 subject from the protocol 
at the screening visit because of history of snoring with EDS. No 
other subjects were excluded because of a primary sleep disorder. 
The investigator at center 2 (JO) did not exclude any subjects. 

Visit 3 was the baseline visit occurring 5 to 12 days after 
visit 2. The ADHD symptoms and their severity were reviewed 
to make sure patients still met inclusion criteria. Upon completion 
of visit 3, patients entered the double-blind treatment phase. 
Subjects were offered participation in additional PSG studies to 
be conducted at visit 3 (as well as at further time points along 
the way during the double-blind treatment trials). The PSG was 
performed on the night after the assessment of ADHD severity 
at visit 3 and prior to randomization to double-blind treatment. 
About half the subjects (40 out of 85 subjects completing visit 3) 
volunteered to participate in these additional PSG studies. This 
is a report on the first night PSG for the 40 subjects (30 from 1 
center [RBS] and 10 from the other [JO]) who volunteered to 
participate in the PSG studies. 

Subjects who volunteered for the PSG studies did not differ 
from those that did not in terms of sex, age, height, weight, body 
mass index, Clinical Global Impression, ADHD-RS, ADHD subtype, 
inattention subscore of the ADHD-RS, or hyperactivity sub-
score of the ADHD-RS. The PSG on the first night consisted of 
2 channels of central electroencephalogram, electrooculogram, 
submental electromyogram, electrocardiogram, nasal pressure, 
respiratory effort, oximetry, and leg movement recordings. Subjects 
went to bed at their usual bedtime. At center 1 (RBS), they 
stayed in bed until spontaneous awakening or 8:00 AM, whichever 
was earlier. At center 2 (JO), they stayed in bed until 5:30 AM 
because of scheduling issues. All patients had a usual bedtime

Data Analysis 

Data from the screening-visit ADHD assessments and the first 
night of PSG (which included cardiorespiratory and leg movement 
monitoring) were analyzed. Descriptive statistical analysis 
of PSG and clinical data was performed using SPSS (SPSS, Inc., 
Chicago, Ill). Correlation coefficients between PSG data and clinical 
data were calculated. 

RESULTS 

The 40 patients (mean age 10.5, SD 2.0, range 6.3-15.0, 32 
boys, 8 girls) had moderate to severe ADHD. Table 1 gives the 
information on their PSG variables and the ADHD-RS and its 
inattention and hyperactivity components. 

PSG recordings were essentially normal except, possibly, the 
latency to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (179.1 minutes, SD 
61.8, range 65-342) and percentage of stage REM sleep (17.8%, 
SD 5.9%, range 5.9%-29.8%). The mean RDI was 1.9 per hour 
of sleep (SD 1.5, range 0-4.9). After excluding central events, the 
mean obstructive RDI was 1.8 per hour of sleep (SD 1.5, range 04.9). 
The mean PLMAI was 0.5 per hour of sleep (SD 1.1, range 
0-5.0). 

Seventeen subjects (42.5%) had an obstructive RDI between 
0 and 1 per hour of sleep, 7 (17.5%) between 1 and 2 per hour of 
sleep, 7 (17.5%) between 2 and less than 3 per hour of sleep, 4 
(10%) between 3 and 4 per hour of sleep, and 5 (12.5%) between 
4 and 5 per hour of sleep. No patient had an RDI greater than 5 
per hour of sleep or a PLMAI greater than 5 per hour of sleep. 
RDI and PLMAI were not correlated with any ADHD ratings. 
The alternative hypothesis (that a significant portion of children 
with ADHD do not have evidence of OSA or PLMD) was found 
to be correct. 

Total time in bed was truncated by awakening the patients at 

5:30 am at center 2 (JO), which would be expected to also decrease 
total sleep time. Intercenter comparisons revealed higher 
total time in bed (553 vs 463 minutes, P < .001) and total sleep 
time (498 vs 447 minutes, P = .003) at center 1 (RBS), along with 
higher ADHD-RS (40.5 vs 33.6, P = .016). Therefore, total sleep 
time and total time in bed were not used in the correlational analysis. 
Specifically, there were no intercenter differences in latency 
to REM sleep or in percentage of time spent in REM sleep. The 
correlation coefficients are shown in Table 2. The only significant

children referred for sleep-disordered breathing and found that 
children with or without sleep-disordered breathing on PSG had 
similar levels of hyperactivity. The hyperactivity actually showed 
no association with rate of apneas and hypopneas or minimum 
oxygen saturation. In the fifth paper, Chervin et al6 reported that 
children with borderline high Conner’s Parent Rating Scale hyperactivity 
index (> 60, which is 1 SD above age and sex norms) 
were more likely to have habitual snoring and sleepiness. One 
SD from mean on the Conner’s Parent Rating Scale hyperactivity 
index does not suggest ADHD. It merely suggests mild hyperactivity. 


An examination of the next 4 papers quoted by Lewin and 
DiPinto,1 purportedly showing that a large percentage of children 
diagnosed with ADHD have underlying PLMD and RLS, shows 
mixed results. Wackermann et al7 actually report on brain electric 
maturation in normal subjects and not on PLMD or RLS in 
ADHD. Walters et al8 reported on 7 patients with diagnosed RLS/ 
PLMD and ADHD. They specifically included only patients with 
ADHD and RLS and were not attempting to show that a large percentage 
of patients with ADHD have PLMD or RLS. Dopaminergic 
agents improved the Total Conners Parent Rating Scale score 
for these patients from a mean baseline of 15.1 to a posttreatment 
score of 6.26. Although a Total Conners Parent Rating Scale of 

15.1 may be higher than normal, it is not typically considered 
suggestive of ADHD. Patients with ADHD typically have significantly 
higher scores. Therefore, Walters et al’s patients, if they 
had ADHD, had very mild cases. Picchietti et al9 did show that 
27% of children with ADHD (compared with 5% of controls) had 
a periodic limb movements index (PLMI) greater than 5 per hour 
of sleep. Crabtree et al10 found that 8.4% of a clinic sample and 
11.9% of a community sample of 5- to 7-year-old children had a 
PLMI greater than 5 per hour of sleep. Of these children, 44.4% 
were identified as having ADHD, based on parents’ reporting on 
a questionnaire that the child had ADHD, without a medical or 
underlying OSA syndrome or PLMD/RLS. However, examina-psychiatric diagnostic interview. Further, when they separated

centage of children diagnosed with ADHD have underlying OSA or 1.9/h sleep), suggesting little sleep disturbance and little evisyndrome) 
is hard to justify for OSA. dence that the periodic limb movements were causing the ADHD. 

In the first paper, Goodwin et al2 did a questionnaire study Despite this, the authors postulated that the relationship between

that, in a community sample, a meaningful RDI in terms of higher 
prevalence of clinical symptoms is 1 per hour of sleep with 3% 
desaturations, but it is 5 per hour of sleep if desaturations are not 
required. This would correspond closely with our cut-off point of 
5 per hour of sleep when requiring either desaturations or arousals 
(our criterion would be somewhat more liberal than Goodwin’s, 
as it would include events with desaturations without arousals). 
Additional support for this cut-off is found in Tang et al’s23 report 
that, using an index derived from all obstructive apneas and 
hypopneas regardless of desaturation, more than half (52.7%) of 
children have an RDI greater than 1 per hour of sleep, while 3.9% 
have an RDI greater than 5 per hour of sleep (52.5% of our sample 
had an RDI > 1/h of sleep and 0% had an RDI >5/h of sleep using 
similar definitions). 

Periodic limb movements may not always be clinically significant, 
and there has been a need to define a disorder associated 
with them, PLMD.24 Although most authors have set a PLMI of 5 
as significant, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine practice 
parameters on the use of PSG in insomnia25 propose that a finding 
of greater than 10 to 15 PLMAI would seem to warrant consideration 
of treatment. Therefore, we defined significant periodic 
limb movements as those associated with arousals for the purpose 
of this report. The general lack of significant correlation between 
ADHD severity ratings and PSG variables strengthens the findings 
of Gruber et al that there is no association between measures 
of sleep and performance on complicated neurobehavioral tasks 
in patients with ADHD. If anything, patients with more severe 
ADHD had a lower percentage of stage 1 sleep, which is the opposite 
of what would be expected if sleep fragmentation is causing 
the ADHD symptoms. 

Wagner et al26 recently reported increased symptoms of ADHD 
in adults with RLS. Our focus was on objective PSG findings, not 
on subjective restless legs ratings, and we can neither confirm nor 
deny any relationship between RLS and ADHD. 

The only PSG findings among ADHD patients that were unusual, 
in comparison with findings reported by Kirov et al in control 
subjects aged 8 to 14 years,27 were longer REM latency (mean 
REM latency 131.7 minutes, SD 40.6, for their controls; mean 

179.1 minutes, SD 61.8, for our ADHD subjects) and lower percentages 
of REM sleep (mean REM percentage 22.1%, SD 6.1%, 
for their controls; 17.8%, SD 5.9%, for our ADHD subjects.). 
O’Brien et al4 also reported longer REM latencies and lower percentages 
of REM sleep in patients with ADHD compared with 
children with mild ADHD symptoms and normal controls, as 
did Lecendreux et al28 in patients with ADHD as well as in patients 
with a reading disorder. On the other hand, Kirov et al27 
reported increased absoluted duration of REM in children with 
ADHD (along with increased time in bed), as compared with 17 
age-matched controls, with no difference between the 2 groups 
in REM latency or percentage of REM sleep. The significance of 
these findings remains unknown. 
Our findings agree with those of O’Brien et al4 that children 
with significant symptoms of ADHD showed no increase in OSA, 
and no sleep variable accounted for a significant proportion of 
the neurobehavioral dysfunction. It seems to us that, although it 
is possible (based on the literature) that OSA can cause mild inattention 
or hyperactivity, children with a diagnosis of moderate 
to severe ADHD are unlikely to be suffering from inattention or 
hyperactivity as a result of OSA or PLMD. 

Taken together with the findings reported by Gruber and Sa


deh17 and O’Brien et al,4 it seems that OSA or PLMD is not a 
common underlying disorder or etiologic factor in patients who 
meet the diagnostic criteria for ADHD. This does not mean that 
OSA or PLMD cannot cause symptoms similar to those seen in 
ADHD. However, such patients seem to form a different clinical 
entity from patients who meet the criteria for ADHD. Therefore, 
we conclude that, in the absence of symptoms suggesting a primary 
sleep disorder (such as snoring with observed apneic episodes 
in sleep or daytime sleepiness or restless legs at night), PSG 
evaluation does not seem indicated in patients with ADHD. 

Limitations 


The shortcomings of this analysis are that our sample size was 
not large and we did plan to exclude patients with clinical suspicion 
of primary sleep disorders from the protocol. However, 
we excluded only 1 subject for clinical suggestion of sleep apnea 
(snoring with EDS) and none for clinical suspicion of restless legs 
at night. We specifically included patients who reported snoring 
into the protocol. 

A more liberal cut-off point for OSA would have shown a 
larger prevalence of OSA in these ADHD patients. However, as 
Golan et al21 and Tang et al23 have shown, a more liberal cut-off 
point for OSA also raises the prevalence of OSA in normal subjects 
so drastically that the significance of the diagnosis becomes 
questionable. Our choice of cut-off point is borne out by the community-
based study reported by Goodwin et al.22
