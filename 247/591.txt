Study objectives: Overnight polysomnography (ONP) is the “gold standard” for the diagnosis of 
sleep-disordered breathing, but it is expensive and time-consuming. Thus, daytime nap studies 
have been used as screening tests. If the findings of a nap study are normal or mildly abnormal, 
should ONP be performed? Do specific abnormalities in nap studies predict abnormal findings in 
ONP? To answer these questions, we conducted this study. 
Design: Retrospective chart review. 
Setting: Children’s hospital. 
Participants: One hundred forty-three children with suspected obstructive sleep apnea syndrome 
secondary to isolated adenotonsillar hypertrophy, who had normal or mildly abnormal nap 
studies, and underwent ONP. 
Measurements and results: We compared daytime nap and overnight polysomnograms in 143 
children (52 girls; mean [. 
SD] age, 5.6 . 
3.1 years). Total sleep time was1hin daytime nap, and 

5.1 . 
1.3 h in ONP. The interval between the two studies was 5.9 . 
4.8 months. The findings of 
59% of the nap studies were mildly abnormal, while 66% of overnight studies were abnormal. No 
individual nap study parameter (including short obstructive apneas, hypopneas, hypoxemia, 
hypoventilation, snoring, paradoxical breathing, gasping, retractions) had good sensitivity at 
predicting abnormal overnight polysomnograms, but most had good specificity and positive 
predictive value. 
Conclusions: We conclude that individual nap study parameters are not very sensitive in 
predicting abnormal ONP findings. However, when nap study parameters are abnormal, the 
chance of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is high. (CHEST 2000; 118:360–365)

diagnosis, but most sleep laboratories can perform 
only a few overnight polysomnograms (PSGs) in a 
24-h period. With the limited number of pediatric 
sleep laboratories and trained staff, and an increasing 
demand for PSGs, it may be difficult to obtain a PSG 
in a timely manner. To overcome this problem, 
daytime short (nap) PSGs have been used as a 
screening test. The daytime nap PSGs are of shorter 
duration, may require sedation, may not include 
rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and may be 
affected by circadian variation in sleep patterns. In 
some cases, the diagnosis of OSAS can be established 
by a nap study, but in some children, findings of a 
daytime nap study may be normal or inconclusive. In 
this situation, it is difficult to decide whether an

overnight PSG is required or not. Carroll et al1 have 
previously shown that nap PSGs performed with 
chloral hydrate sedation underestimate the severity 
of sleep-disordered breathing. They also suggested 
that if a nap PSG is inconclusive, an overnight PSG 
should be performed. However, they had a small 
study population, with a variety of diagnoses, they 
had only a few children with normal nap studies, and 
the study was not specifically directed toward obstructive 
sleep apnea. Thus, it remains unknown 
which children with adenotonsillar hypertrophy with 
a normal or mildly abnormal nap study should have 
an overnight PSG. 

Therefore, we evaluated overnight PSGs in 143 
children with possible OSAS due to adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy, who had normal or only mildly abnormal 
nap studies in order to determine if any parameters 
in the nap study predict abnormal findings on 
overnight PSGs. 

Materials and Methods 

Patients 

All patients were referred for polysomnography by their physicians 
for the evaluation of OSAS secondary to adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy. The study was confined to children with adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy because they comprise the majority of children 
undergoing polysomnography in pediatric sleep laboratories, and 
they were otherwise healthy, and did not have complicating 
medical conditions. All the subjects had a nap study with either 
normal or mildly abnormal findings, and were referred back for 
an overnight study because of persistent symptoms. Inclusion 
criteria included the following: (1) age, between 1 year and 18 
years; (2) absence of any other significant disease, eg, bronchopulmonary 
dysplasia, chronic lung disease, neuromuscular diseases, 
craniofacial abnormalities; (3) no therapeutic intervention 
(eg, adenotonsillectomy) between the two studies; and (4) interval 
between nap and overnight study of . 
1 year. 

Polysomnography 

Nap PSGs were performed during a daytime nap and contained1hof 
sleep time. Chloral hydrate was routinely administered 
to induce sleep for daytime nap studies unless there were 
some contraindications to its use. These contraindications include 
history of food intake within 4 h, evidence of airways obstruction 
while awake, severe obesity, central respiratory control disorders, 
neuromuscular diseases, and hypersensitivity to chloral hydrate. 
The majority of the children received chloral hydrate. An initial 
dose of 50 mg/kg body weight (maximum dose, 1,000 mg) was 
administered po. A second dose of 25 mg/kg (maximum, 500 mg) 
was given if the child failed to sleep after a 30-min observation 
period. All these patients were examined by a physician on the 
day of study and cleared for sedation according to the Childrens 
Hospital Los Angeles sedation guidelines, including nothing po. 
Overnight PSGs were performed for 8 h, and no sedation was 
used. 

All testing was performed in the Sleep Physiology Laboratory 
by a pulmonary technician skilled in pediatric polysomnography. 
PSGs were performed in a quiet, dark room at an ambient 

temperature of 24°C. The following parameters were measured 
and recorded continuously by the Healthdyne computerized 
polysomnography system (Alice III; Respironics; Marietta, GA): 

(1) chest and abdominal wall motion by uncalibrated respiratory 
inductance plethysmography; (2) heart rate, by ECG; (3) inspired 
and end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure (Petco2), sampled at the 
nose or mouth at a rate of 60 mL/min by mass spectrometry 
(model 1100 Medical Gas Analyzer; Perkin Elmer; Pomona, CA) 
or by capnography (model 1000 Capnograph; Nellcor; Hayward, 
CA); (4) combined oral nasal air flow, sampled with a three-
pronged thermistor (Healthdyne Technologies; Marietta, GA) 
placed at the upper lip; (5) arterial oxygen saturation (Sao2), by 
pulse oximetry (model N 200; Nellcor); (6) oximeter pulse wave 
form; (7) electro-oculogram; (8) EEG in overnight PSGs; (9) chin 
electromyogram; (10) actimeter (placed on the hand); and (11) 
microphone placed over neck to monitor snoring. 
Children were also monitored and recorded on videotape, 
using an infrared video camera. The patients were continuously 
observed by the technician. Sleep behaviors, respiratory events, 
and the presence of retractions or gasping were recorded by the 
technician. EEG was not performed during daytime nap studies, 
as1hof sleep time does not yield sufficient information about 
sleep stages or EEG arousals. 

The following parameters were evaluated: (1) obstructive 
apnea, defined as complete cessation of air flow at nose and 
mouth; (2) obstructive hypopnea, defined as a reduction in 
airflow on thermistor or Petco2 tracing to . 
50% of the 
baseline; (3) apnea hypopnea index (number of obstructive 
apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep), and the longest 
duration of apnea and hypopnea were quantified; (4) hypoventilation 
(Petco2 . 
45 mm Hg), the highest Petco2 and number 
of episodes of hypoventilation were scored; (5) desaturations 
(Sao2 . 
95%), Sao2 nadir, and the number of desaturations; Sao2 
measurements associated with poor pulse tracings were discarded; 
and (6) presence or absence of snoring, paradoxical 
breathing, chest wall retractions, and gasping. 

Parents of children undergoing polysomnography at our sleep 
laboratory were requested to answer a questionnaire if snoring, 
difficulty breathing, and apnea were absent, occasionally present, 
or always present. All these questionnaires were reviewed. 

Only those patients who had normal or mildly abnormal nap 
studies, were included in the review. Nap studies were classified 
as follows: (1) normal, defined as no obstructive apnea and 
hypopnea index . 
1 event/h, Sao2 nadir . 
95%, and highest 
Petco2 . 
45 mm Hg; or (2) mildly abnormal, defined as 
obstructive apnea-hypopnea index, 1 to 2 events/h; Sao2 nadir 90 
to 94%, or highest Petco2,46to49mmHg. 

ONP findings were classified as normal or abnormal based on 
criteria previously established.3 Abnormal studies were further 
classified as follows: (1) mildly abnormal, with obstructive apnea 
hypopnea index, 1 to 2 events/h; Sao2 nadir of 90 to 94%; or 
highest Petco2, 46 to 49 mm Hg; (2) moderately abnormal, with 
obstructive apnea hypopnea index, 3 to 5 events/h; Sao2 nadir of 
85 to 89%; or highest Petco2, 50 to 54 mm Hg; or (3) severely 
abnormal, with obstructive apnea hypopnea index . 
5 events/h, 
Sao2 nadir of . 
84%; or highest Petco2 . 
55 mm Hg.

Results 

One hundred forty-three children had normal or 
mildly abnormal findings on nap PSGs from 1991 to 
1998. Their mean age was 5.6 . 
3.1 years, and 52 
were girls (36%). The mean interval between nap 
and overnight PSGs was 5.9 . 
4.8 months. Total 
sleep time during nap studies was 1 h, while mean 
sleep time during the overnight studies was 5.1 . 
1.3 h. 

One hundred thirty-eight patients (96%) were 
sedated with chloral hydrate during nap studies. The 
remaining patients did not receive chloral hydrate 
because of spontaneous sleep or a history of food 
intake within 4 h prior to study. The administration 
of chloral hydrate was not associated with any side 
effects. No patient received sedation for overnight 
studies. 

Fifty-nine of the nap study findings were normal 
(41%). Among these subjects, none had obstructive 
apnea, hypoxemia, or hypoventilation. However, 4 
subjects (7%) had brief (. 
6 s) obstructive hypopnea, 
25 subjects (42%) had snoring, 12 subjects 
(20%) had paradoxical breathing, 1 subject (2%) had 
chest retractions, and 3 subjects (5%) were noticed 
to have gasping. Among 84 children who had mildly 
abnormal findings on nap studies, 29 children (34%)

had one or more obstructive sleep apnea, 49 children 
(58%) had one or more obstructive hypopnea, 32 
children (38%) had hypoxemia, 30 children (36%) 
had hypoventilation, 52 children (62%) had snoring, 
39 children (46%) were noticed to have paradoxical 
breathing, 1 child (1%) had chest retractions, and 8 
children (9%) had gasping. These abnormalities are 
summarized in Table 1. Among overnight sleep 
studies, 95 findings (66%) were normal. The children 
with mildly abnormal nap studies were at 
significantly higher risk of having an abnormal overnight 
sleep study (p . 
0.0001), when compared to 
those who had normal nap studies (Table 2). The 
major difference between normal and abnormal nap 
studies was in the severely abnormal overnight 
studies (7% in children with normal nap findings vs 
37% in children with mildly abnormal nap study; 
p . 
0.0002; Table 3). There were 19 children (13%) 
who had a mildly abnormal nap study but a normal 
overnight study. 

Significantly more children demonstrated obstructive 
apneas, hypopneas, hypoxemia, snoring, paradoxical 
breathing, and gasping during overnight 
sleep studies (Table 4). The durations of longest 
apnea and hypopnea was also longer in overnight 
studies. There was no significant difference in the 
number of children who demonstrated hypoventilation 
and retractions during nap and overnight sleep 
studies. 

No individual nap parameter had both good sensitivity 
and specificity at predicting abnormal overnight 
studies, but most had good specificity and 
positive predictive value (Table 5). The presence of 
snoring during a nap study was the most sensitive 
(86%) parameter predicting an abnormal overnight

study, but it was also the least specific (48%). The 
presence of a mildly abnormal nap study had moderate 
sensitivity (69%) and specificity (60%) in predicting 
an abnormal overnight study. Presence of any 
obstructive apnea, hypopnea, hypoxemia, or hypoventilation 
in a nap study was moderately specific 
and had good positive predictive values, but had lower 
sensitivities. The presence of gasping and retractions 
was 100% specific with excellent positive predictive 
value, but their sensitivity was also variable. 

The questionnaires were available for 133 patients. 
The parent’s response to the questionnaire is summarized 
in Table 6. Significantly more parents of 
children with OSAS noticed that their children 
always had difficulty breathing and or apnea during 
sleep. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive 
value, and negative predictive values for each symptom 
are shown in Table 7. The always presence of 
difficulty breathing and snoring had very good sensitivities 
but low specificities. History of presence of 
apnea during sleep was neither sensitive nor very 
specific in predicting OSAS. 

Discussion 

We found that no individual nap study parameter 
was very sensitive in predicting the presence of 
obstructive sleep apnea in an overnight sleep study. 
However, many of them had good specificity and 
positive predictive values. We also found that if nap 
studies are even mildly abnormal, there is a high 
chance of having an abnormal overnight sleep study. 
This study also suggests that nap studies underestimate 
the abnormalities detected by ONP, even when 
children were sedated with chloral hydrate. Since 
REM sleep is infrequently seen in daytime nap 
studies, the higher incidence of sleep-disordered 
breathing seen in overnight studies may be due, in 
part, to the increased REM sleep. 

There have been several studies in adults that have 
correlated short daytime (nap) or partial-night studies 
with overnight studies. However, none of those 
studies evaluated individual parameters in the nap 
studies. Sanders et al4 compared the first half of an 
overnight sleep study to a whole night study in 48

adult patients. They found that apnea index, apnea 
hypopnea index, and desaturation event frequency 
had high sensitivities (87.9 to 93%), positive predictive 
values (93.6 to 100%), and specificities (86.7 to 
100%). Mizuma and colleagues5 compared daytime 
(3 h) and nocturnal polysomnography indexes of 
sleep, apnea index, and Sao2 in 30 adult patients.5 
They found no significant differences among the 
indexes, and there was a significant positive correlation 
between nocturnal and daytime polysomnography 
in all variables related to sleep apnea. Series and 
colleagues6 compared daytime and nocturnal PSGs 
in adults, and demonstrated that daytime sleep recordings 
were accurate in the diagnosis of sleep 
apnea syndrome, and of the types of apneas, but they 
were not reliable for the evaluation of sleep architecture. 
Carmona et al7 compared PSGs recorded 
over the first3hof nocturnal sleep to the entire 
night PSGs in patients suspected of having OSAS. In 
their study, 3-h nocturnal sleep studies had a sensitivity 
of 84% and specificity of 100%. They concluded 
that if polysomnography during first part of 
nocturnal sleep is negative, it should be continued 
throughout the entire night. Roberts and Hooper8 
reported similar results when comparing first4hof 
nocturnal sleep studies to full-night studies. They 
found that 4-h sleep studies were 100% sensitive and 
97% specific in identifying sleep apnea syndrome. 
The studies by Silvestri et al9 and Cordero et al10 
compared daytime PSGs to overnight studies and 
found that daytime sleep studies had good sensitivity 
and specificity, but concluded that ONP should be 
performed in the patients with presumed OSAS and 
negative daytime PSGs. The only study in the pediatric 
population, done by Marcus et al,3 showed that 
nap studies significantly underestimated the abnormalities 
detected by ONP. Our findings are consistent 
with this latter study. However, their study did 
not evaluate whether the individual nap study parameters 
might be able to predict the presence of 
OSAS in an overnight sleep study. 

The use of chloral hydrate was not associated with 
any side effects in our study. Thus, it was a safe 

medication when used to induce sleep in daytime 
studies in the uncomplicated patients in our study. It 
did not seem to cause sleep-disordered breathing. 
However, chloral hydrate should be used cautiously 
in patients who might be at high risk of upper airway 
obstruction (such as infants . 
3 months old, obese 
children, children with evidence of upper airway 
obstruction while awake, and patients with craniofacial 
anomalies), as chloral hydrate may precipitate 
upper airways obstruction.11 

We also found that a parent’s report about the 
presence of snoring, difficulty breathing, and apnea 
was neither very sensitive nor specific in predicting 
the presence of OSAS. However, a parent’s report 
about their children always having snoring and or 
difficulty breathing during sleep was much more 
sensitive in predicting the presence of OSAS. All 
these findings suggest that the diagnosis of OSAS 
cannot be accomplished by the history of these three 
symptoms alone.1,2 In addition, it is possible that 
some of the children who snore but had normal 
findings in ONP may have upper airway resistance 
syndrome. 

In pediatric sleep laboratories, nap studies are 
often used as a relatively inexpensive screening test. 
Since our study shows that nap studies often need to 
be confirmed by an overnight PSG, the potential cost 
advantages of nap studies may evaporate. Overnight 
PSGs have been shown to be a cost-effective diagnostic 
tool in adults.12 Our results suggest that the 
same may be true for children. 

We conclude that individual nap parameters are 
not very sensitive in predicting an abnormal overnight 
PSG. Hence, if a nap study is normal or only 
mildly abnormal, and the clinical suspicion is high, 
an overnight PSG should be performed to confirm 
the diagnosis of OSAS. The children who have even 
mildly abnormal nap studies tend to have more 
severe abnormalities on overnight PSGs. We speculate 
that in children with suspected OSAS secondary 
to adenotonsillar hypertrophy, any nap study with 
normal or mildly abnormal findings should always be 
confirmed by an overnight PSG.
