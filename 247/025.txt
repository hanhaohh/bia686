Abstract 

Background Neurobehavioural symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity are common in children 
with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Prevalence rates of habitual snoring and attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are very similar and both have a substantial negative effect on 
children’s behavioural health. 
Objective We examined the differences for subjective attentional and hyperactivity measures 
reported by parents and teachers among primary school children with habitual snoring and age- and 
sex-matched controls in a community-based case-control study in Istanbul. 
Methods In 2002, a survey was carried out to determine the prevalence of snoring in 2147 primary 
school children. After one year, in 2003, 151 children with habitual snoring and 302 controls from this 
survey were studied with parental SDB questionnaire, Conners’ Parent (Conners-P) and Teacher Scales, 
and an inattention hyperactivity scale (IHS). Exclusion criteria included history of ADHD diagnosis, 
controls who started to snore and habitual snorers (HS) who no longer snored in this follow-up study. 
Results Ninety-six HS and 190 control subjects (mean age: 9.4 ± 1.3) were evaluated. HS had 
significantly more symptoms of hyperactivity (Conners-ADHD index) (P: 0.033), attentional (P: 0.019), 
and conduct and oppositional defiant in subscales (P: 0.001) of Conners-P and IHS-Parents. A pooled 
score of Conners-P ADHD Index > 60 and IHS-Parent score > 1.25 showed considerable difference in 
HS when compared with controls (5.1% vs. 1.4%) (P < 0.0001). Daytime hyperactivity and excessive 
daytime sleepiness reported by parents correlated with scores of Conners-P and IHS-P (P < 0.01). 
Teachers’ observations showed significant correlations with learning disability and the level of 
academic performance in HS (P < 0.01). Other behavioural parameters related to SDB were not 
significantly correlated with teachers’ ADHD ratings in HS. 
Conclusion Increased rates of moderate hyperactivity as well as conduct and oppositional defiant 
symptoms in HS reported by the parents might reflect a negative impact on overall neurobehavioural 
health.The teachers’ scores yielded no significant results among HS and controls.This may be caused 
by the limitation due to shared method variance.The negative effect of crowded classes on teachers’ 
evaluations must be also taken into consideration. After exclusion of a diagnosis of ADHD in children

presenting with hyperactivity and inattention, children with habitual snoring with prominent scores 
of behavioural measures should be considered as candidates for further assessment by a sleep 

specialist. 

Introduction 

Frequent snoring is a common condition in prepubertal 
children affecting approximately 4.9–12% 
of all children of this age (Ferreira et al. 2000; 
Brunetti et al. 2001; Ersu et al. 2004; Kaditis et al. 
2004). Children who snore but do not fulfil the 
criteria for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) are 
considered to have primary snoring, i.e. habitual 
snoring (O’Brien et al. 2004) which might indicate 
the presence of increased upper airway resistance 
without alterations in alveolar oxygenation (Praud 
2004). Clinical sleep studies report that behavioural 
problems that resemble attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are common 
among children with sleep-disordered breathing 
(SDB) problems (Chervin et al. 2002; O’Brien et al. 
2003). 

Increased work of breathing, sleep fragmentation 
and intermittent hypoxaemia in SDB are the 
possible contributing factors for the alterations in 
the neurochemical substrate of the prefrontal cortex 
that may result in executive dysfunction (Beebe 
& Gozal 2002; O’Brien & Gozal 2002). 

ADHD is the most frequently encountered paediatric 
neurodevelopmental disorder with the 
prevalence of 3–12% (Dulcan 1997; Scahill & 
Schwab-Stone 2000), and in some occasions unrecognized 
medical conditions underlie the problematic 
behaviour, including SDB (Accardo 1999; 
Gozal et al. 2004). SDB can lead to ADHD-like 
symptoms in home recognized by parents 
(Gottlieb et al. 2003; O’Brien et al. 2003) or school 
settings described by teachers (Gozal 1998; Urschitz 
et al. 2003) that can be misperceived and 
potentially delay the diagnosis of both SDB and 
related psychiatric morbidity. 

Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 
fourth edition (DSM-IV) category C symptoms 
of ADHD diagnostic criteria entail that the 
symptoms must be present in both home and 

school environment (APA 1994). However, studies 
that evaluate ADHD in relation to SDB are conducted 
either using parent or teacher assessments 
(O’Brien & Gozal 2002; Schechter 2002). Thus, 
there is a strong need for an evaluation of the 
symptoms of ADHD in habitual snorers (HS) in 
both home and school settings at the same time. 

The aim of our study was to examine the differences 
for hyperactivity and attentional measures 
between primary school children with habitual 
snoring, and age- and sex-matched controls in a 
community-based case-control study. 

Methods 

Study population 

Approval by the Regional Director of Education 
that serves as the Institute of Human Subject Protection 
Committee for the schools in Istanbul was 
obtained prior to the study. In May 2002, a survey 
was carried out to determine the prevalence of HS 
and related diurnal symptoms in 2147 primary 
school children in Istanbul (Ersu et al. 2004). 
Multistage randomized sampling was used for the 
determination of 72 schools out of nine districts. 
Those districts were randomly chosen from 32 
school districts in the city of Istanbul with the population 
of approximately 12 million people. The 
prevalence of HS in children aged 5–13 years was 
estimated to be 7.0% (n = 151) in this study (Ersu 
et al. 2004). After one year, in May 2003, 151 children 
with habitual snoring and two age- and sex-
matched controls (n = 302) for each HS from the 
initial prevalence study were studied. Exclusion criteria 
included the history of ADHD diagnosis 
reported by parents. While ADHD is a behavioural 
phenotype, it is usually presented with co-morbid 
conditions such as oppositional defiant, conduct 
problems and academic difficulties that may 
resemble the behavioural consequences of habitual 
snoring. Therefore, children were excluded from

both groups to avoid the over-interpretation of any 
association between snoring and behavioural 
problems. Controls that started to snore and HS 
that did not snore any longer are also excluded. 

Measures 

Parental SDB questionnaire 

A 55-item multiple-choice questionnaire formulated 
according to the Brouillette and colleagues’ 
(1982, 1984) and Carroll and colleagues’ (1995) 
guidelines were completed by the parents and provided 
information regarding sleep habits, nighttime 
symptoms (total sleep time, sleep latency, 
presence and frequency of snoring, restless sleep 
and sleep arousals), and daytime symptoms (sleepiness 
in different situations, learning disability, 
school performance and hyperactivity). An envelope 
containing the questionnaire, the behavioural 
assessments described below, and a personally 
addressed letter asking for parental consent were 
distributed to children at school with the help of 
their teachers to be filled in by their parents within 
3 days. Parents reported snoring and other measures 
on a 4-point scale: 0 (never), 1 (occasionally), 
2 (often) and 3 (always). Habitual snoring and 
hyperactivity were considered if they were reported 
by parents as either ‘often’ or ‘always’ on a 4-point 
Likert scale in parental SDB questionnaire. The stability 
of the questionnaire was tested on an independent 
sample of 65 school-aged children prior to 
the epidemiological survey (Ersu et al. 2004). 

Behavioural assessments 

Conners’ Parent Rating Scale-48 (CPRS) is a well-
validated, 48-item instrument that is widely 
accepted to identify ADHD behavioural problems 
in children (Conners 1997). The Turkish CPRS validation 
has been made by Dereboy and colleagues 
(1998), and yielded six factors such as oppositional, 
conduct, inattention, hyperactivity, anxious 
and psychosomatic. 

Conners’ Teacher Rating Scale-28 (CTRS) is a 
commonly used research and clinical tool for 
assessing children’s behaviour in the classroom and 
composed of 28 items (Goyette et al. 1978). The 

validation of Turkish CTRS was conducted by 
Sener and colleagues (1995), and includes three 
factors: inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity and 
conduct problems. Symptoms are rated by parents 
or teachers on a 4-point scale and raw scores are 
converted to age- and sex-adjusted t-scores. Factor 
totals are standardized with t-scores starting from 
0 to 100 points with a mean of 50 points and a 
standard deviation (SD) of 10 points. Scores that 
exceed this average by 1 SD (10 points) to 2 SD (20 
points) are commonly considered to reflect hyperactive 
behaviour. Both instruments contain an 
ADHD index, composed of 12 most relevant items 
that show symptomatology consistent with a diagnosis 
of ADHD (Conners 1999). In this study, both 
CPRS- and CTRS-ADHD indexes >60 were considered 
to represent hyperactive behaviour. 

An inattention hyperactivity scale (IHS) is 
derived from 18 DSM-IV category A symptoms of 
ADHD diagnostic criteria (APA 1994). The validity 
of the instrument in the assessment of ADHD 
behaviour has been well established (Gadow & 
Sprafkin 1994). Responses are given on a 4-point 
scale from 0 to 3 (0 = never, 1 = occasionally, 
2 = often, 3 = always). A mean item response, IHS 
score, greater than 1.25 was considered to be high 
in our study. IHS-P score and IHS-T score, respectively, 
for parents and teachers correspond to mean 
scores of 12 or more positive (i.e. =2 points for each 
item on 4-point scale) responses among the 18 
symptom-items of ADHD. Six symptoms among 
nine that relate to inattention and six among nine 
that relate to hyperactive-impulsive behaviour are 
needed to support the diagnosis of ADHD, combined 
type in DSM-IV (APA 1994). 

Both Conners’ ADHD index (O’Brien et al. 
2003) and IHS scores (Chervin et al. 1997, 2002) 
have been used in previous studies of SDB children. 
CTRS and IHS-T were filled out by teachers in 
3 days, and all the survey materials were collected 
back from the schools by researchers. 

Data analysis 

Statistical analysis was done using a statistical software 
package (Version 11.0 for Windows; SPSS, 
Chicago, IL). Comparisons of the demographic 
factors, SDB questionnaire variables, and behav

ioural scores of study groups were made with independent 
t-tests for continuous variables, or Fisher’s 
exact test for dichotomous variables. Bonferroni 
corrections were applied to control for multiple 
comparisons. 

Data were summarized with means and SD 
unless otherwise indicated. Correlation analyses 
were performed to evaluate potential relations 
between behavioural scores and sleep variables in 
parental SDB questionnaire. Conners’ and IHS 
Total T scores for parents and teachers were considered 
to reflect hyperactive behaviour in correlation 
analyses. The level of significance was set at 
P < 0.05, unless otherwise stated. 

Results 

Subjects 

Response rate was 85.9%; 306 out of total 453 SDB 
questionnaires were fully completed, returned and 
analysed. Forty-eight control children who started 
to snore on May 2003 and seven HS from prevalence 
study who did not snore any longer were 
excluded from their groups. There were 105 HS 
and 201 healthy controls that never snored in 2003. 

Eight and a half per cent of HS (n = 9) and 5.3% 
of controls (n = 11) who had a clinical diagnosis of 
ADHD reported by parents were excluded from 
both groups. Hence, there were 96 HS and 190 
controls evaluated for sleep variables and behavioural 
measures. There were equal amount of girls 
and boys in both groups and mean age was 

9.4 ± 1.3 (range: 7.1–13.5) for all the participants. 
Mean ages were similar for both HS and control 
groups. HS was common in the 7- to 10-year age 
group (61.5%), and the percentage was lower in the 
10- to 13-year age group (38.6%). The distribution 
of HS in girls and boys in different age groups did 
not differ. Nine school districts consisted of 72 
schools with different socio-economic levels and 
ranged from very poor to upscale neighbourhoods. 
Maternal educational level, occupation and smoking 
rates were similar in both groups. 
Table 1 outlines the demographic characteristics 
of HS and controls. 

Parental SDB questionnaire 

Table 2 shows parental SDB questionnaire findings 
in both groups. Parental anxiety during child’s 
sleep was more than three times likely in HS than

controls (P < 0.0001). Sleepiness score, mean score 
of the sum of ‘often’ or ‘always’ answers to the questions 
such as ‘Does your child feel sleepy in different 
conditions such as in public places, during 
watching TV, or playing with friends?’, was twofold 
higher in HS than controls (P < 0.0001). Particularly, 
sleepiness during watching TV was significantly 
increased in HS group (P: 0.001). Parents 
were asked if their child looked restless, fidgety or 
hyperactive most of the time during day and 44 of 
HS children’s mothers answered as either ‘often’ or 
‘always’ (P < 0.0001). Hyperactivity reported as 
‘sometimes’ might reflect moderate levels of 
increased activity during daytime and was reported 
as 26.4% in HS vs. 12.1% in controls (P: 0.006). 
Although the rates of learning disability (i.e. 
reading, writing, and both) did not differ among 
groups; specific reading disorder was reported as 
7.8% in HS, in contrast to 3.0% of controls (P: 
0.054). The answer to the question of ‘What do you 
think about your child’s academic performance?’ 
was scored from ‘failure (0)’ to ‘successful (3)’ in a 
4-point scale. The percentages of results from poor 

(1) to successful (3) did not change among groups. 
Although school failure was reported nearly twice 
more in HS, the difference was not significant. 
Behavioural assessments 

The results of behavioural assessments reported by 
parents and teachers are shown in Table 3. HS per


formed significantly worse than control subjects on 
several subscales of Conners’ and IHS. Mean t-
scores were within normal range for both groups. 
All of the significant differences were in the 
parental scale scores of hyperactivity, inattention, 
conduct and oppositional defiant symptoms. The 
pooled score of CPRS-ADHD index +1 SD and 
IHS > 1.25 was positive in 5.1% of HS while only 
1.4% of normal children showed positive scores 
(P < 0.0001). However, teachers’ pooled scores 
were high in both groups (10.9% and 9.5% in HS 
and controls, respectively). 

Relationship between behavioural function and 
parental SDB questionnaire 

The correlations between the behaviour scores and 
SDB questionnaire variables in 96 HS subjects are 
shown in Table 4. Parents’ and teachers’ Conners’ 
Rating Scales and DSM-IV ADHD criteria (IHS 
scores) were chosen to reflect hyperactive behaviour. 
Daytime hyperactivity, learning disability and 
sleepiness while watching television were significantly 
correlated with parent scores. Level of academic 
performance was negatively correlated with 
all behavioural domains. Teacher ratings showed 
significant correlations with learning disability 
(positively) and level of academic performance 
(negatively). Other variables of SDB outlined in 
Table 2 did not correlate with hyperactive behaviours 
reported by teachers.

to one-third of all children with frequent snoring 
display significant hyperactivity and inattention 
(Ali et al. 1993; Chervin et al. 2002). Similarly, 
habitual snoring was found to be associated with 
an increased likelihood of hyperactivity in our 
study (14.6–24.1% and 1.4–6.5% in HS and control 
subjects, respectively). 

On the contrary, Janusz (1999) and Cooper and 
colleagues (2004) both reported that the sleep 
abnormalities of SDB and ADHD had no contributions 
to one another. They concluded that minimal 
attentional difficulties demonstrated by 
children may suggest attention-seeking behaviours 
rather than ADHD. Although Cooper and colleagues 
(2004) included polysomnography (PSG) 
evaluations, both studies consisted of small study 
populations which may not efficiently show the 
relationship between ADHD behaviours and SDB. 

Conduct and oppositional problems reported in 
behavioural scales were notably higher in HS in our 
study. In a prospective study of 872 children evaluated 
by parental rating scales, Chervin and colleagues 
(2003) concluded that bullying and other 
explicit aggressive behaviours were generally two to 
three times more frequent among children at high 
risk for SDB than among remaining children. 
Studies of children with SDB suggested that inattentive, 
hyperactive and aggressive behaviour are 
all essential components of sleep disturbances 
(Guilleminault et al. 1982). The current hypothesis 
is that sleep fragmentation resulting from recurrent 
arousals may result in prefrontal cortex dysfunction 
at vulnerable periods of brain 
development, therefore reflecting as executive 
dysfunction in pre-pubertal children (Beebe & 
Gozal 2002). ADHD, conduct and oppositional 
defiant disorders have been found to co-occur in 
30–50% of cases in both epidemiologic and clinical 
samples (Biederman et al. 1991). The typical age of 
onset of both disorders is also pre-pubertal like 
SDB and ADHD, therefore careful diagnosis of 
conduct and oppositional defiant disorders may be 
crucial for timely intervention to prevent social 
dysfunction (Spencer et al. 1999). 

We emphasized the importance of obtaining 
teachers’ observations in the methods section for 
evaluating behavioural symptoms of ADHD, and 
we expected significant results from teacher scales. 

However, no significant difference was found in 
behavioural scales at school setting between the 
two study groups. The guidelines (Dulcan 1997; 
AAP 2000) suggest that the diagnosis of ADHD 
must include core symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity 
and impulsivity in more than one setting 
to meet DSM-IV criteria (Conners 1999). The 
validity and reliability measures of Turkish version 
of CTRS are well established (Sener et al. 1995). On 
the other hand, the discriminative power of teachers’ 
ADHD ratings seems to stem from teachers’ 
opportunity to observe children objectively during 
class work (Hinsaw 1987). In our study, the rating 
quality may be negatively effected as the classes 
were overcrowded (>40 students in a class) and the 
educational programme was highly loaded. We 
may speculate that teachers have answered the 
items rapidly and rated both the HS and control 
groups with quite high behavioural scores of 
ADHD. In our study, the rates of hyperactivity 
reported by teachers (i.e. pooled ADHD scores) 
were similarly high in both HS (10.9%) and controls 
(9.5%). These results make contrast to the 
rates of hyperactivity reported by parents using the 
similar scales (5.1% for HS, and 1.4% for controls). 

Why teacher data yielded no significant findings 
while parental ratings were significantly different 
could be explained due to artefacts resulted from 
shared method variance. That is to say, the relationship 
between parent-reported sleep and parent-
reported behavioural functioning might be a 
function of common reporter, also called as 
‘reporter bias’. This effect is quite prominent in 
correlational analyses where teachers’ scores significantly 
correlated with only learning disability and 
level of academic performance in our study. On the 
contrary, parental behavioural scores were significantly 
correlated with most of the parent-reported 
sleep variables. 

Both teachers’ and parents’ behavioural scores 
were significantly correlated with learning disability 
and level of academic performance in HS, when 
correlational analyses were performed. However, 
we found no differences in academic achievement 
and overall learning disability between the two 
groups. One explanation to this might be the percentages 
of results from poor to successful were 
similar among groups, except school failure was

Inattention and hyperactivity in habitual snoring 715 

reported nearly twice more in HS. In contrast, 
habitual snoring was associated with poor academic 
performance in Urschitz’s study (Urschitz 
et al. 2003) of 1144 children. Schooling problems 
have been repeatedly reported in children with 
SDB (Gozal 1998; Gozal & Pope 2001), and 
improvements in learning have been reported 
following treatment for SDB in children (Gozal 
1998). Analysing the associations between academic 
problems and HS were not the primary prospective 
aim of our study protocol. A more precise 
evaluation of academic scoring similar to the 
method of Urschitz and colleagues (2003) might 
help yield more consistent results. Therefore, our 
findings on academic problems have a need of 
verification with further comprehensive cognitive 
assessments. 

Increased rates of excessive daytime sleepiness 
were significantly more often in HS when compared 
with controls. In a cross-sectional study of 
Melendres and colleagues (2004), both the sleepiness 
and Conners’ scores were higher in primary 
school children with suspected SDB in contrast to 
controls. Daytime sleepiness, hyperactivity and 
restless sleep were all significantly more common 
in the HS than in those who never snored in a 
community-based study (Ali et al. 1994). Restless 
sleep may contribute to difficulties with attentional 
focus and can imitate the components of ADHD 
(Accardo 1999). Children having ADHD symptoms 
with a medical history of frequent snoring 
and restless sleep should be candidates for a paediatric 
respiratory consultation to rule out significant 
upper airway obstruction. 

A potentially serious consequence of intermittent 
hypoxia during sleep may involve its long-
term effects on neuronal function, such as neuronal 
loss through programmed cell death within pre-
frontal cortex (Beebe & Gozal 2002). Even in the 
absence of OSA, snoring is associated with significant 
deficits in neurobehavioural function in children 
(Blunden et al. 2000; O’Brien et al. 2004). 
Recent studies have shown that primary snoring is 
not as ‘benign’ as was first thought and is associated 
with cognitive problems, including reduced verbal 
and total intelligence scores, reduced attention and 
memory deficits (Kennedy et al. 2004). In our previous 
study (Ersu et al. 2004), both habitual and 

high-risk snorers had similar high rates of daytime 
sleepiness and hyperactivity although their physical 
symptoms such as blue colouring during sleep and 
observed apnoea were significantly reported in 
favour of high-risk group. 

Limitations 

Our study mainly relied on parental and teacher 
reports rather than objectively collected sleep measures 
such as PSG. Our habitual snoring group 
most probably include OSA cases, as current evidence 
suggest up to 12–15% (AAP 2000) HS may 
indeed be diagnosed as OSA by means of PSG. 
Overnight PSG is recognized as the gold standard 
for the diagnosis of OSA (Schechter 2002). On the 
other hand, Montgomery-Downs and colleagues 
(2004) concluded that parental-report questionnaires 
of habitual snoring can be used as substitute 
predictors of SDB behaviours, provided that careful 
attention is paid to age and risk states, and aim 
of screening. 

As discussed earlier, reporter bias has to be mentioned 
as a limitation in our study. Although we 
included teacher reports besides parental observations 
of sleep and behaviour, teacher data did not 
yield significant results among groups. So the possibility 
of artefacts due to shared method variance 
remains. 

When our study subjects are taken into consideration, 
further face-to-face assessment of HS with 
the possible ADHD diagnosis would help to illuminate 
the relationship between habitual snoring 
and ADHD. 

Conclusions 

Habitual snoring is related to considerable behavioural 
problems including ADHD symptoms when 
compared with children who never snored. Cooccurrence 
of sleep awakenings, excessive daytime 
sleepiness and hyperactivity in children with habitual 
snoring should alarm physicians for further 
medical assessments. After excluding ADHD and 
any other psychopathology with clinical interview, 
children with habitual snoring who have elevated 
scores of Conner’s and IHS should be considered 
for further evaluation by a sleep specialist.
