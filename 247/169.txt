Study Objectives: In adults, sleep apnea is worse when the patient is in 
the supine position. However, the relationship between sleep position and 
obstructive apnea in children is unknown. The objective of this study was 
to evaluate the relationship between obstructive apnea and body position 
during sleep in children. 
Design: Retrospective analysis of the relationship between body position 
and obstructive apnea in obese and non-obese children. 
Setting: Tertiary care pediatric sleep center. 
Patients: Otherwise healthy children, aged 1-10 years, undergoing 
polysomnography for suspected obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. 
Obese and non-obese children were evaluated separately. 
Interventions: Retrospective review of the relationship between sleep 
position and obstructive apnea during polysomnography. 

Measurements and Results: Eighty polysomnograms from 56 non-
obese and 24 obese children were analyzed. Body position was determined 
by a sensor during polysomnography, and confirmed by review of 
videotapes. Children had a lower obstructive apnea hypopnea index 
when supine vs. prone, and shorter apneas when supine then when on 
their side. There was no difference in apnea duration between the supine 
and prone positions. Obese and non-obese children showed similar positional 
changes. 
Conclusions: Children with obstructive sleep apnea, in contrast to adults, 
breathe best when in the supine position.

INTRODUCTION 

THE OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEPAPNEASYNDROME (OSAS) IS 
COMMON DURING CHILDHOOD, OCCURRING IN 
APPROXIMATELY 2% OF PRESCHOOL CHILDREN.1 It can 
result in significant morbidity.2 Nevertheless, the factors affecting 
the severity of OSAS in children have not been thoroughly 
studied. 

In adults, snoring and obstructive apnea are well known to be 
worse in the supine position.3-5 In fact, mild OSAS is often treated 
with positional therapy, and techniques such as attaching tennis 
balls to the back of pajamas have been advocated to prevent 
patients from lying supine.3 The effect of position on obstructive 
apnea in children older than infancy has not been studied. 
However, it has been our clinical impression that parents of children 
with OSAS do not report increased snoring or apnea when 
their child sleeps in the supine position. We therefore hypothesized 
that sleep position does not affect the severity of upper airway 
obstruction in children with uncomplicated OSAS. 

In most children, OSAS is associated with adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy. These children are usually of normal weight, or 
may even have failure to thrive.6 The subgroup of obese children

with OSAS may have a similar pathophysiology to adults with 
OSAS, most of whom are obese. We therefore hypothesized that 
the effect of position on sleep-disordered breathing would differ 
between obese and non-obese children. 

Consequently, we retrospectively analyzed the relationship 
between sleep position and obstructive apnea in obese and non-
obese children with OSAS. 

METHODS 

Study Group 

We retrospectively analyzed consecutive overnight 
polysomnograms with an apnea hypopnea index =1 performed at 
the Johns Hopkins Pediatric Sleep Center. Studies from otherwise-
healthy, prepubertal children aged 1-10 years, referred for 
evaluation of suspected OSAS, were evaluated. Ten years was 
used as the higher age cut-off as Tanner pubertal ratings were not 
available for this retrospective review. Infants were excluded as 
they would be expected to have anatomic and physiologic differences 
compared to older children. All children had OSAS related 
to adenotonsillar hypertrophy and/or obesity. Children with 
craniofacial anomalies, neuromuscular disease, a history of upper 
airway surgery or any major medical illnesses other than OSAS 
were excluded. Subject identifiers were not maintained. 

Patients were then separated into obese and non-obese subgroups. 
Growth percentiles were obtained using standard growth 
charts (National Center for Health Statistics, adapted by Ross 
Laboratories). Children were defined as obese if their weight was 
greater than 120% of their ideal weight for height.7 

Polysomnography 

Polysomnography was performed on a Respironics Alice 
System (Pittsburgh, PA) and consisted of electroencephalogram

also monitored and recorded on videotape, using an infrared 
video camera, and were continuously observed by a polysomnography 
technician. Children accompanied by a parent arrived in 
the laboratory at 20:00, and studies were terminated at 5:00. 

Assessment of Body Position 

Patients were allowed to spontaneously assume body positions. 
They were categorized as being in the prone, supine, or 
side position based on the position of their torso. Head and neck 
position was not considered. Body position was identified primarily 
by the Alice position sensor, situated on the thoracic belt. 
This was double-checked by reviewing the technician study 
notes. All technicians routinely filled out a flow sheet in which 
body position was entered in a dedicated column every hour. In 
addition, for the first ten patients, body position was confirmed 
by review of videotapes. In all cases, the videotape agreed with 
the body sensor. 

The Alice System body position sensor utilizes a mercury tilt 
and vibration switch to determine the position of the patient. The 
switch design consists of 12 electrically isolated contacts that are 

spaced thirty degrees apart in a circle around the periphery of the 
switch. A ball of mercury is in the center of this circle of contacts. 
As the switch is rotated, the mercury ball will make contact 
with one or more of the 12 contacts, thereby indicating the 
body position. 

Data Analysis 

All polysomnograms were scored by a registered sleep technologist 
and subsequently reviewed by a physician experienced 
in pediatric sleep medicine. All data were analyzed by a single 
investigator (LBP). Standard criteria were used for scoring sleep 
architecture.8,9 Respiratory events were scored using accepted 
pediatric standards.10 As children have a higher respiratory frequency 
than adults, and frequently desaturate even with short 
apneas, all obstructive apneas greater than or equal to two breaths 
duration were counted.11 Hypopneas were defined as a qualitative 
reduction in thermistor airflow =50% in the presence of paradoxical 
respiratory efforts, associated with desaturation =3% 
and/or arousal.12 The obstructive apnea hypopnea index (OAHI) 
was defined as the number of hypopneas and obstructive and 
mixed apneas per hour of total sleep time. For the purpose of this 
study, any polysomnogram with at least one obstructive event per 
hour was evaluated. Central apneas were not analyzed due to the 
very small number of central apneas present. 

Statistical Methods 

Statistical analysis was performed using STATA version 6.0.13 
Histograms and box plots were created for outcome measures to 
show the data spread and help identify outlying observations. 
Categorical patient demographic information was compared 
between obese and non-obese patients using the chi-squared 
goodness-of-fit test. Two-sided t-tests for independent samples 
were performed when comparing the means of normally distributed 
continuous variables for the obese and non-obese groups, 
while the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was performed for comparing 
the distributions of non-normally distributed continuous variables 
between these two groups. Because sleep and apnea variables 
were recorded for each child in the three positions, we 
expected that outcome measures would be correlated within the 
individual patient. In order to take this correlation into account, 
regression analyses of apnea on body position were performed 
using generalized estimating equations (GEE method).14 Since 
apnea events consist of count data, the regression of apnea on 
position was modeled by using the Poisson distribution with an 
offset for time in each position. Because the data were over-dispersed, 
the Huber-White robust estimator of variance was used to 
obtain proper estimates of the standard errors for the regression 
coefficients.15 In the regression analysis, an indicator variable for 
position was placed in the model, with the supine position being 
the base of comparison. The STATA procedure lincom, which 
calculates point estimates and confidence intervals for linear 
combinations of regression coefficients, was used to allow us to 
compare relative rates of apnea between the side and prone positions.
15 We also controlled for age and obesity in this analysis. 
Some patients did not have any prone sleep. Therefore, an indicator 
variable of 1 (prone sleep present) vs. 0 (no prone sleep 
occurred) was used to analyze whether apnea in other positions 
differed between those patients with some prone sleep versus

RESULTS 

Study Group 

Studies from 80 children (56 non-obese and 24 obese) were 
analyzed. Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. The obese 
group was significantly older and more likely to be female and 
African American than the non-obese group. However, sleep 
characteristics and the degree of sleep-disordered breathing were 
similar between the two groups, except for a slight decrease in 
REM sleep in the obese population. 

Total Sleep Time and Position 

There was no difference in total sleep time between obese and 
non-obese patients (Table 1). Children slept predominantly in the 

side position, followed by the supine and prone positions (Table 
2; p<0.0001 for supine vs. prone, prone vs. side and supine vs. 
side). There was no significant difference in the time spent in 
each position between non-obese and obese patients. 

Obstructive Apnea Index and Position 

The OAHI did not differ significantly between the two groups 
(Table 1). Although it did not quite reach statistical significance, 
there was a tendency for obese patients to have a higher OAHI 
during supine sleep than non-obese patients (14 [2,20] vs. 4 [1,9] 
/hr, p=0.053); no difference was observed between the two 
groups in the other positions. For the group as a whole, the 
OAHI in different positions is shown in Figure 1. Table 3 shows 
the total apnea number and sleep times in different positions used 
for calculating the generalized estimating equations. For the 
group as a whole, the relative risk of apnea in the prone position 
was 1.68 (95% C.I. 1.05, 2.69; p=0.031) compared to the supine 
position. There was no significant difference in OAHI between 
the other positions. These results were similar when the model 
was adjusted for those patients who spent any time prone vs. 
those who had no prone time. Similar results were noted for the 
obese subgroup, and when age was added into the model. 

Duration of Obstructive Apnea and Position 

There was no significant difference in the mean apnea/hypopnea 
duration between non-obese and obese patients (10 [9,13] vs. 
10 [8,12] seconds, respectively). Mean duration did not differ 
significantly between the two groups in any particular position. 
For the group as a whole, the mean apnea duration was 12 (10,14) 
seconds in the prone position, 11 (10,14) seconds in the side position, 
and 11 (9,13) seconds in the supine position. In order to 
determine whether significant differences existed between different 
positions after controlling for obesity, regression analysis was 
performed. This showed a significant increase in apnea duration 
in the side vs. the supine position (p=0.034). There was no significant 
difference in duration of apnea between the prone and 
supine or prone and side positions.

Effect of REM Sleep 

The effect of REM sleep was analyzed separately. Obese 
patients had slightly less REM sleep (Table 1). However, there 
was no significant difference between obese and non-obese children 
in the REM time in each position (Table 2). As with total 
sleep time, during REM the children slept mainly on their side, 
followed by the supine and prone positions (Table 2). Analyses 
were therefore limited by the short amount of time spent in the 
non-side positions. Two percent of children had no REM sleep 
on their side, 23% had no REM sleep supine and 55% had no 
REM sleep prone. The amount of REM sleep differed significantly 
between all three positions controlling for obesity 
(p=0.001 for prone vs. supine; p<0.001 for side vs supine and 
p<0.001 for side vs prone), and between obese and non-obese 
groups controlling for position (p=0.023). 

The OAHI was higher during REM sleep than over the entire 
sleep period (14 [6,34] vs 4 [2,12]hr, p<0.001), consistent with 
previous reports.16 There was no significant difference in REM 
OAHI between obese and non-obese groups, and no significant 
effect of body position on REM apnea index. 

There was no significant difference in the mean REM apnea 
duration between non-obese and obese patients (17 [12,20] vs. 17 
[11,21] seconds, respectively). Mean duration did not differ 
between obese and non-obese children in each position. 
Regression analysis showed that REM apnea duration was significantly 
longer in the side than the supine position (p=0.022) 
after controlling for obesity. No significant differences were 
found between the side and prone position, or between the obese 
and non-obese groups. 

DISCUSSION 

The main finding of this study is that children with OSAS 
breathed best when supine. Children had fewer obstructive 
apneas when they were supine compared to prone, and the apneas 
were shorter in the supine position. Thus, the pattern of obstructive 
apnea in children is very different from that of adults, who 
have consistently been shown to have less apnea when in the 

SLEEP, Vol. 25, No. 1, 2002 

prone position. Contrary to expectations, obese children had a 
similar pattern to non-obese children. Although significant positional 
differences in OAHI were not noted during REM sleep 
(possibly due to the limited amount of time spent in the non-side 
position during REM), apneas were shorter in the supine position 
during REM. 

In adults, obstructive apneas are more frequent and longer 
when patients sleep in the supine position compared to the side 
position (most studies in adults did not evaluate the prone position 
due to the short duration of time spent in that position).3-5 
This clinical finding has been corroborated by physiologic studies 
showing a higher critical closing pressure (Pcrit) in the supine 
compared to the lateral position.17 In contrast, the current study 
shows that children obstruct least when supine. To the best of our 
knowledge, there are no previous studies evaluating the effect of 
position on obstructive apnea in young children. However, data 
on infants support our findings in older children. Although sleep 
position in infants has not been shown to significantly affect the 
rate or duration of central or obstructive apneas,18,19 preliminary 
data suggest that the infant upper airway is more collapsible 
when the infant is prone.20 This may be one of the factors 
accounting for the increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome 
(SIDS) in the prone position.21,22 

In this study, the children with OSAS were most likely to sleep 
on their side, followed by supine and prone. Thus, their sleep 
position preferences were similar to that of normal children.23 

The mechanism for the positional change in obstructive apnea 
is unclear. Although awake adults with OSAS have narrowing of 
the upper airway when in the supine position compared to being 
erect,24 upper airway dimensions are similar in the supine and lateral 
recumbent positions.25 Furthermore, studies during wakefulness 
may not accurately reflect changes that occur during 
sleep. In adults, the supine position can lead to prolapse of the 
mandible, along with the base of the tongue, leading to upper airway 
obstruction.26 In children with OSAS, obstruction usually 
occurs at the levels of the adenoids or soft palate, rather than the 
tongue;27 thus, prolapse of the tongue is probably less important. 
It is possible that external pressure from the bedding materials on 

69 Sleep Position in Childhood OSAS—Fernandes do Prado et al 


the mandible in the prone position may cause posterior displacement 
of the mandible, compromising the airway. Another possibility 
is that children have a decreased lung capacity when prone, 
due to pressure on a compliant thorax. Decreases in lung capacity 
have been shown to result in narrowing of the upper air


way.28,29 

Alternatively, children with OSAS may do worse in the 
prone position because the dependent tonsils become more congested. 
None of these mechanisms, however, would explain the 
differences between the supine and lateral positions. Another 
possibility is that children in the prone or lateral position have 
flexion of their neck, which can lead to increased upper airway 
collapsibility.30,31 In the current, retrospective study, we were 
unable to assess the degree of neck flexion or rotation. It is 
unlikely that the increase in obstructive apnea noted in non-
supine positions was due to artifact. Two sensors of airflow 
(thermistor and end-tidal PCO2) were used. Furthermore, 
obstructive events were all associated with paradoxical breathing, 
and frequently with desaturation and/or arousal; and patients 
were observed on video, with obstructive breathing documented 
by the technicians. 

There are some technical limitations to this study. This was a 
retrospective study, with no standardization of body position. 
Furthermore, the position of the head and neck was not assessed. 
Therefore, a prospective study evaluating body position is warranted. 
Study groups were not directly comparable, as the obese 
children were more likely to be older, female, and African 
American than the non-obese children. This is not surprising, as 
it is consistent with current demographic trends.32 However, 
polysomnographic data were comparable between the obese and 
non-obese groups, with the only difference being the percentage 
of REM time. 

This study included patients with OSAS secondary to adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy or obesity only. Children with OSAS secondary 
to craniofacial disease were excluded, due to the heterogenousity 
of the conditions represented. Some patients with 
craniofacial anomalies are thought to have improved breathing in 
the prone condition, particularly patients with micrognathia or 
macroglossia.33,34 The findings of this study, therefore, should 
not be extrapolated to patients with craniofacial anomalies. 

In summary, we have shown that children with OSAS breathe 
best when in the supine condition. This was a retrospective study 
with a relatively small sample size, and further, prospective studies 
are warranted. In the interim, however, we recommend that 
consideration be made to encourage children with OSAS to sleep 
in the supine position pending treatment. However, as obstructive 
apneas occurred in all positions, definitive therapy other than 
positioning is required.
