Tonsils; 
Tonsil surgery;

Snoring; 
Sleep apnea 
Objective: 
To compare the long-term effects (six years after surgery) of two techniques 
for pediatric tonsil surgery with respect to snoring, apneas, eating difficulties, 
infections and general health. The two methods were intracapsular partial tonsillectomy 
(tonsillotomy, ‘‘TT’’) using CO2-laser technique and traditional (total) blunt 
dissection tonsillectomy (TE). 
Study 
design: 
Aquestionnaire distributed by mail to the parents of children, who, in 
1998, were included in a prospective clinical randomized study in one tertiary care 
ENT clinic. 
Method: 
A 10 question survey follow-up of 41 children, between 9 and 15 years of 
age, who originally, six years earlier had been randomized to either TTwith CO2-laser 
(n 
= 21) or TE (n 
= 20). The main indication for the surgery was a history of sleep 
related breathing distress (SRBD). Before the present study, all of the children had 
participated in earlier follow-ups at six months and one year after surgery. 
Results: 
All the children in both groups answered the questionnaire. There were no 
significant differences between the answers from the two groups in any respects: the 
effect on snoring and apneas was equally stable for both groups. The number of 
children who remained free from snoring decreased from 40 after the first year to 25 
after six years (11 TT, 14 TE). Snoring in the recurrent cases was not rated to be as 
frequent or as loud as before the surgery. Infections of the upper respiratory tract 
(URI) that had been treated with antibiotics occurred to the same extent in both 
groups. None had eating difficulties. The patients’ satisfaction with the results of the

1. 
Introduction 
In 
most 
countries 
in 
the 
world, 
tonsillectomy 
is 
still 
one 
of 
the 
most 
common 
surgical 
procedures 
performed 
on 
children 
[1]. 
Conventional 
tonsillectomy, 
still 
the 
most 
common 
in 
Scandinavia, 
has 
a 
high 
post-operative 
morbidity: 
post-operative 
pain, 
that 
is 
difficult 
to 
relieve 
adequately 
during 
the 
first 
week, 
causing 
eating 
difficulties 
and 
catabolism 
during 
the 
healing 
period. 
Approximately 
2% 
of 
the 
patients 
experience 
post-operative 
hemorrhage. 
Many 
different 
approaches 
have 
been 
tried 
in 
attempts 
to 
reduce 
the 
post-operative 
pain 
(in 
particular, 
local 
anesthesia, 
steroids 
and 
antibiotics), 
but 
without 
convincing 
effects 
[2]. 


Several 
techniques, 
based 
mostly 
on 
electrosurgery, 
have 
been 
developed 
as 
alternatives 
to 
traditional 
blunt 
dissection. 
A 
recent 
study 
shows 
that 
currently 
about 
50% 
of 
the 
American 
ENT 
specialists 
use 
one 
or 
another 
electrosurgical 
options 
for 
tonsillectomy 
[3]. 
These 
methods 
all 
seem 
to 
work 
well 
for 
the 
removal 
of 
the 
tonsils 
with 
less 
bleeding, 
but 
they 
do 
not 
necessarily 
reduce 
the 
post-operative 
pain 
[4—7]. 


Five 
years 
ago, 
we 
presented 
the 
first 
randomized 
study 
demonstrating 
that 
the 
post-operative 
morbidity 
is 
markedly 
reduced 
if 
a 
TT 
(intracapsular 
partial 
tonsil 
resection) 
is 
performed 
with 
CO2-laser 
[8]. 
Since 
then, 
this 
method 
has 
been 
in 
use 
at 
several 
clinics 
in 
Sweden 
[9,10]. 
However, 
the 
question 
is 
whether 
a 
partial 
resection 
in 
the 
long 
run 
is 
as 
effective 
as 
a 
complete 
tonsillectomy? 
How 
high 
is 
the 
risk 
for 
regrowth 
of 
the 
remaining 
tonsillar 
tissue, 
and 
thereby, 
recurrence 
of 
the 
patient’s 
symptoms? 
Is 
the 
risk 
for 
throat 
infections 
higher 
after 
TT 
than 
after 
TE? 


The 
purpose 
of 
the 
present 
study 
is 
to 
evaluate 
the 
long-term 
effects 
(after 
six 
years) 
of 
TT 
performed 
with 
CO2-laser 
on 
children 
with 
tonsillar 
hypertrophy 
and 
symptoms 
of 
obstruction 
in 
comparison 
with 
results 
after 
conventional 
tonsillectomies. 


2. 
Method 
The 
study 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
local 
Ethics 
Committee 
of 
Uppsala 
University. 


The 
families 
of 
the 
41 
children, 
now 
aged 
9—15 
years, 
who 
participated 
in 
a 
randomized 
study 
conducted 
in 
the 
ENT 
Department 
at 
the 
University 
Hospital 
in 
Uppsala, 
1998, 
were 
contacted 
by 
mail 
and 
asked 
to 
answer 
a 
10-question 
questionnaire 
concerning 
the 
current 
health 
of 
the 
operated 
child. 
The 
questionnaire 
(Table 
1) 
was 
about 
general 
health, 
snoring, 
sleep 
apneas, 
eating 
difficulties 
and 
infections. 
All 
the 
symptoms 
were 
evaluated 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
child’s 
condition 
before 
surgery. 
Finally, 
the 
parents 
were 
asked 
if 
they 
were 
satisfied 
with 
the 
results 
of 
the 
operation. 
The 
validity 
of 
the 
questionnaire 
has 
not 
been 
tested, 
but 
all 
the 
participants 
had 
answered 
the 
same 
questions 
during 
the 
previous 
two 
follow-ups 
(at 
six 
months 
and 
one 
year 
after 
surgery). 


3. 
Statistics 
Since 
the 
answers 
to 
the 
questionnaire 
yielded 
non-
parametric 
data, 
Chi-square 
and 
Mann—Whitney 
tests 
(MW) 
were 
used. 
Because 
of 
the 
small 
number 
of 
patients 
included 
in 
the 
study, 
the 
power 
for 
nonsignificant 
results 
is 
limited. 


4. 
Results 
Details 
about 
the 
randomization 
and 
inclusion 
of 
patients 
can 
be 
found 
in 
a 
previous 
paper 
[8]. 
All 
the 
patients 
participating 
in 
the 
original 
study 
answered 
the 
questionnaire. 
The 
answers 
were 
compared 
with 
the 
answers 
to 
same 
question 
given 
after 
six 
months, 
and 
one 
year. 


The 
overall 
ratings 
of 
the 
children’s 
health 
after 
six 
years 
compared 
with 
the 
preoperative 
condition 
are 
shown 
in 
Fig. 
1. 
The 
difference 
between 
the 
TT 
and 
TE 
groups 
is 
not 
significant 
(p 
= 
0.367, 
MW). 


After 
six 
months, 
no 
child 
was 
snoring, 
but 
after 
one 
year 
two 
children 
in 
the 
TT 
group 
had 
started 
to 
snore 
again. 
Now, 
after 
six 
years, 
eight 
TT 
children 
and 
four 
TE 
children 
had 
started 
to 
snore 
again, 
but 
to 
a 
lesser 
extent 
compared 
with 
before 
surgery 
(Fig. 
2 
a 
and 
b). 
The 
majority 
of 
the 
children 
were 
still 
‘‘free 
of 
snoring’’ (TT 
11, 
TE 
14). 
No 
child 
in 
either 
group 
had 
apneas 
one 
year 
after 
surgery,

to 
the 
parents. 
After 
six 
years, 
the 
parents 
of 
three 
children 
in 
the 
TT 
group 
and 
four 
children 
in 
the 
TE 
group 
indicated 
a 
moderate 
improvement 
with 
respect 
to 
apneas 
compared 
to 
pre-operatively, 
whereas 
the 
majority 
had 
no 
apneas 
(Fig. 
3). 


All 
children 
with 
eating 
problems 
before 
operation 
(n 
= 
26) 
had 
been 
cured 
in 
both 
groups 
immediately 
after 
surgery. 
After 
six 
years, 
one 
child 
(TT) 


was 
in 
treatment 
by 
a 
speech 
therapist 
for 
oral 
dysfunction 
with 
some 
eating 
difficulties. 


The 
tendency 
for 
upper 
respiratory 
tract 
infections 
(URI’s) 
was 
low 
in 
both 
groups 
(Fig. 
4). 
The 
number 
of 
URI’s, 
which 
had 
been 
treated 
with 
antibiotics 
over 
the 
six 
years 
since 
surgery, 
was 
20 
in 
the 
TT 
group 
and 
25 
in 
the 
TE 
group. 
The 
difference 
is 
not 
significant, 
40% 
of 
these 
infections 
were 
throat 
diseases 
and 
the 
rest 
mostly 
ear 
infections 
(Fig. 
5).

Discussion 
The 
results 
from 
this 
investigation 
demonstrate 
that 
tonsillotomy 
with 
CO2-laser 
is 
a 
technique 
for 
pediatric 
tonsil 
surgery 
that 
gives 
much 
less 
post-operative 
morbidity 
but 
with 
the 
same 
long-term 
effects

on 
snoring 
and 
other 
symptoms 
of 
obstruction 
as 
traditional 
blunt 
dissection 
of 
the 
tonsils. 
The 
primary 
results 
concerning 
pain 
and 
bleeding 
[8] 
are 
in 
accordance 
with 
later 
findings 
by 
Koltai 
et 
al. 
[11] 
who 
used 
a 
microdebrider 
as 
their 
means 
to 
reduce 
the 
size 
of 
the 
tonsils. 
A 
recent 
study 
by 
Hultcrantz 
and 
Ericsson 
[12], 
in 
which 
the 
tonsillotomy 
was 
performed 
with 
monopolar 
RF 
(Surgitrone1, 
Ellman 
Int.), 
also 
demonstrates 
lower 
morbidity 
after 
tonsillotomy. 
The 
basis 
for 
the 
similarities 
must 
be 
that 
a 
partial 
reduction 
of 
the 
tonsil 
leaves 
a 
cushion 
of 
tonsillar 
tissue 
that 
protects 
the 
deep 
capsule 
of 
the 
tonsil 
and 
does 
not 
create 
an 
inflammation 
of 
the 
tonsillar 
pillars. 
The 
tonsillar 
tissue 
per 
se 
seems 
to 
be 
less 
pain 
sensitive 
and 
to 
heal 
faster 
than 
the 
tonsil 
niche 
when 
the 
whole 
tonsil 
is 
removed. 
The 
same 
situation 
is 
probably 
true 
for 
the 
Guillotine 
method, 
that 
is 
still 
practiced 
at 
some 
places 
[13]. 
No 
risk 
has 
been 
shown 
for 
scar 
tissue 
formation 
in 
a 
partially 
operated 
tonsil. 
One 
of 
the 
few 
cases 
where 
TE 
has 
been 
performed 
after 
re-growth 
of 
the 
tonsil 
(outside 
the 
study) 
showed 
a 
quite 
normal 
histological 
picture 
of 
the 
tonsil 
two 
years 
after 
TT 
(Fig. 
7). 


Both 
the 
CO2-laser 
and 
RF 
techniques 
reduce 
the 
post-operative 
period 
by 
approximately 
three 
days 
when 
tonsillotomy 
is 
performed 
instead 
of 
tonsil-

lectomy 
[8,12]. 
Every 
single 
day 
that 
can 
be 
reduced 
of 
the 
post-operative 
period 
is 
important 
in 
cultures 
where 
both 
parents 
work 
outside 
home. 
There 
is 
not 
only 
the 
humane 
incentive 
to 
reduce 
the 
child’s 
suffering, 
but 
also 
an 
economical 
aspect: 
to 
reduce 
the 
number 
of 
days 
a 
parent 
has 
to 
stay 
home 
from 
work 
to 
take 
care 
of 
the 
sick 
child. 


Two-thirds 
of 
the 
children 
studied 
remained 
free 
from 
snoring 
after 
six 
years 
and 
those 
relapsing 
snored 
less 
frequently 
and 
less 
loudly 
compared 
with 
their 
preoperative 
condition 
(Fig. 
2a 
and 
b). 
The 
present 
evaluation 
of 
snoring 
is 
based 
solely 
on 
questionnaires 
answered 
by 
parents. 
No 
clinical 
examinations 
or 
sleep 
studies 
have 
been 
performed 
at 
present. 
The 
first 
decision 
about 
surgery 
was 
made 
without 
sleep 
registration 
after 
a 
clinical 
evaluation, 
so 
we 
found 
no 
reason 
to 
do 
sleep 
studies 
as 
part 
of 
the 
follow-up. 
However, 
all 
children 
who 
currently 
have 
reported 
apneas 
will 
be 
clinically 
examined 
and 
further 
evaluated. 


There 
may 
be 
cases 
of 
asymptomatic 
re-growth 
of 
the 
tonsils, 
but 
the 
true 
measure 
of 
success 
of 
the 
primary 
surgery 
is 
the 
effect 
on 
the 
child’s 
obstructive 
symptoms. 
At 
the 
one-year 
follow-up, 
the 
two 
children 
who 
reported 
snoring 
after 
TT 
were 
examined. 
One 
had 
re-growth 
of 
tonsillar 
tissue 
and 
the

other 
had 
increased 
very 
much 
in 
weight, 
but 
had 
small 
tonsils 
[8]. 


It 
is 
interesting 
that 
some 
of 
the 
tonsillectomized 
children 
had 
started 
to 
snore 
again 
after 
six 
years, 
to 
about 
the 
same 
extent 
as 
the 
tonsillotomized 
children, 
something 
rarely 
commented 
on 
earlier 
in 
the 
literature 
[14]. 
Just 
as 
with 
adults, 
where 
many 
patients 
relapse 
to 
snoring 
some 
years 
after 
surgery 
[15], 
there 
must 
be 
other 
causes 
for 
snoring 
in 
children 
than 
simply 
too 
big 
tonsils 
and 
adenoids. 


Although 
twice 
as 
many 
children 
in 
the 
TT 
group 
had 
started 
to 
snore 
compared 
to 
the 
TE 
group, 
the 
clinical 
significance 
of 
this 
recurrence 
was 
not 
such 
that 
the 
parents 
had 
regarded 
the 
snoring 
as 
a 
medical 
problem. 
Further 
research, 
concerning 
the 
recurrence 
of 
snoring 
after 
surgery, 
is 
ongoing 
with 
the 
hypothesis 
that 
the 
children 
who 
start 
to 
snore 
again 
might 
not 
have 
achieved 
the 
ability 
to 
breathe 
through 
their 
nose 
after 
the 
tonsil/adenoid 
surgery. 


We 
have 
previously 
pointed 
out 
advantages 
of 
tonsillotomy 
in 
the 
short 
term. 
Is 
there 
a 
trade-off 
such 
that 
these 
advantages 
are 
gained 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
the 
long-term 
effects? 
In 
the 
present 
study, 
we 
found 
that 
the 
fundamental 
long-term 
results 
of 
both 
kinds 
of 
operations 
were 
compatible. 
No 
family 
had 
seen 
a 
need 
to 
seek 
medical 
advice 
for 
recurring 
problems. 
The 
assessments 
of 
general 
health 
and 
patient 
satisfaction 
were 
evenly 
distributed. 


Snoring 
as 
a 
symptom 
recurred 
in 
8 
out 
of 
19 
children 
in 
the 
tonsillotomy 
group 
versus 
4 
out 
of 
18 
in 
the 
tonsillectomy 
group. 
Statistically, 
this 
may 
or 
may 
not 
be 
a 
spurious 
difference. 
The 
magnitude 
of 



E. 
Hultcrantz 
et 
al. 
the 
recurrent 
snoring 
was 
less 
than 
that 
of 
the 
preoperative 
snoring, 
and 
against 
the 
background 
of 
the 
other 
questions, 
the 
snoring 
was 
not 
found 
to 
affect 
the 
children’s 
overall 
health. 
This 
goes 
for 
both 
kinds 
of 
operations. 
Thus, 
with 
the 
most 
conservative 
interpretation 
of 
the 
data, 
we 
may 
advise 
families 
that 
there 
may 
be 
a 
somewhat 
greater 
risk 
of 
hearing 
the 
child 
snore 
again 
years 
after 
a 
tonsillotomy, 
but 
that 
it 
is 
unlikely 
to 
be 
severe 
enough 
to 
disrupt 
sleep. 
We 
know 
from 
clinical 
experience 
that 
occasional 
failures 
occur 
after 
both 
techniques, 
although 
none 
were 
found 
in 
the 
present 
study. 


In 
the 
small 
children, 
entering 
this 
study, 
snoring 
was 
commonly 
associated 
with 
eating 
problems. 
In 
the 
cases 
where 
snoring 
recurred 
later 
on, 
it 
was 
never 
accompanied 
by 
eating 
difficulties. 
Either 
the 
regrowth 
of 
tonsils 
was 
less 
severe 
than 
before, 
or 
the 
follow-up 
time 
of 
this 
study 
covered 
a 
period 
of 
rapid 
bodily 
growth 
during 
which 
the 
lymphatic 
tissue 
of 
the 
Waldeyers’s 
ring 
did 
not 
grow 
as 
much 
as 
the 
diameter 
of 
the 
pharynx. 


When 
children 
grow 
up, 
they 
tend 
to 
sleep 
more 
often 
in 
a 
room 
of 
their 
own 
and 
to 
go 
to 
sleep 
later, 
thus 
reducing 
the 
parents’ chances 
of 
observing 
sleeping 
behavior 
and 
apneas. 
Most 
parents 
in 
the 
present 
study 
still 
were 
of 
the 
firm 
opinion 
that 
there 
was 
a 
considerable 
lasting 
improvement 
in 
their 
child’s 
tendency 
toward 
apneas, 
regardless 
of 
the 
surgical 
technique 
used. 


Tonsillar 
surgery 
is 
performed 
for 
obstructive 
problems 
or 
recurrent 
infections 
or 
both. 
Only 
children 
with 
predominantly 
obstructive 
problems 
were 
recruited 
to 
the 
present 
study. 
Even 
though 
infection 
prone 
children 
were 
excluded, 
it 
is 
of 
interest 
to 
note 
that 
the 
risk 
for 
URI’s 
requiring 
antibiotics 
in 
this 
group 
during 
the 
six 
years 
following 
surgery 
was 
the 
same 
whether 
all 
tonsil 
tissue 
was 
removed 
or 
not. 
The 
same 
number 
of 
‘‘throat 
infections’’ was 
treated 
with 
antibiotics 
in 
both 
groups. 
That 
is, 
in 
accordance 
with 
a 
20-year 
follow-up 
after 
tonsillectomy 
due 
to 
obstruction, 
where 
no 
difference 
in 
URI’s 
could 
be 
seen 
in 
comparison 
to 
people 
of 
the 
same 
age 
who 
had 
not 
been 
tonsillectomized 
[14]. 
Children 
randomized 
to 
conservative 
treatment 
or 
tonsillectomies 
due 
to 
recurrent 
tonsillitis 
have 
also 
been 
shown 
to 
have 
an 
equal 
number 
of 
throat 
infections 
two 
years 
after 
surgery 
[16]. 
In 
the 
RF-
study, 
already 
mentioned 
[12], 
children 
with 
recurrent 
tonsillitis 
were 
not 
excluded 
and 
most 
of 
these 
children 
benefited 
from 
the 
tonsillotomy 
as 
well 
[17]. 
Our 
results 
tend 
to 
support 
the 
suggestion 
that 
tonsillotomy 
with 
CO2-laser 
could 
be 
appropriate 
for 
use 
on 
some 
children 
with 
recurrent 
tonsillitis. 


According 
to 
an 
ongoing 
national 
quality 
assurance 
study 
in 
Sweden 
(unpublished 
data), 
patient 
satisfaction 
with 
tonsil 
surgery 
is 
extremely 
high 


(97% 
out 
of 
17,843 
patients 
in 
the 
database). 
The 
present 
study 
confirms 
this 
observation 
in 
a 
smaller 
groupofoperatedchildrenoveraprolongedfollow-
up 
period, 
showing 
an 
equally 
high 
satisfaction 
among 
those 
operated 
with 
tonsillotomy. 
A 
good 
appreciation 
of 
the 
effects 
of 
the 
surgery 
is 
also 
given 
by 
the 
high 
percentage 
rating 
in 
both 
groups 
of 
their 
children’s 
overall 
health 
as 
substantially 
improved 
six 
years 
after 
surgery. 
The 
concept 
of 
‘‘better 
health’’ is 
difficult 
to 
verbally 
define, 
but 
might 
well 
include 
recovery 
from 
minimal 
neurocognitive 
deficits, 
which 
have 
been 
meas– 
ured 
in 
children 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
[18,19]. 
All 
ENT 
surgeons 
have 
heard 
parents 
express 
that 
they 
‘‘have 
got 
a 
new 
child’’ after 
tonsil 
surgery. 


6. 
Conclusion 
The 
present 
study 
shows 
that 
tonsillotomy 
with 
CO2laser 
is 
a 
reliable 
method 
for 
tonsil 
surgery 
for 
relief 
of 
obstructive 
symptoms 
persisting 
after 
six 
years. 
The 
long-term 
results 
are 
the 
same 
as 
for 
conventional 
tonsillectomy, 
but 
with 
the 
use 
of 
much 
less 
aggressive 
surgery 
and 
with 
decreased 
post-operative 
morbidity.
