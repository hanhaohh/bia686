Objective: 
To 
validate 
a 
disease-specific 
health-
related 
quality 
of 
life 
(HRQOL) 
instrument 
for 
children 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
disorders 
(OSDs). 


Design: 
Prospective 
cohort 
study 
using 
a 
6-item 
health-
related 
instrument 
(OSD-6). 


Subjects: 
One 
hundred 
caregivers 
of 
patients 
with 
OSDs 
secondary 
to 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy 
(age 
range, 
2-12 
years) 
from 
2 
tertiary 
care, 
pediatric 
otolaryngology 
practices. 


Intervention: 
The 
OSD-6 
was 
administered 
on 
initial 
presentation 
and 
4 
to 
5 
weeks 
after 
adenotonsillectomy. 
A 
subset 
of 
patients 
repeated 
the 
OSD-6 
within 
3 
weeks 
after 
presentation 
to 
assess 
test-retest 
reliability. 


Main 
Outcome 
Measures: 
Test-retest 
reliability, 
internal 
consistency, 
construct 
validity, 
and 
responsiveness 
to 
clinical 
change 
of 
the 
OSD-6 
score. 


Results: 
Test-retest 
reliability 
was 
good 
(intraclass 
cor


relation 
coefficient=0.74). 
Median 
OSD-6 
score 
was 
4.5 
(0-to 
6-point 
scale) 
with 
higher 
scores 
indicating 
poorer 
quality 
of 
life 
(QOL). 
Construct 
validity 
was 
demonstrated 
by 
the 
moderate 
correlation 
between 
OSD-6 
score 
and 
global 
adenoid 
and 
tonsil-related 
QOL 
(R 
= 
-0.62), 
strong 
correlation 
between 
the 
OSD-6 
change 
score 
and 
change 
in 
global 
adenoid 
and 
tonsil-
related 
QOL 
(R=-0.63), 
and 
the 
moderate 
correlation 
between 
the 
change 
score 
and 
parent 
estimate 
of 
clinical 
change 
(R=0.40). 
The 
mean 
change 
in 
OSD-6 
score 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
was 
3.0 
(95% 
confidence 
interval, 
2.7-3.4). 
The 
mean 
standardized 
response 
was 


2.3 
(95% 
confidence 
interval, 
1.9-2.7) 
indicating 
the 
instrument’s 
large 
responsiveness 
to 
clinical 
change. 
The 
change 
score 
was 
very 
reliable 
(R=0.85). 
Conclusions: 
The 
OSD-6 
is 
a 
reliable, 
responsive, 
easily 
administered 
instrument. 
It 
is 
valid 
for 
detecting 
change 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
in 
children 
with 
OSDs.

HE 
TERM 
“obstructive 
sleep 
disorders” 
(OSDs) 
refers 
to 
the 
spectrum 
of 
sleep-
disordered 
breathing 
that 
is 
severe 
enough 
to 
cause 
clinical 
symptoms. 
This 
includes 
children 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
and 
children 
with 
upper-airway 
resistance 
syndrome 
in 
which 
the 
respiratory 
distress 
index 
is 
often 
normal 
on 
standard 
polysomnographic 
testing. 
Obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
is 
estimated 
to 
occur 
in 
1% 
to 
3% 
of 
pre–school-aged 
children.1-3 
The 
incidence 
of 
upper-airway 
resistance 
syndrome 
is 
unknown, 
but 
it 
is 
likely 
more 
prevalent 
than 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea. 
The 
leading 
cause 
of 
OSDs 
in 
children 
is 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy.3,4 


Treatment 
studies 
of 
OSDs 
in 
children 
have 
mainly 
relied 
on 
objective 
measures 
of 
effectiveness. 
However, 
these 
measures 
may 
be 
less 
relevant 
to 
the 
general 


public. 
Parents 
want 
their 
child 
to 
feel 
and 
function 
better 
and 
third-party 
payers 
want 
objective 
evidence 
that 
surgical 
interventions 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
life 
(QOL) 
in 
general 
and 
health-related 
quality 
of 
life 
(HRQOL) 
more 
specifically. 
In 
the 
context 
of 
OSDs, 
HRQOL 
describes 
the 
net 
consequences 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
on 
the 
child’s 
daily 
activities, 
physical 
symptoms, 
social 
interactions, 
and 
emotional 
well-being. 


Adenotonsillectomy 
is 
the 
most 
common 
treatment 
for 
OSDs 
in 
children 
and 
it 
is 
successful 
in 
alleviating 
the 
problem 
in 
most 
cases. 
However, 
no 
systematic 
outcome 
data 
exist 
concerning 
the 
effect 
of 
this 
procedure 
on 
a 
child’s 
QOL. 
In 
the 
absence 
of 
meaningful 
effectiveness 
data, 
the 
improvement 
in 
QOL 
for 
these 
children 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
is 
unappreciated 
and 
skepticism 
regarding 
the 
benefits 
of 
this 
procedure 
continues.

SUBJECTS, 
MATERIALS, 
AND 
METHODS 


The 
study 
protocol 
received 
approval 
of 
the 
Children’s 
Hospital 
and 
Regional 
Medical 
Center 
Institutional 
Review 
Board, 
Seattle, 
Wash, 
and 
was 
exempted 
from

SURVEY 
DEVELOPMENT 


The 
Obstructive 
Sleep 
Disorders-6 
survey 
(OSD-6) 
was 
modeled 
in 
a 
format 
analogous 
to 
the 
a 
6-item 
health-related 
instrument 
for 
otitis 
media-6, 
a 
validated 
survey 
for 
assessing 
HRQOL 
in 
acute 
and 
chronic 
otitis 
media.5 
The 
OSD-6 
was 
composed 
of 
6 
domains, 
which 
reflected 
functioning 
of 
the 
child 
regarding 
the 
following: 
(1) 
physical 
suffering, 
(2) 
sleep 
disturbance, 
(3) 
speech 
and 
swallowing 
difficulties, 
(4) 
emotional 
distress, 
(5) 
activity 
limitations, 
and 
(6) 
level 
of 
concern 
of 
the 
caregiver 
relating 
to 
the 
patient’s 
OSD 
and 
associated 
symptoms. 
Each 
domain 
was 
represented 
by 
a 
question 
designed 
to 
reflect 
the 
global 
effect 
of 
an 
OSD-related 
symptom 
cluster 
for 
an 
individual 
child. 
The 
symptom 
clusters 
were 
created 
by 
assimilating 
information 
from 
literature 
review, 
opinions 
of 
pediatric 
otolaryngologists 
and 
pediatric 
otolaryngology 
nurse 
practitioners, 
and 
consultations 
with 
parents 
of 
affected 
children. 
In 
addition, 
the 
questionnaire 
included 
an 
open-ended 
response 
question 
to 
survey 
the 
subjects 
for 
pertinent 
items 
that 
might 
have 
been 
missed 
on 
our 
initial 
survey. 
Individual 
items 
on 
the 
survey 
were 
equally 
weighted. 
The 
mean 
survey 
score 
was 
calculated 
by 
summing 
the 
individual 
domain 
scores 
(domain 
score 
range, 
0-6 
with 
0 
indicating 
“no 
problem” 
and 
6, 
“[it] 
couldn’t 
be 
worse”) 
and 
then 
dividing 
by 
6, 
the 
total 
number 
of 
domains. 
A 
lower 
survey 
score 
indicated 
a 
better 
QOL. 


SUBJECTS 


Eligible 
subjects 
were 
a 
convenience 
sample 
of 
caregivers 
of 
patients 
between 
the 
ages 
of 
2 
and 
12 
years 
undergoing 


adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSDs. 
Subjects 
were 
required 
to 
be 
English 
speaking 
to 
avoid 
semantic 
issues 
in 
interpretation 
of 
the 
domains 
and 
symptom 
clusters.6 
Caregivers 
were 
excluded 
if 
their 
child 
had 
other 
adenotonsillar 
pathology, 
or 
if 
another 
procedure 
was 
to 
be 
performed 
on 
the 
same 
day. 
Demographic 
data 
(ie, 
age 
and 
sex) 
and 
tonsillar 
size 
were 
recorded 
for 
all 
patients, 
including 
patients 
whose 
caregiver 
refused 
enrollment 
or 
those 
who 
dropped 
out 
of 
the 
study. 
Children 
were 
diagnosed 
as 
having 
OSDs 
based 
on 
a 
combination 
of 
any 
of 
the 
following 
modalities 
as 
determined 
by 
the 
standard 
clinical 
practice 
of 
the 
attending 
physician: 
medical 
history, 
physical 
examination 
findings, 
x-ray 
film 
of 
the 
lateral 
aspect 
of 
the 
neck, 
nasopharyngoscopy, 
sleep 
videotape, 
and/or 
polysomnographic 
study. 
The 
diagnosis 
was 
determined 
by 
the 
attending 
physicians 
from 
pediatric 
otolaryngology 
clinics 
at 
Children’s 
Hospital 
and 
Regional 
Medical 
Center, 
Seattle, 
Wash, 
and 
Children’s 
Hospital 
of 
the 
King’s 
Daughter, 
Eastern 
Virginia 
Medical 
School, 
Norfolk. 


DATA 
COLLECTION 


The 
OSD-6 
was 
given 
to 
the 
patient’s 
caregiver 
at 
the 
time 
of 
diagnosis. 
Caregivers 
rated 
the 
domains 
on 
a 
0-to 
6-point 
scale 
(no 
problem 
to 
[it] 
couldn’t 
be 
worse) 
based 
on 
how 
they 
felt 
the 
symptoms 
affected 
their 
child 
(Figure 
1). 
In 
a 
subset 
of 
patients, 
a 
second 
survey 
was 
mailed 
to 
the 
caregiver 
5 
days 
after 
the 
first 
visit 
to 
measure 
test-retest 
reliability. 
If 
the 
mailed 
survey 
was 
not 
returned 
prior 
to 
surgery, 
a 
second 
survey 
was 
completed 
by 
the 
caregiver 
on 
the 
day 
of 
surgery 
if 
this 
date 
was 
within 
3 
weeks 
of 
the 
initial 
administration 
of 
the 
survey. 
The 
first 
and 
second 
survey 
had 
to 
be 
completed 
by 
the 
same 
person; 
otherwise 
these 
measurements 
were 
excluded 
from 
test-retest 
calculations. 


In 
patients 
who 
underwent 
adenotonsillectomy 
and 
returned 
for 
the 
postoperative 
visit, 
the 
survey 
was 
re-
administered 
4 
to 
5 
weeks 
after 
surgery, 
so 
that 
the 
potential 
for 
sampling 
any 
symptoms 
of 
the 
recovery 
period 
would 
be 
bypassed. 
The 
caregiver 
was 
additionally 
asked 
to 
rate 
the 
degree 
of 
clinical 
change 
experienced 
by 
their 
child 
on 
a 
-7 
to 
7 
rating 
scale 
(with 
-7 
indicating 
the 
child 
was 
much 
worse; 
7, 
the 
child 
was 
much 
better). 
At 
all 
3 
time 
points 


pose 
of 
this 
study 
was 
to 
design 
an 
instrument 
that 
would 
reflect 
important 
areas 
of 
function 
for 
children 
with 
OSDs 
and 
their 
caregivers, 
which 
could 
be 
completed 
by 
the 
child’s 
caregiver 
during 
a 
routine 
office 
visit. 
The 
instrument 
should 
be 
valid, 
ie, 
actually 
measure 
QOL 
in 
OSDs, 
be 
reproducible 
in 
stable 
subjects, 
and 
be 
responsive 
to 
important 
changes 
in 
patient 
status, 
even 
if 
the 
degree 
of 
change 
was 
small. 
By 
developing 
a 
meaningful 
instrument, 
we 
hoped 
to 
facilitate 
a 
larger 
outcome 
study 
of 
the 
effect 
of 
adenotonsillectomy 
on 
QOL 
for 
children 
with 
OSDs. 


RESULTS
One 
hundred 
caregivers 
of 
children 
with 
OSDs 
meeting 
the 
eligibility 
criteria 
were 
enrolled 
in 
the 
study. 
Sampling 
bias 
was 
assessed 
to 
ensure 
the 
enrolled 
population 
was 
representative 
of 
those 
eligible. 
Demographic 
data 
from 
subjects 
who 
refused 
to 
participate 
and 
study 
enrollees 
who 
dropped 
(n=11) 
were 
compared 
with 
the 


enrolled 
population 
and 
were 
found 
to 
be 
comparable. 
Demographic 
data, 
physical 
examination 
findings, 
and 
mean 
survey 
and 
the 
6 
domain 
scores 
were 
also 
compared 
by 
site 
(Seattle 
vs 
Norfolk) 
and 
were 
not 
significantly 
different. 
The 
median 
patient 
age 
was 
6.2 
years 
(age 
range, 
2.1-12.9 
years). 
49% 
of 
the 
patients 
were 
female 
and 
51% 
were 
male. 
In 
48 
(49%) 
of 
97 
patients 
diagnosis 
was 
based 
on 
medical 
history 
and 
physical 
examination 
findings 
alone; 
an 
additional 
diagnostic 
test 
was 
used 
in 
the 
remainder 
of 
these 
patients. 
Nasopharyngoscopy 
was 
performed 
in 
3 
patients 
(3.1%); 
x-ray 
films 
of 
the 
lateral 
aspect 
of 
the 
neck 
were 
obtained 
for 
13 
patients 
(13.4%). 
Sleep 
videotapes 
were 
obtained 
for 
30 
patients 
(30.9%); 
data 
from 
these 
videotapes 
were 
not 
objectively 
rated. 
Sleep 
studies 
were 
obtained 
for 
6 
patients 
(6.2%). 


All 
caregivers 
were 
able 
to 
easily 
self-administer 
the 
questionnaire 
in 
several 
minutes 
after 
a 
brief 
explanation 
of 
its 
contents.

The

was 
assessed 
using 
data 
from 
all 
surgical 
patients 
in 
whom

(n=62) 
and 
12

than 
3-week 
intervals, 
but 
did 
not 
undergo 
the 
procedure 
in 
the 
study 
period 
(Table

Fifty-five 
patients 
(74.3%) 
demonstrated 
a 
large 
degree 
of 
clinical 
change 
(change 
score 


$1.5), 
1 
patient 
had 
a 
moderate

6 
patients 
(10.8%) 
had 
a 
small

and 
12 
patients 
(16.2%) 
had 
a

Children 
who 
had 
a

on

visit 
had 
a 
mean

whereas 
children 
who 
had 
a

change 
in 
status 
had 
a 
mean 
change 
score 
of 
3.3 
(95%

The

COMMENT
Clinicians 
and 
others 
involved 
in 
decisions 
about 
health 
care 
may 
place 
different 
values 
on 
various 
health 
states 
than 
those 
who 
live 
with 
a 
condition.10 
As 
decisions 
concerning 
resource 
allocation 
become 
increasingly 
stringent, 
it 
is 
important 
to 
understand 
the 
personal 
impact 
of 
diseases 
and 
their 
treatments 
beyond 
the 
standard 
medical 
morbidity 
or 
functional 
limitations 
so 
that 
this 
can 
be 
incorporated 
into 
the 
decision-making 
process. 
In 
the 
context 
of 
this 
study, 
it 
will 
be 
useful 
to 
use 
the 
OSD-6 
to 
measure 
QOL 
changes 
in 
children 
who 
undergo 
adenotonsillectomy. 
We 
can 
then 
share 
this 
information 
with 
parents 
who 
are 
considering 
the 
procedure 
for 
their 
child 
as 
well 
as 
to 
demonstrate 
to 
third-party 
payers 
that 
this 
is 
a 
beneficial 
procedure 
for 
children 
with 
OSDs. 


Measuring 
HRQOL 
involves 
the 
use 
of 
a 
self-
administered 
survey 
or 
instrument, 
which 
contains 
questions 
that 
reflect 
important 
domains 
of 
function. 
The 
instrument 
must 
be 
valid, 
reliable, 
and 
responsive. 
It 
should 
make 
sense 
and 
adequately 
cover 
areas 
of 
relevance 
(face 
and

validity), 
measure 
what 
it 
is 
intended 
to 
measure 
(construct 
validity), 
yield 
relatively 
stable 
results 
when 
readministered 
to 
patients 
with 
stable 
disease 
(testretest 
reliability), 
and 
quantify 
clinically 
meaningful 
QOL 
changes 
over 
time 
within 
a 
patient 
(responsiveness). 
A 
disease-specific 
instrument 
focuses 
on 
areas 
of 
function 
that 
pertain 
to 
a 
particular 
disease 
or 
condition. 
It 
is 
used 
to 
describe 
the 
effect 
of 
disease 
on 
individuals 
above 
and 
beyond 
the 
usual 
biomedical 
factors 
used 
to 
assess 
severity 
of 
the 
particular 
disease 
or 
condition. 


Validation

validity 
evaluations 
tend 
to 
be 
rather 
subjective, 
but 
should 
ideally 
include 
systematic

instruments, 
widely 
accepted 
definitions, 
professional 
opinions, 
and 
information 
extracted 
from 
those 
affected 
by

In

it 
is 
important 
to 
have 
a

predictions 
about 
the 
direction 
and 
magnitude 
of

the

and

otherwise 
it

Validity 
is 
then 
strengthened 
or 
weakened 
according 
to 
whether

are 
supported 
or 
refuted. 


This 
survey 
was 
validated 
in 
the 
2-to 
12-year-old 
age 
group. 
Parents 
or 
caregivers 
were 
used 
as 
proxy 
respondents, 
since 
children 
of 
this 
age 
cannot 
reliably 
answer 
questions 
on 
complex 
concepts.10,13-16 
Adolescent 
patients 
were 
excluded 
because 
the 
prevalence 
of 
OSDs 
is 
highest 
in 
younger 
children 
and, 
by 
including 
adolescents, 
issues 
would 
have 
arisen 
concerning 
the 
appropriateness 
of 
proxy 
responses 
for 
this

under

individual 
domains 
allowed 
the 
caregiver 
to 
rate 
age-appropriate 
symptoms 
for 
their 
child. 


The 
OSD-6 
had 
obvious 
face 
and 
content 
validity 
in 
its 
applicability 
to 
OSDs. 
Cross-sectional 
construct 
validity 
of 
the 
OSD-6 
was 
demonstrated 
by 
confirmation 
of 
moderate 
a 
priori 
correlations 
between 
related 
domains 
(Table 
2). 
In 
addition, 
the 
baseline 
survey 
score 
that 
was 
obtained 
on 
the 
initial 
clinic 
visit 
correlated 
well 
with 
the 
global 
QOL

rating 
scale 
and 
moderately 
well 
with 
the 
physician 
estimate 
of 
the 
effect 
of 
the 
sleep 
disturbance 
on 
QOL. 
This 
may 
reflect 
that 
a 
caregiver 
who 
is 
living 
with 
a 
child 
with 
an 
OSD 
may 
be 
more 
acutely 
aware 
of 
the 
effect 
of 
this 
disorder 
on 
the 
child’s

than 
a

to 
appreciate 
in

sponses 
were 
clustered 
in 
the 
midrange 
of 
response 
options, 
since 
it 
was 
unlikely 
that 
the 
physician 
scheduling 
a 
surgical 
procedure 
would 
rate 
the 
patient’s 
problem 
as 
having 
no 
problem 
or 
“hardly 
a 
problem 
at 
all.” 
If 
the 
survey 
were 
administered 
to 
all 
patients 
being 
evaluated 
for 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSDs 
(rather 
than 
those 
who 
were 
actually 
scheduled 
for 
surgery), 
heterogeneity 
of 
the 
physician 
responses 
might 
have 
resulted 
in 
better 
correlation. 


Correlation 
was 
poor 
between 
clinical 
ratings 
of 
the 
degree 
of 
airway 
obstruction 
(tonsillar 
size, 
nasal 
obstruction, 
and 
speech 
quality) 
and 
the 
mean 
survey 
score; 
our 
initial 
assumption 
was 
that 
these 
factors 
would 
correlate 
with 
the 
degree 
of 
sleep 
disturbance 
and, 
therefore, 
the 
effect 
on 
the 
QOL. 
However, 
in 
retrospect, 
the 
clinical 
measures 
we 
used 
were 
likely 
not 
sensitive 
enough 
to 
distinguish 
between 
children 
with 
varying 
degrees 
of 
OSDs. 
For 
example, 
multiple 
factors 
may 
be 
involved 
in 
craniofacial 
morphometrics 
that 
contribute 
to 
a 
propensity 
for 
an 
OSD 
in 
addition 
to 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy. 
We 
did 
not 
have 
other 
external 
measures 
with 
which 
to 
correlate 
the 
survey 
results 
to 
further 
establish 
construct 
validity, 
since 
this 
validation 
was 
carried 
out 
using 
information 
obtained 
in 
routine 
clinical 
practice. 
Sleep 
studies 
were 
not 
obtained 
routinely; 
however, 
another 
recent 
validation 
study 
of 
an 
OSD 
survey 
showed 
only 
modest 
correlation 
with 
respiratory 
distress 
indexes 
obtained 
from 
nap 
studies.20 
Moreover, 
a 
significant 
pro


portion 
of 
children 
with 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
have 
normal 
findings 
on 
sleep 
studies 
21 
and 
nap 
studies 
lack 
sensitivity 
in 
detecting 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
in 
children. 


In 
the 
patients 
who 
underwent 
adenotonsillectomy 
and 
in 
whom 
follow-up 
data 
were 
available, 
longitudinal 
construct 
validity 
was 
demonstrated 
by 
good 
correlation 
of 
the 
change 
in 
the 
mean 
survey 
score 
with 
the 
change 
in 
the 
global 
QOL 
rating 
scale 
and 
by 
moderate 
correlation 
with 
the 
degree 
of 
clinical 
change 
as 
reported 
by 
the 
caregiver. 
The 
small 
number 
(36 
of 
62) 
of 
caregivers 
from 
whom 
this 
response 
was 
elicited 
may 
have 
affected 
the 
latter 
correlation. 
Again, 
correlation 
was 
poor 
with 
the 
physician 
estimate 
of 
change 
in 
the 
effect 
of 
the 
sleep 
disturbance 
with 
change 
in 
the 
survey 
score. 


Evidence 
for 
responsiveness 
is 
also 
additional 
evidence 
for 
an 
instrument’s 
validity.22,23 
The 
OSD-6 
demonstrated 
excellent 
responsiveness 
as 
judged 
by 
criteria 
presented 
by 
Liang 
et 
al.9 
However, 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
the 
intervention 
(adenotonsillectomy) 
resulted 
in 
improvement 
which 
is 
greater 
than 
the 
smallest 
clinically 
important 
difference, 
the 
estimate 
of 
the 
responsiveness 
may 
be 
inflated.22,24 


CONCLUSIONS
The 
OSD-6 
has 
been 
shown 
to 
be 
a 
valid, 
reliable, 
and 
responsive 
evaluative 
instrument. 
We 
believe 
we 
are, 
indeed, 
measuring 
the 
changes 
in 
health 
status 
in 
children 
with 
OSDs, 
since 
the 
OSD-6 
has 
obvious 
content 
validity 
for 
symptoms 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing. 
Therefore, 
we 
can 
recommend 
its 
use 
in 
clinical 
trials 
to 
assess 
HRQOL 
changes 
in 
patients 
with 
OSDs 
over 
time, 
whether 
due 
to 
no 
treatment, 
adenotonsillectomy, 
or 
other 
intervention 
that 
would 
alter 
patient 
status. 
However, 
the 
modest 
demonstration 
of 
cross-sectional 
construct 
validity 
may 
argue 
against 
the 
use 
of 
the 
instrument 
to 
distinguish 
among 
patients 
with 
OSD 
with 
varying 
levels 
of 
HRQOL. 
Ongoing 
studies 
will 
hopefully 
provide 
research 
evidence 
for 
the 
instrument’s 
validity 
in 
this 
regard.
