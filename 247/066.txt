Objective: We tested the hypothesis that a 6-week course of a nasal glucocorticoid 
spray would decrease the severity of obstructive sleep apnea in 
children with adenotonsillar hypertrophy. 

Study design: We conducted a randomized, triple-blind, placebo-
controlled, parallel-group trial of nasal fluticasone propionate versus 
placebo in 25 children aged 1 to 10 years with obstructive sleep apnea 
proven on polysomnography. The primary outcome was the change from 
baseline in the frequency of mixed and obstructive apneas and hypopneas. 

Results: Thirteen children received fluticasone, and 12 received placebo. 
The mixed/obstructive apnea/hypopnea index decreased from 10.7 ± 2.6 
(SE) to 5.8 ± 2.2 in the fluticasone group but increased from 10.9 ± 2.3 to 

13.1 ± 3.6 in the placebo group, P = .04. The mixed/obstructive apnea/ 
hypopnea index decreased in 12 of 13 subjects treated with fluticasone 
versus 6 of 12 treated with placebo, P = .03. The frequencies of hemoglobin 
desaturation and respiratory movement/arousals also decreased more in the 
fluticasone group. Changes from baseline in tonsillar size, adenoidal size, 
and symptom score were not significantly different between groups. 
Conclusion: Nasal fluticasone decreased the frequency of mixed and obstructive 
apneas and hypopneas, suggesting that topical corticosteroids may 
be helpful in ameliorating pediatric obstructive sleep apnea. (J Pediatr 

2001;138:838-44) 

In children, obstructive sleep apnea is 
most often associated with adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy. The prevalence of 
pediatric OSA has been estimated at 
1% and occurs most frequently in children 
between 2 and 6 years old, when 
the adenoids and tonsils are largest 

relative to the pharyngeal space.1-3 
Chronic sleep-related airway obstruction 
results in repetitive hypoxemia 
and sleep disturbance that can cause 
neurocognitive disturbance, growth 
failure, and cor pulmonale.4-7 Pediatric 
OSA is usually managed with adeno-

It is generally accepted that corticosteroids 
are not useful in the management 
of pediatric OSA.13 We previously 
determined that a 5-day course of 
systemic prednisone therapy was ineffective 
in reducing the severity of pediatric 
OSA.14 By contrast, Demain and 
Goetz15 showed that topical nasal corticosteroids 
over a 24-week treatment 
reduced adenoidal size and improved 
symptoms of nasal airway obstruction.
15 However, these investigators did 
not study children <5 years old, nor did 
they evaluate the efficacy for OSA. In 
a preliminary open-label pilot study of 
nasal fluticasone in 7 children with 
OSA, with the use of the same protocol 
described for this study, we found a decrease 
in the mixed/obstructive apnea/ 
hypopnea index from 11.3 ± 3.6 to 4.9 ± 

3.2 (P = .06). Six of 7 children had a decrease 
in the mixed/obstructive apnea/ 
hypopnea index after 6 weeks of fluticasone 
treatment.

We therefore designed a randomized, 
triple-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-
group trial to test the hypothesis 
that topical nasal corticosteroids would 
decrease the severity of pediatric OSA.

METHODS 

Study Subjects 

The study was approved by the Institutional 
Review Board of the Montreal 
Children’s Hospital. The study subjects 
were children between 1 and 10 years 
old who were referred from otolaryngologists 
and met the following 3 inclusion 
criteria: (1) adenoidal hypertrophy, 
assessed on radiography as an adenoidal/
nasopharyngeal ratio >0.516,17 or 
2+ or 3+ tonsillar hypertrophy assessed 
on clinical evaluation, (2) signs and 
symptoms of OSA including loud snoring, 
difficulty breathing, OSA witnessed 
by parents, parental concern 
about breathing during sleep, or restless 
sleep,18 and (3) a mixed/obstructive 
apnea/hypopnea index >1 proven by 
laboratory or home polysomnography.
13,19,20 Children were enrolled between 
November 1997 and October 
1999. Informed consent was obtained 
from the parents of each child, and assent 
was obtained from children >6 
years old. 

Children were excluded if they had 
any of the following: craniofacial abnormalities, 
genetic abnormalities including 
Down syndrome, neurologic 
disease, acute upper respiratory infection, 
severe OSA requiring urgent 
surgery, 4+ tonsillar hypertrophy, exposure 
to varicella, or use of any corticosteroids 
or antibiotics within the 
past 3 weeks. 

Study Protocol 

Randomization was performed from 
a table of random numbers. Subjects 
were allocated to treatment groups 
with simple randomization in blocks of 

4. The study drug was dispensed by a 
pharmacist to an investigator, who 
then demonstrated the use of the medication 
to the subjects and parents. 
Parents were contacted weekly by an 
investigator to determine whether the 
study drug was being given and 
whether any complications had occurred. 
Only the study pharmacist was 
aware of the group assignment. Sleep 
laboratory personnel, subjects, parents, 
and physicians were all blinded to 
group assignment until the entire study 
was completed and analyzed. 

Fluticasone propionate (Flonase, 
GlaxoWellcome) and placebo were 
provided in identical containers by the 
drug manufacturer. The appearance 
and smell of the fluticasone and placebo 
were indistinguishable. Each fluticasone 
spray delivered 50 µg of active 
drug. The study drug was given as one 
spray per nostril twice daily for the 
first week and once daily for the subsequent 
5 weeks. These doses were chosen 
because they have been found to 
be safe and effective for children with 
allergic rhinitis.21 A 6-week course of 
treatment was chosen because in our 
hospital, the usual waiting time for 
adenotonsillectomy was 8 to 12 weeks. 
Thus participation in the study would 
not delay institution of standard therapy. 
After the post-study evaluations 
were completed, the parents and otolaryngologist, 
who remained blinded to 
the treatment group, were free to 
choose nasal fluticasone, adenotonsillectomy, 
or conservative follow-up. 

Outcome Measures 

Each subject had a polysomnographic, 
clinical, and radiographic 
assessment at baseline and after 6 
weeks on treatment. The primary 
outcome measure was the change in 
the frequency of mixed and obstructive 
apneas and hypopneas during 
sleep from baseline until after the treatment 
protocol. Secondary outcomes 
included changes in the following measures: 
the frequency of hemoglobin 
desaturations, the frequency of movement/
arousals terminating apneas 
and hypopneas, adenoidal size and 
minimal nasopharyngeal airway size 
measured with radiography, tonsillar 
size measured at clinical evaluation, 
and symptom score as assessed by the 
parents.16-20

Specific Measurement 
Techniques 

POLYSOMNOGRAPHY. Each child underwent 
polysomnography to document 
the severity of OSA and to evaluate 
the response to study drug 
treatment. Whenever possible, studies 
were performed in the child’s home. 
The portable recording system comprised 
cardiorespiratory and video 
recordings and was designed to quantitate 
the essential diagnostic elements 
of OSA: the frequencies (number per 
hour of sleep) of mixed and obstructive 
apneas and hypopneas, hemoglobin 
desaturation (=4%), and movement/ 
arousals terminating apneas and hypopneas; 
sleep versus wakefulness; 
sleep position; and snoring.20,22-25 Obstructive 
apnea was defined as an 80% 
or greater decrease in amplitude on the 
respiratory inductive plethysmography 
summation channel of at least 3 seconds’ 
duration; hypopnea was defined 
as a 50% to 80% decrease in amplitude 
of the summation channel accompanied 
by a decrease in saturation of 4% 

19,20

or more.

In the home, equipment was set up 
by a technician at the child’s usual bedtime 
and was retrieved the next morning. 
The cardiorespiratory recording 
consisted of an electrocardiogram, 
pulse rate, SaO2, pulse waveform, and 
thoracic and abdominal excursions and 
their sum obtained from a respiratory 
inductive plethysmograph. The signals 
were recorded on a portable computer 
and later transferred to a computerized 
polysomnograph in the sleep laboratory. 
Audiovisual recordings were made 
under infrared lighting and provided 
complementary information about 
snoring and the subjects’ movement 
and position. Videotape recordings 
were time-matched to the cardiorespiratory 
recordings and analyzed on a 
computerized movement detection system 
(SleepVision, Martinex, Montreal, 
Quebec).22 

In-laboratory polysomnographic studies 
were performed when the child 
lived far from the hospital or in a home

These studies included the same 
recording channels obtained for home 
polysomnography plus transcutaneous 
and end-tidal CO2, an oronasal thermistor, 
electroencephalograms, electrooculogram, 
and chin elecromyogram.20 
For each child the polysomnography 
setting remained the same before and 
after fluticasone or placebo treatment. 

OTHER MEASUREMENTS. Lateral neck 
radiographs were taken as described 
previously for adenotonsillar hypertrophy 
measurement in children with 
OSA syndrome.3,16 The study radiologist 
(K.O.), blinded to treatment assignment, 
interpreted the radiographs 
and made measurements of the adenoidal/
nasopharyngeal ratio and the diameter 
(in millimeters) of the nasopharyngeal 
airway at its narrowest point.16 

An otolaryngologist blinded to treatment 
assignment performed a physical 
examination. Tonsillar size was graded 
from 0 to 4+.17 The grading was based 

on the proportion of the distance between 
the anterior tonsillar pillars that 
was taken up by the tonsillar tissue: 0, 
tonsils not extending beyond the pillars; 
1+, 0% to 25%; 2+, 25% to 50%; 
3+, 50% to 75%; and 4+, 75% to 100%. 

An interviewer administered a questionnaire 
based on an earlier study18; 
the questionnaire asks a battery of 
questions relating to signs and symptoms 
of OSA and other general health 
questions. A symptom score (“OSA 
score”; range, –3.83 to 3.97) derived 
from parental responses to questions 
about snoring, difficulty breathing, 
and obstructive apnea was calculated 
and used to assess the clinical response 
to study drug treatment. 

Statistics 

Results were expressed as the mean 
± SEM or as the median, interquartile 
range, as indicated. To assess treatment 
effectiveness, the unpaired t test 
and Fisher’s exact test were used for 
normally distributed and ordinal vari


statistically significant and clinically

in the primary outcome measure and

Therefore the study was terminated, 
and the results are reported here. 

RESULTS 

A total of 278 patients underwent 
polysomnography during the study period. 
A total of 234 were excluded for 
the following reasons: mixed/obstructive 
apnea hypopnea index <1 (74), age 
<1 year old (8), age >10 years old (10), 
myelomeningocele (29), severe OSA 
requiring prompt surgery (10), use of 
steroids (13), bronchopulmonary dysplasia 
and other respiratory disorders 
(11), craniofacial abnormalities (11), 
neuromuscular and neurologic disorders 
(31), other genetic and medical 
disorders (15), use of antibiotics (5), 
tonsillar size 4+ (2), central hypoventilation 
syndrome (5), postadenotonsillectomy

subjects were randomized to fluticasone 
and 12 to placebo. There were 
no significant differences between 
study participants and those who refused 
participation for age, sex, or 
most baseline polysomnographic measures. 
There was a trend toward a 
lower mixed/obstructive apnea/hypopnea 
index in the refusal group than in 
the participant group, 6.3 ± 1.2 versus 

10.8 ± 1.7 events per hour, respectively, 
P = .06. 
The baseline characteristics of children 
allocated to the fluticasone and 
placebo groups were similar (Table I). 
Home polysomnography was used for 
12 of 13 subjects in the fluticasone 
group and 10 of 12 subjects in the placebo 
group. Mixed/obstructive apnea/hypopnea 
indexes ranged from 1.9 to 37.0 
events per hour of sleep, and mean values 
for the 2 groups were comparable. 

Compliance with prescribed dosing 
was excellent in both groups, with parents 
reporting that 96% ± 1% and 92% 
± 3% of doses were given in the fluticasone 
and placebo groups, respectively. 
Differences in container weights indicated 
that 116 ± 9 versus 111 ± 10 
sprays were dispensed for the fluticasone 
and placebo groups, respectively; 
the protocol called for 98 sprays per 
subject. The only complication possibly 
related to topical nasal treatment 
was a nosebleed in 1 subject in the 
placebo group. 

Polysomnographic Outcomes 

Changes in polysomnographic, adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy, and clinical 
outcomes are summarized in Table II. 
The mixed/obstructive apnea/hypopnea 
index decreased by 5.0 ± 1.0 events 
per hour in the fluticasone group but 
increased by 2.2 ± 3.3 events per hour 
in the placebo group, P = .04 (Fig 1). 
The mixed/obstructive apnea/hypopnea 
index decreased in 12 of 13 subjects 
in the fluticasone group but in 
only 6 of 12 subjects in the placebo 
group, P = .03. The frequency of hemoglobin 
desaturation decreased more in

group, P = .03 (Fig 2). The frequency 
of movement/arousals terminating

in the fluticasone group than in the

treatment period, 5 of 13 subjects in

in the placebo group received antibiotics 
for otitis media (6) or sinusitis

antibiotic use did not affect 
group differences for the previously

rate, heart rate, lowest hemoglobin 
saturation, percentage of sleep time 
with paradoxical movement of the 
chest and abdomen, and sleep efficiency 
were not statistically significant. 

Other Outcomes 

Differences across groups for radiographic 
and clinical outcomes were 
not statistically significant (Table II). 
Tonsillar size decreased in 62% of subjects 
in the fluticasone group and in 
33% of subjects in the placebo group, 

P = .24. The OSA symptom score decreased 
in 69% of the subjects in the 
fluticasone group and in 50% of the 
placebo group, P = .43. 

Follow-up 

Post-study treatment choices did not 
differ significantly by study group. 
Parents and the otolaryngologist decided 
to proceed to adenotonsillectomy 
after study completion for 46% of the 
subjects in the fluticasone group and 
for 75% of the subjects in the placebo 
group. Open-label treatment with 
nasal fluticasone propionate was chosen 
after study completion by parents 
of 62% and 33% of the fluticasone 
group and placebo group, respectively. 

DISCUSSION 

This study investigated the effect of 
nasal corticosteroids on OSA in children. 
We found that a 6-week course 
of nasal fluticasone decreased the

tically significant reductions in adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy or the symptom 
score. However, parental reports may 
not be a sensitive marker for severity 
of OSA, because several previous 
studies have shown that parents are 
not able to differentiate reliably between 
OSA and simple snoring.26 

THE JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS 
JUNE 2001 

The pathogenesis of OSA is thought 
to involve both anatomic and neuromuscular 
factors that predispose to inspiratory 
collapse of the pharyngeal airway.13 
Marcus13 has shown that pharyngeal 
airway closing pressure is higher in children 
with OSA than in a control group. 
The importance of neuromuscular maintenance 
of upper airway patency is supported 
by animal models and clinical 
studies and by the clustering of obstructive 
events in rapid eye movement sleep, 
when pharyngeal muscular tone decreases.
23,27,28 The importance of the 
anatomic component is supported by the 
generally beneficial response to adenotonsillectomy.
4,5,29 Furthermore, Isono 
et al30 showed that the difference in closing 
pressure of the pharyngeal airway 
between children with and without 
OSA is maintained during anesthesia 
and muscular paralysis. 

Topical nasal steroids most likely affect 
the anatomic component by decreasing 
inspiratory upper airway resistance 
at the nasal, adenoidal, or 
tonsillar levels. McColley et al31 
demonstrated a high prevalence of allergic 
rhinitis in children with OSA. 
However, in patients with rhinitis, 
snoring and other nasal symptoms improved 
in both allergic and nonallergic 
children treated with nasal beclomethasone.
15 Corticosteroids, by 
their lympholytic or anti-inflammatory 
effects, might reduce adenotonsillar hypertrophy. 
Demain and Goetz15 found 
that the adenoidal to choanal ratio, as 
assessed by rhinoscopy, decreased by 
29% over a 24-week treatment course. 
Because our study used a shorter treatment 
duration and assessed the adenoids 
by lateral neck radiographs, it remains 
possible that nasal steroids 
reduced the severity of pediatric OSA 
by diminishing adenoidal tissue. The 
possibility that nasal steroids might reduce 
tonsillar size had not been previously 
tested. Although tonsillar size 
decreased in 62% of subjects in the fluticasone 
group, the sample size in this 
study was too small to demonstrate a 
statistically significant effect.

sillectomy. 
Most of our polysomnography 
studies were performed in a home 
setting without airflow, CO2 measurement, 
or sleep state staging. Because 
our study was a blinded, randomized, 
controlled trial, there is no reason to 
suspect that group differences are due 
to these measurement limitations. Furthermore 
we have shown that our technique 
of home polysomnography 
results in equivalent apnea and desaturation 
indexes and improved sleep efficiency 
compared with conventional 
laboratory polysomnography.20 

Our study was not designed to compare 
nasal corticosteroids with adenotonsillectomy 
or to determine the optimal 
drug, dose, or duration for 
treatment. This study does not prove 
that pediatric OSA can be cured by 
nasal corticosteroid treatment. We 
chose doses of 200 µg/d for the first 
week and 100 µg/d for the next 5 
weeks. In a study using 336 µg/d of 
nasal beclomethasone for 8 weeks followed 
by 168 µg/d for 16 additional 
weeks, both adenoidal size and symptom 
score continued to decrease over 
the 24-week treatment period.15 It 
therefore seems likely that the optimal 
duration of treatment for pediatric 
OSA is longer than the 6-week period 
used in our study. Whether corticosteroid-
induced improvements in OSA 
frequency, adenoidal size, and symptoms 
are maintained after the treatment 
is discontinued is unknown. 

The possibility of managing pediatric 
OSA with topical nasal steroids is an 
attractive one, because this treatment 
has been found safe for children and 
adults with seasonal and perennial 
rhinitis.21,32-34 If topical corticosteroids 
are used for a prolonged peri


od, however, careful monitoring for 
side effects may be necessary. Systemic 
effects on growth, bone metabolism, 
and the adrenocortical axis are potentially 
important problems but seem unlikely 
for three reasons. First, the low 
daily doses needed, 100 to 200 µg/d of 
fluticasone, are below those found to 
have systemic side effects.35,36 Second, 
because the area of nasal mucosa is 
much less than the area of pulmonary 
mucosa, topical nasal corticosteroids 
result in much less systemic absorption 
than when corticosteroids are inhaled 
to manage asthma.37 Less than 2% 
of nasal fluticasone becomes systemically 
available.38 Third, newer topical 
steroids such as fluticasone are poorly 
absorbed after being swallowed and are 
rapidly metabolized in the liver, thereby 
decreasing systemic availability.39 

This trial suggests that topical nasal 
corticosteroids may reduce the severity 
of pediatric OSA. With these positive 
findings, further work will be required 
to replicate the current results, 
to demonstrate the mechanism by 
which topical corticosteroids ameliorate 
obstructive apnea, and to establish 
the place of corticosteroids within the 
therapeutic armamentarium. For children 
with obstruction too mild to justify 
surgery, topical corticosteroid treatment 
may prove to be the treatment of 
choice. For others, as in this protocol, 
nasal corticosteroids may provide 
some relief until adenotonsillectomy 
can be performed. Significant cost savings 
would accrue if it could be shown 
that nasal corticosteroid treatment 
could substitute for many of the 
300,000 adenotonsillectomies performed 
in the United States and Canada 
yearly.40 Long-term follow-up will 
be required to determine whether improvements 
are maintained after nasal 
corticosteroids are discontinued.
