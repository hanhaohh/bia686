Summary. 
A positive correlation of severity of sleep-disordered breathing with morning fasting 
insulin levels, which is independent of obesity, was reported in adults and obese children. We 
hypothesized that both severity of sleep-disordered breathing and relative body mass index predict 
fasting insulin and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index values in nonobese children 
with habitual snoring. One hundred and ten subjects with habitual snoring (median age, 6 years; 
range, 2–13 years) underwent polysomnographyand measurement of morning fasting insulin and 
glucose levels. The HOMA index was calculated. Thirty children had an apnea-hypopnea index 
(AHI) 5 episodes/hr(median, 7.8 episodes/hr;range,5–42.3episodes/hr), and80 subjects had 
an AHI <5 episodes/hr (median, 1.9 episodes/hr; range, 0.2–4.9 episodes/hr). Insulin and HOMA 
index values were similar in children with AHI 5 episodes/hr (median insulin, 4.9 mU/l; range, 
1.66–19.9 mU/l; and median HOMA, 1; range, 0.36–4.95) and in subjectswith AHI <5 episodes/hr 
(median insulin, 5.8 mU/l; range, 0.74–41.1 mU/l; and median HOMA, 1.3; range, 0.13–9.72) 
(P 
> 
0.05). No significant correlations were identified between insulin or HOMA index values and 
any polysomnography indices (P 
> 
0.05). When multiple linear regression was carried out, relative 
body mass index was a significant predictor of log-transformed insulin levels or HOMA index 
values, but AHI and percentage of sleep time with saturation <95% were not. In conclusion, 
contrary to findings in adults and in obese children, severity of sleep-disordered breathing is not a 
significant predictor of fasting insulin or HOMA index values in nonobese children with habitual 
snoring. Pediatr

INTRODUCTION 


Obstructive 
sleep 
apnea-hypopnea 
in 
adults 
is 
related 
to 
an 
increased 
risk 
of 
cardiovascular 
disease.1 
A 
series 
of 
abnormalities 
such 
as 
endothelial 
dysfunction,2,3 
inflammation 
and 
metabolic 
disturbances,4–8 
hypertension,9,10 
and 
changes 
in 
cardiac 
structure 
and 
function2,11 
was 
implicated 
as 
possible 
etiologic 
links 
in 
the 
interaction 
between 
sleep 
apnea 
and 
cardiovascular 
disease. 
Evidence 
has 
accumulated 
indicating 
that 
obstructive 
sleep-
disordered 
breathing 
may 
have 
similar 
adverse 
consequences 
on 
children’s 
cardiovascular 
systems.12–22 
These 
adverse 
effects 
are 
more 
apparent 
in 
those 
children 
who 
have 
moderate 
to 
severe 
disease16,23 
or 
who 
are 


obese.13,24,25 


Obesity 
was 
correlated 
with 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
and 
insulin 
resistance, 
both 
of 
which 
are 
known 
risk 
factors 
for 
cardiovascular 
disease.1,26–29 
Since 
sleep-
disordered 
breathing 
and 
insulin 
resistance 
are 
related 
to 
obesity, 
adequate 
control 
for 
this 
confounder 
is 
necessary 
in 
order 
to 
establish 
an 
independent 
association 
between 
the 
two 
disorders. 
A 
positive 
correlation 
of 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea-hypopnea 
with 
insulin 
resistance, 
independent 
of 
obesity, 
was 
demonstrated 
in 
adults.7,8

insulin 
levels.15 
To 
our 
knowledge, 
studies 
in 
nonobese 
children 
are 
lacking. 
The 
effect 
of 
obstructive 
sleep-
disordered 
breathing 
on 
insulin 
levels 
may 
differ 
in 
obese 
and 
nonobese 
subjects. 
In 
a 
recent 
study, 
higher 
fasting 
insulin 
values 
were 
demonstrated 
in 
obese 
than 
in 
nonobese 
men 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea-hypopnea; 
nonobese 
men 
with 
apnea 
have 
similar 
levels 
to 
those 
of 
nonobese 
controls 
without 
snoring.31 


The 
aim 
of 
the 
present 
investigation 
was 
to 
assess 
the 
association 
of 
severity 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
with 
insulin 
resistance 
in 
nonobese 
children 
with 
habitual 
snoring. 
We 
hypothesized 
that 
fasting 
insulin 
levels 
and 
the 
homeostasis 
model 
assessment 
(HOMA) 
index, 
surrogate 
measures 
of 
insulin 
resistance,30,32 
are 
affected 
significantly 
by 
both 
severity 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
and 
body 
mass 
index. 
To 
test 
this 
hypothesis, 
we 
studied 
nonobese 
children 
with 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
of 
variable 
severity, 
as 
documented 
by 
polysomnography. 


PATIENTS 
AND 
METHODS 


Subjects 


Consecutive 
children 
who 
were 
referred 
to 
the 
Sleep 
Disorders 
Laboratory 
of 
Larissa 
University 
Hospital 
(Larissa, 
Greece) 
were 
recruited 
into 
the 
study 
if 
they 
met 
the 
following 
criteria: 
1) 
snoring 
present 
for 
more 
than 
3 
nights 
per 
week 
(habitual 
snoring); 
2) 
persistence 
of 
snoring 
for 
at 
least 
6 
months; 
and 
3) 
body 
mass 
index 


95th 
percentile 
(adjusted 
for 
age 
and 
gender).33 
Exclusion 
criteria 
were 
the 
following: 
1) 
history 
of 
diabetes 
mellitus 
or 
cardiovascular 
disease; 
2) 
history 
of 
neuromuscular 
or 
genetic 
disorders; 
and 
3) 
use 
of 
corticosteroids 
for 
the 
4 
weeks 
preceding 
study 
recruitment. 
None 
of 
the 
subjects 
of 
the 
present 
investigation 
participated 
in 
other 
research 
projects 
which 
were 
carried 
out 
in 
our 
24,34

center.

Clinical 
Evaluation 


The 
study 
protocol 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
Ethics 
Committee 
of 
Larissa 
University 
Hospital. 
Parental 
informed 
consent 
and 
the 
child’s 
assent 
for 
those 
older 
than 
7 
years 
were 
obtained. 
Parents 
were 
interviewed, 
and 
information 
about 
symptoms 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing, 
past 
medical 
history, 
and 
family 
history 
was 
collected. 
A 
physical 
examination 
was 
performed, 
and 
tonsillar 
size 
was 
graded 
from0–4þ.35 
Tonsillar 
size 
2þ 
was 
defined 
as 
tonsillar 
hypertrophy.36 
Similar 
to 
previous 
studies,13,24 
body 
mass 
index 
was 
estimated 
as 
weight 
in 
kilograms 
divided 
by 
height 
in 
meters 
squared. 
Relative 
body 
mass 
index 
[(absolute 
value/value 
at 
the 
50th 
percentile 
for 
age 
and 
gender) 
. 
100] 
was 
calculated 
using 
standard 
growth 


33 


curves. 


Morning 
blood 
pressure 
was 
measured 
three 
times 
by 
an 
oscillometric 
method 
(Dinamap 
Pro 
100, 
Critikon, 
Tampa, 
FL), 
and 
the 
average 
value 
was 
used 
for 
statistical 
analysis.37 
To 
control 
for 
effects 
of 
age, 
gender, 
and 
height 
on 
systolic 
and 
diastolic 
blood 
pressure, 
a 
blood 
pressure 
index 
was 
calculated 
[(measured 
value 
. 
value 
at 
the 
95th 
percentile) 
. 
100/value 
at 
the 
95th 
percentile],16,19 
based 
on 
normative 
data 
from 
the 
National 
High 
Blood 
Pressure 
Education 
Program.37 


Polysomnography 


Polysomnograms 
were 
performed 
overnight 
in 
the 
Sleep 
Disorders 
Laboratory 
under 
the 
supervision 
of 
a 
trained 
technician. 
The 
Alice 
4 
computerized 
system 
(Healthdyne, 
Marietta, 
GA) 
was 
used, 
and 
the 
following 
parameters 
were 
recorded: 
electroencephalogram 
(C3/A2, 
C4/A1, 
and 
O1/A2); 
right 
and 
left 
oculogram; 
submental 
and 
tibial 
electromyogram; 
body 
position; 
electrocardiogram; 
thoracic 
and 
abdominal 
wall 
motion 
(piezoelectric 
transducers); 
oronasal 
airflow 
(three-pronged 
thermistor); 
and 
oxygen 
saturation 
of 
hemoglobin 
(N-1000 
oximeter, 
Nellcor, 
Van 
Nuys, 
CA). 
Bedtime 
was 
determined 
by 
each 
child’s 
routine, 
and 
polysomnography 
was 
terminated 
upon 
final 
awakening. 


Sleep 
stages 
and 
arousals 
were 
determined 
using 
standard 
criteria.38–40 
Total 
sleep 
time 
was 
measured 
based 
on 
both 
the 
electroencephalogram 
and 
the 
laboratory 
technician’s 
notes. 
Obstructive 
apnea 
was 
defined 
as 
the 
presence 
of 
chest/abdominal 
wall 
motion 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
airflow 
for 
at 
least 
two 
breaths 
in 
duration.41 
Hypopnea 
was 
defined 
as: 
1) 
a 
reduction 
in 
airflow 
signal 
amplitude 
of 
at 
least 
50% 
compared 
to 
baseline; 
2) 
the 
presence 
of 
chest/abdominal 
wall 
motion; 
and 
3) 
oxygen 
desaturation 
of 
hemoglobin 
4% 
or 
with 
an 
arousal.41 
The 
apnea-hypopnea 
index 
(AHI) 
was 
equal 
to 
the 
number 
of 
hypopneas, 
and 
obstructive 
and 
mixed 
apneas 
(apneas 
with 
both 
central 
and 
obstructive 
components), 
per 
hour 
of 
sleep. 
Frequency 
of 
movement/arousals 
terminating 
apneas 
or 
hypopneas 
determined 
the 
respiratory 
movement/arousal 
index. 
The 
number 
of 
episodes 
per 
hour 
of 
oxygen 
desaturation 
of 
hemoglobin 
4% 
(oxygen 
desaturation 
of 
hemoglobin 
index), 
and 
percent 
sleep 
time 
with 
oxygen 
saturation 
of 
hemoglobin 
<95%, 
were 
also 
calculated. 


Laboratory 
Measurements 


Children 
presented 
to 
the 
Sleep 
Disorders 
Laboratory 
by 
8 
PM, 
and 
they 
did 
not 
consume 
any 
food 
or 
beverages 
beyond 
this 
time. 
Venous 
blood 
was 
collected 
between 
8–10 
AM 
from 
all 
subjects 
for 
measurement 
of 
serum 
levels 
of 
insulin, 
glucose, 
total 
cholesterol, 
HDL 
cholesterol, 
and 
triglycerides. 
Serum 
was 
obtained 
immediately 
from 
the 
blood 
sample 
and 
was 
stored 
at 
708C 
until 
assay. 



Snoring 
and 
Insulin 
517 


Insulin 
values 
were 
determined 
with 
an 
electrochemiluminescent 
immunoassay 
in 
a 
Modular 
E170 
analyzer 
(Roche, 
Mannheim, 
Germany). 
Intra-assay 
coefficients 
of 
variation 
were 
5.5% 
at 
14.5 
mU/l, 
5.7% 
at 
51.0 
mU/l, 
and 
4.3% 
at 
143.0 
mU/l. 
Serum 
glucose, 
total 
cholesterol, 
and 
triglyceride 
levels 
were 
measured 
in 
an 
Olympus 
AU 
600 
analyzer 
(Olympus, 
Lismeehan, 
Ireland), 
using 
standard 
enzymatic 
colorimetric 
procedures. 
HDL 
cholesterol 
values 
were 
determined 
by 
an 
enzymatic 
colorimetric 
method 
without 
previous 
precipitation 
of 
other 
lipoproteins. 
The 
HOMA 
index 
was 
calculated 
as 
the 
product 
of 
fasting 
insulin 
(mU/l) 
and 
fasting 
glucose 
concentration 
(mmol/l) 
divided 
by

Data 
Analysis 
and 
Statistics 


Two 
groups 
of 
participants 
were 
formed: 
1) 
subjects 
with 
habitual

and 
AHI 
5 
episodes/hr; 
and 
2) 
subjects 
with 
habitual 
snoring 
and 
AHI 
<5

and 
gender; 
dyslipidemia; 
and 
fasting 
glucose 
6.1 
mmol/l 
or 
110 
mg/dl) 
was 
estimated 
in 
the 
two 
study 
groups.37,42 
Dyslipidemia 
was 
defined 
as 
HDL 
cholesterol 
1.03 
mmol/l 
(40 
mg/dl) 
or 
triglycerides 
1.24 
mmol/l 
(110 
mg/dl).42 
The 
two 
groups 
of 
children 
(AHI 
5 
episodes/hr 
vs. 
AHI 
<5 
episodes/hr) 
were 
compared 
using 
the 
chi-square 
test 
or 
Fisher’s 
exact 
test 
for 
categorical 
characteristics, 
and 
Student’s 
t-test 
for 
normally 
distributed 
or 
the 
Mann-
Whitney 
U-test 
for 
non-normally 
distributed 
continuous 
variables. 
Values 
of 
fasting 
insulin 
and 
HOMA 
index 
were 
log-transformed 
so 
that 
they 
were 
normally 
distributed. 


Spearman’s 
correlation 
was 
applied 
to 
assess 
the 
association 
of 
fasting 
insulin 
or 
HOMA 
index 
values 
with 
relative 
body 
mass 
index 
and 
with 
different 
polysomnography 
indices. 
Multiple 
linear 
regression 
analysis 
was 
carried 
out 
to 
detect 
significant 
predictors 
of 
log 
insulin 
or 
log 
HOMA 
index 
values 
(SPSS 
10.0, 
SPSS, 
Inc., 
Chicago, 
IL). 
Apnea-hypopnea 
index, 
relative 
body 
mass 
index, 
age, 
and 
gender 
were 
entered 
into 
the 
model 
as 
independent 
variables 
(regression 
analysis 
model 
1). 


Since 
the 
mechanism 
of 
insulin 
resistance 
in 
sleep 
apnea 
is 
unknown, 
an 
alternative 
parameter 
of 
severity 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing, 
i.e., 
percentage 
of 
sleep 
time 
with 
oxygen 
saturation 
of 
hemoglobin 
less 
than 
95%, 
was 
also 
used 
(regression 
analysis 
model 
2). 
The 
introduction 
of 
percentage 
of 
sleep 
time 
with 
oxygen 
saturation 
of 
hemoglobin 
<95% 
as 
an 
independent 
variable 
in 
the 
regression 
analysis 
is 
supported 
by 
data 
indicating 
that 
hypoxia 
may 
cause 
glucose 
intolerance 
in 
humans.43 
The 
two-model 
approach 
was 
applied 
in 
previous 
studies.7,44 
Apnea-hypopnea 
index 
and 
percentage 
of 
sleep 
time 
with 
oxygen 
saturation 
of 
hemoglobin 
<95% 
were 
not 
introduced 
in 
the 
same 
regression 
analysis 
model 
because 
they 
were 
positively 
correlated 
(r 
¼ 
0.74, 
P 
< 
0.001). 
Relative 
body 
mass 
index, 
age, 
and 
gender 
were 
other 
independent 
variables 
in 
regression 
analysis 
model 
2.

DISCUSSION 


In 
the 
present 
investigation 
of 
nonobese 
children 
with 
habitual 
snoring, 
relative 
body 
mass 
index 
(but 
not 


severity 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing) 
was 
a 
significant 
predictor 
of 
log-transformed 
fasting 
insulin 
and 
HOMA 
index 
values. 
This 
result 
is 
in 
contrast 
to 
the 
findings 
of 
a 
published 
study 
in 
which 
obese 
children 
with 
snoring 
were 
recruited: 
de 
la 
Eva 
et 
al.15 
demonstrated 
that 
severity 
of 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea-hypopnea 
(but 
not 
body 
mass 
index 
z-score) 
was 
a 
significant 
predictor 
of 
fasting 
insulin 
levels. 
The 
absence 
of 
correlation 
between 
polysomnography 
indices 
and 
insulin 
or 
HOMA 
index 
values 
in 
nonobese 
children 
with 
snoring 
suggests 
that 
obesity 
has 
an 
important 
role 
in 
the 
reported 
association 
between 
severity 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
and 
increased 
insulin 
levels. 


Insulin 
resistance 
is 
defined 
as 
decreased 
responsiveness 
to 
its 
metabolic 
effects. 
It 
is 
related 
to 
obesity, 
hypertension, 
and 
dyslipidemia, 
all 
of 
which 
are 
related 
to

The 
hyperinsulinemic 
euglycemic 
clamp 
is 
the 
standard 
method 
for 
assessing 
insulin 
sensitivity, 
but 
it 
is 
too 
invasive 
for 
a 
child 
and 
is 
technically 
complicated.46,47 
In 
subjects 
without 
diabetes, 
fasting 
insulin 
and 
HOMA 
index 
are 
satisfactory 
surrogate 
measures 
ofinsulin 
resistance,46–48 
and 
they 
were 
used 
for 
this 
purpose 
in 
previous 
studies.7,15 
The 
HOMA 
index 
is 
based 
on 
the 
product 
of 
fasting 
insulin 
and 
glucose 
concentrations, 
which 
are 
obtained 
from 
a 
single 
venous 
blood 
sample. 


In 
de 
la 
Eva 
et 
al.,15 
mean 
(SD) 
morning 
fasting 
insulin 
levels 
in 
62 
obese 
children 
were 
higher 
compared 
to 
values 
in 
the 
present 
investigation: 
154.6 
. 
79.8 
pmol/l 
or 
20.6 
. 
10.6 
mU/l 
vs. 
7.1 
. 
5.7 
mU/l, 
respectively. 
The 
difference 
in 
insulin 
concentrations 
can 
be 
explained 
in 
part 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
participants 
in 
the 
study 
by 
de 
la 
Eva 
et 
al.15 
were 
obese. 
In 
the 
same 
investigation,15 
log-
transformed 
respiratory 
disturbance 
index 
and 
sleep 
time 
with 
saturation 
<90% 
(but 
not 
body 
mass 
index 
z-score) 
were 
significant 
predictors 
of 
insulin 
levels 
in 
obese 
children 
with 
snoring. 
Similar 
to 
the 
findings 
of 
this 
study, 
age 
was 
another 
significant 
predicting 
variable 
of 
insulin 
values. 


When 
comparing 
the 
present 
report 
to 
the 
investigation 
by 
de 
la 
Eva 
et 
al.15 
regarding 
subjects’ 
characteristics, 
female-to-male 
ratio 
and 
severity 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
were 
the 
same. 
In 
our 
study, 
children 
had 
a 
mean 
(SD) 
apnea-hypopnea 
index 
of 
4.7 
. 
6.4 
episodes/hr 
(range, 
0.2–42.3 
episodes/hr), 
and 
in 
the 
series 
by 
de 
la 
Eva 
et 
al.,15 
participants 
had 
a 
mean 
(SD) 
obstructive 
respiratory 
disturbance 
index 
of 
4.1 
. 
11.1 
episodes/hr 
(range, 
0–60.3 
episodes/hr). 
In 
both 
studies, 
more 
male 
than 
female 
subjects 
were 
recruited. 
However, 
children 
of 
the 
present 
investigation 
were 
leaner 
and 
younger 
(mean 
age 
. 
SD, 
6.9 
. 
2.9 
years; 
range, 
2–13, 
vs.

. 
3.2; 
range, 
5–16 
in 
the

by 
de 
la 
Eva 
et 
al.15). 


Data 
in 
recently 
published 
series 
of 
adult 
subjects 
are 
supportive 
of 
an 
association 
between 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
and 
insulin 
resistance 
that 
is 
independent 
of 
adiposity.7,8,44,49 
Recurrent 
episodes 
of 
hypoxia, 
sympathetic 
activation, 
and 
release 
of 
interleukin-6 
and 
tumor 


necrosis 
factor-a 
were 
proposed 
as 
possible 
pathophysiologic 
links 
between 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea-hypopnea 
and 
insulin 
resistance.50,51 
Persistent 
hyperinsulinemia 
is 
not 
a 
benign 
biological 
phenomenon. 
It 
is 
one 
of 
the 
features 
of 
the 
metabolic 
or 
insulin 
resistance 
syndrome 
that 
is 
also 
characterized 
by 
central 
obesity, 
hypertension, 
and 
dyslipidemia, 
all 
of 
which 
are 
independent 
risk 
factors 
for 
cardiovascular 
disease.52 


Obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
in 
adults 
is 
associated 
with 
an 
increased 
risk 
of 
cardiovascular 
morbidity 
and 
mortality.1 
Hypertension,9,10 
changes 
in 
myocardial 
structure 
and 
function,2,11 
endothelial 
dysfunction,2,3,53 
and 
chronic 
inflammation4–6 
related 
to 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
are 
some 
of 
the 
mechanisms 
which 
probably 
contribute 
to 
the 
increased 
frequency 
of 
cardiovascular 
disease 
noted 
in 
sleep 
apnea 
patients. 
Since 
many 
adults 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
have 
features 
of 
metabolic 
syndrome,54 
induction 
of 
insulin 
resistance 
may 
be 
an 
additional 
pathophysiologic 
mechanism 
linking 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
and 
cardiovascular 
disease.1 


Accumulating 
data 
suggest 
that 
similar 
to 
adults, 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea-hypopnea 
in 
children 
is 
associated 
with 
abnormalities 
that 
may 
predispose 
them 
to 
future 
cardiovascular 
morbidity.

of 
insulin 
resistance 
in 
children 
with 
sleep 
apnea 
could 
be 
another 
risk 
factor 
for 
the 
development 
of 
cardiovascular 
disease 
in 
adulthood, 
since 
hyperinsulinemia 
clusters 
with 
features 
of 
metabolic 
syndrome, 
i.e., 
obesity, 
hypertension, 
and 
dyslipidemia.58,59 


The 
absence 
of 
a 
correlation 
between 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
and 
insulin 
or 
HOMA 
index 
values 
in 
nonobese 
children 
with 
habitual 
snoring 
in 
this 
study, 
and 
the 
demonstration 
of 
such 
an 
association 
in 
obese 
subjects,15 
should 
be 
interpreted 
while 
taking 
into 
consideration 
findings 
of 
previous 
relevant 
reports. 
A 
similar 
discrepancy 
regarding 
C-reactive 
protein 
values 
was 
identified 
in 
two 
pediatric 
studies 
of 
habitual 
snorers 
with 
different 



degrees 
of 
adiposity. 
The 
correlation 
between 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea-hypopnea 
and 
C-reactive 
protein13 
disappears 
when 
lean 
children 
are 
studied.24 


As 
suggested 
in 
a 
recent 
editorial, 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea-hypopnea 
may 
have 
different 
effects 
on 
the 
cardiovascular 
system 
of 
children 
with 
obesity 
compared 
to 
lean 
subjects 
with 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy.25 
Obstructive 
sleep 
apnea-hypopnea 
could 
potentially 
unmask 
or 
exacerbate 
the 
detrimental 
effects 
of 
obesity 
via 
various 
mechanisms 
such 
as 
recurrent 
hypoxia 
and 
increased 
sympathetic 
tone.25,60 
This 
speculation 
is 
supported 
by 
an 
additional 
finding 
of 
this 
investigation: 
nonobese 
subjects 
with 
snoring 
and 
an 
AHI 
5 
episodes/ 
hr 
did 
not 
have 
an 
increased 
frequency 
of 
other 
features 
of 
metabolic 
syndrome 
such 
as 
hypertension 
and 
hyperlipidemia. 
However, 
in 
accordance 
with 
other 
pediatric 
studies, 
children 
in 
this 
investigation 
with 
an 
AHI 
5 
episodes/hr 
had 
higher 
systolic 
and 
diastolic 
blood 
pressure 
indices 
than 
subjects 
with 
an 
AHI 
<5 
episodes/hr. 


There 
are 
a 
few 
potential 
limitations 
in 
the 
current 
study. 
First, 
an 
alternative 
explanation 
for 
not 
detecting 
a 
correlation 
between 
severity 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
and 
insulin 
resistance 
should 
be 
considered. 
The 
association 
of 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
with 
insulin 
resistance 
is 
of 
much 
smaller 
magnitude 
compared 
to 
the 
association 
of 
insulin 
resistance 
with 
obesity.7 
Therefore, 
the 
former 
correlation 
may 
not 
be 
apparent 
in 
studies 
with 
relatively 
small 
numbers 
of 
participants 
who 
have 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea-hypopnea 
of 
mild-to-moderate 
severity. 


Second, 
the 
z-score 
is 
a 
more 
acceptable 
method 
for 
expressing 
degree 
of 
adiposity 
than 
relative 
body 
mass 
index 
(BMI).61 
Nevertheless, 
relative 
BMI 
has 
been 
used, 
so 
that 
comparisons 
with 
previous 
studies 
which 
applied 
this 
measure 
of 
adiposity 
are 
possible.13,24 
Third, 
in 
addition 
to 
adiposity, 
age, 
gender, 
race, 
and 
pubertal 
status 
affect 
insulin 
sensitivity.62,63 
Age 
and 
gender 
were 
entered 
as 
independent 
variables 
in 
the 
regression 
analysis 
models 
predicting 
insulin 
resistance, 
and 
all 
children 
were 
of 
Caucasian 
race. 
Although 
a 
few 
subjects 
had 
entered 
puberty, 
a 
maturational 
process 
that 
increases 
insulin 
resistance,63 
Tanner 
stages 
were 
not 
obtained 
during 
clinical 
evaluation 
of 
participants. 


Finally, 
oronasal 
thermistors 
were 
used 
for 
airflow 
measurement 
without 
simultaneous 
end-tidal 
carbon 
dioxide 
recording. 
Even 
though 
it 
was 
recommended 
that 
airflow 
at 
the 
nose 
and 
mouth 
can 
be 
measured 
by 
either 
thermistor 
or 
capnography,41 
the 
thermistor 
signal 
is 
nonquantitative 
and 
may 
underestimate 
episodes 
of 
partial 
airway 
obstruction 
(hypopneas). 


In 
conclusion, 
the 
present 
study 
did 
not 
identify 
an 
association 
between 
severity 
of 
obstructive 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
and 
surrogate 
measures 
of 
insulin 
resistance 
(fasting 
insulin 
levels 
or 
HOMA 
index 
values) 
in 
nonobese 
children. 
The 
results 
of 
this 
investigation 
and 


Snoring 
and 
Insulin 
521 


of 
other 
published 
reports 
on 
insulin 
and 
C-reactive 
protein 
levels 
in 
children 
with 
habitual 
snoring 
lead 
to 
the 
speculation 
that 
obstructive 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
has 
more 
detrimental 
effects 
in 
obese 
than 
in 
nonobese 
young 
subjects.
