Faltering growth may be associated with protein 3 (IGFBP-3) levels before and 
adenotonsillar hypertrophy, but its 6 months after adenotonsillectomy. 
pathophysiological mechanism is unclear. Weight and height standard deviation 
This study included 29 pre-pubertal scores, energy intake per kilogram and 
children with obstructive adenotonsillar serum IGF-1 levels were found to be sighypertrophy, 
and aimed to investigate the nificantly higher 6 months after adenotonprobable 
difference in energy intake and sillectomy, indicating that adenotonsillar 
serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) hypertrophy is associated with poor 
and insulin-like growth factor binding growth.

Introduction 

Chronic upper airway obstruction resulting 
from adenotonsillar hypertrophy (ATH) may 
cause growth retardation in children.1 – 5 
Growth improvement after adenotonsillectomy 
(T&A) has been well reported,6 
but there are few studies in the literature 
investigating levels of insulin-like growth 
factor 1 (IGF-1) and insulin-like growth 
factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) in 
children with ATH before and after T&A.7 – 9 
The aim of this study was to investigate 
growth, energy and protein intake and 
serum IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels 
of children with ATH before and 6 months 
after T&A. 

Patients and methods 

PATIENTS 

Pre-pubertal children (Tanner stage 1) with 
obstructive ATH and healthy children were 
recruited to the study. Informed consent 
was received from the parents prior to 
inclusion of their child into the study. Ethical 
approval was not sought as no invasive 
procedures were used specifically for 
the study. 

CLINICAL ASSESSMENT 

The scale described by Brodsky et al.10 was 
used to categorize tonsillar hypertrophy as 
follows: 0, the tonsils do not impinge 
on the airway; 1+, less than 25%

Adenotonsillectomy and growth 

airway obstruction; 2+, 25 – 50% airway 
obstruction; 3+, 50 – 75% airway obstruction; 
and 4+, 75% airway obstruction. Patients 
with a score of 3+ or 4+ were included and 
adenoid hypertrophy was detected by lateral 
radiography, palpation and endoscopic 
examination. Patients with diseases other 
than obstructive ATH were excluded. 

Weight (kg) and height (cm) of the 
patients were measured and standard 
deviation (SD) scores calculated using 
standard charts.11 Venous blood samples 
were obtained (for measuring IGF-1 and 
IGFBP-3 levels) on entry into the study and at 
6 months after T&A. The blood samples were 
centrifuged and stored at –20 °C until 
measurement of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels. 

Energy and protein intake were calculated 
by a dietician using a 3-day diet record 
completed for the children by the parents 
before and 6 months after T&A. 

BIOCHEMICAL ANALYSES 

Serum IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels were 
determined before and 6 months after T&A 
using the DSL-5600 ACTIVE™ IGF-1 IRMA 

kit and DSL-6600 ACTIVE™ IRMA kit 
(Diagnostic System Laboratories Inc., 
Webster, Texas, USA), respectively. 

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 

Comparisons between groups were assessed 
using the mean ± SD and the Mann– 
Whitney U-test. 

Results 

The mean age of the 29 children in the study 
group was 7.30 ± 2.60 years (range, 
4 – 12 years) and the group comprised 11 
(37.9%) girls and 18 (62.1%) boys. The 
control group comprised 20 children with a 
mean age of 7.0 ± 2.5 years. On physical 
examination all children were in Tanner 
stage 1 (pre-pubertal) both before and 
6 months after T&A.12 

Three patients (10.34%) had height and 
weight SD scores below –2. Mean values of 
weight and height SD scores, intake of 
energy and protein and levels of IGF-1 and 
IGFBP-3 before and after T&A are shown in 
Table 1. All parameters except protein intake

Adenotonsillectomy and growth 

and serum IGFBP-3 levels were statistically 
different before and after T&A. 

Both the weight and height SD scores of 
healthy children were higher than those of 
children with ATH before T&A (P < 0.05 for 
both), but were not different after T&A. 
Similarly, mean energy intake of healthy 
children was higher than that of children 
with ATH before T&A (P < 0.005), but mean 
energy intake of the children with ATH 
increased after T&A. Protein intake was not 
statistically different in healthy children 
when compared with children with ATH 
before and after T&A. 

The mean IGF-1 level of healthy children 
was statistically higher than that of children 
with ATH before T&A (P < 0.05), but was not 
different after T&A. Mean pre- and postoperative 
IGFBP-3 levels did not differ 
between the control and study groups. 

Discussion 

Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome is often 
associated with faltering growth but its 
pathophysiological mechanism is still 
unclear. Anorexia or dysphagia due to ATH, 
abnormal nocturnal growth hormone 
secretion, nocturnal hypoxaemia, nocturnal 
respiratory acidosis and increased caloric 
expenditure due to increased work of 
breathing during sleep are all thought to 
contribute to lack of growth in patients with 

ATH.5,13,14 

The prevalence of growth retardation 
associated with ATH has been reported 
previously as 1 – 46%,2 – 4,9 and consistently, 
we found this value to be 10.34%. Marcus et 
al.13 reported the evaluation of 14 prepubertal 
children with obstructive sleep 
apnoea syndrome for caloric intake, sleeping 
energy expenditure and anthropomorphic 
measurements before and after T&A. They 
found that average sleeping energy 
expenditure decreased and mean weight z 

score increased post-operatively without 
any change in caloric intake. We found a 
significant difference in caloric intake postoperatively 
associated with an increase in 
weight and height SD score, and serum 
IGF-1 level. Bar et al.7 also found an increase 
in weight and IGF-1 level but not in height or 
IGFBP-3 level. These studies, including 
ours, suggest that growth (especially weight 
gain) accelerates after T&A. This finding was 
also reported in children with pre-existing 
obesity.15 Increase in IGF-1 level after T&A 
may also reflect increased energy intake as 
demonstrated in our study. 

In the study of Nieminen et al.,8 weight for 
height, body mass index and IGF-1 and 
IGFBP-3 levels had increased significantly in 
the group that had been surgically treated. 
The significant increase in circulating IGF-1 
concentration after T&A suggests a decrease, 
to near normal levels, in nocturnal growth 
hormone secretion after elimination of the 
obstruction. The level of IGF-1 reflects daily 
mean growth hormone levels, and increase 
in IGF-1 independent from IGFBP-3 may 
indicate an elevation of free IGF-1.7 
Moreover, the correlation between IGF-1 and 
IGFBP-3 is exponential and although the 
regulation of either parameter by various 
factors is qualitatively the same, the 
magnitude of the variation of IGF-1 is 
always much greater than that of IGFBP-3. 
This means that IGF-1 responds more 
sensitively to regulators than IGFBP-3.16 
IGFBP-3 is the major binding protein in the 
circulation and an increase in IGFBP-3 
concentration after T&A in the study of 
Nieminen et al.8 implies decreased growth 
hormone secretion over a significant time 
span prior to treatment. 

The mechanism of disturbed somatotrophic 
axis in children with ATH is 
unknown. Since we found both an increase 
in energy intake and serum IGF-1 levels after 

86

Adenotonsillectomy and growth 

T&A, we think that either low caloric intake 
due to anorexia or dysphagia, growth 
hormone inhibition or both may be 
responsible for faltering growth or growth 

arrest seen in children with ATH. Whatever 
the cause, T&A is a curative way to 
treat children with faltering growth 
caused by ATH.
