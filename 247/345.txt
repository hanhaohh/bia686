BackgroundObesity, apneic hypoxemia, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep are supposed to be the major 
causes for bradyarrhythmia in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. The aims of this study were to compare clinical findings 
and diagnoses in patients with obstructive sleep apnea with and without nocturnal bradyarrhythmia and to analyze the rela- 
tions among hypoxemia, sleep stage, and brodyarrhythmia. 

Methods During a 17-month period 239 patients were found to have sleep apnea in an ambulatory study. Patients with 
nocturnal bradyarrhythmia were hospitalized for 3 days and polysomnographies were performed over 2 successive nights. 
A Holter electrocardiogram was recorded for 48 hours. 

Results Nocturnal episodes of bradyarrhythmia were identified in 17 (7%) of 239 patients. Body mass index (39 _+ 7 vs 
31 + 5 kg/m 2} and respiratory disturbance index (90 + 36 per hour vs 24 _+ 24 per hour) were significantly different (P < 
.01 ) between patients with (n = 17) and without bradyarrhythmia (n = 222). Bradyarrhythmia occurred significantly more 
often during REM than non-REM sleep (P < .01 ). There was a significant difference in end-apneic oxygen saturation in 
apnea/hypopnea episodes with and without bradyarrhythmia (71% _+ 9% vs 75% + 10%; P < .01 ). A linear relation 
between end-apneic oxygen saturation and number of sinus arrests and heart blocks could not be found. 

Conclusions Patients with apnea-associated bradyarrhythmia are more overweight than patients without bradyarrhythmia. 
The higher respiratory disturbance index measurements found in these patients may be caused by this difference. Brady- 
arrhythmia occurs predominantly during REM sleep and occurred independently from decrease in oxygen saturation; a 
threshold value as an upper limit could not be found. (Am Heart J 2000;139:142-8.) 

In approximately 5% to 10% of patients with obstruc- 
tive sleep apnea, nocturnal episodes of bradyarrhythmia 
are found. 1-3 Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, apneic 
hypoxemia, and obesity have been discussed as patho- 
genetic factors.3,4 A desaturation level below 72% has 
been identified by Guilleminault et al3 to be a precondi- 
tion for the occurrence of heart block. Zwillich et al5 
reported that hypoxemia and cessation of respiraUon are 
essenUal in the development of bradycardia in patients 
with apnea. The degree of bradycardia is closely related 
to the severity of hypoxemia but not correlated with 
sleep stage or type of apnea. VagaUy mediated reflex 
mechanisms rather than structural abnormaliUes of sinus 
node and atrioventricular conduction system have been 
proposed by Grimm et al.6 Nasal continuous positive

airway pressure therapy prevents apnea-associated 
bradyarrhythmia in approximately 80% of patients. TM 

This study was performed to compare clinical 
parameters and diagnoses in patients with sleep apnea 
with and without sleep-related bradyarrhythmia. Beyond 
this, the relations among hypoxemia, sleep stage, and 
arrhythmias should be investigated. 

Methods 

Patients 

During a 17-month period 239 patients were found to 
have sleep apnea in an ambulatory study. In addition to the 
clinical interview and physical examination, a visually ana- 
lyzed ambulatory monitoring of breathing sounds, heart rate, 
oxygen saturation, and body position (MESAM IV, Madaus 
Schwarzer, Munich, Germany) from 6 PM until 8 AM and a 2- 
channel Holter electrocardiogram (ECG) (Oxford Medilog 
4000, Abingdon, UK) from approximately 2 PM until 8 AM 
were recorded. 

Patients with nocturnal bradyarrhythmia were hospitalized 
for 3 days and polysomnographies were performed over 2 suc- 
cessive nights. The first night served as an adaptation to the 
measurement equipment. Holter ECG was recorded for 48 
hours. Medication interfering with heart rate, such as ~-

Cardiorespiratory polysomnography in patients 
with bradyarrhythmia 

Total sleep time was 372 :t: 68 minutes. RDI was 90 + 
36 per hour with a minimum value of 60 per hour and a 
maximum of 158 per hour. Patients spent 77% + 9% of 
total sleep time in non-REM sleep I/II, 3% + 5% in non- 
REM m/Iv, and 19% + 6% in REM sleep. Mean nocturnal 
Sao 2 was 83% + 9% and mean Sao 2 before apnea/hypo- 
pnea was 88% + 9%. Patients with bradyarrhythmia had a 
significantly higher RDI than those without (Table I). 

Twenty-four-hour Halter ECG in patients with 

bradyarrhythmia 

All patients with apnea-associated bradyarrhythmia 
had severe obstructive sleep apnea with an RDI of at 
least 60 per hour. Ninety-seven of all 239 study patients 
were found to have more than 60 RDI per hour, giving 
a frequency of patients with heart block of 18% in this 
group. During the 24-hour period of ECG analysis 1575 
episodes of nocturnal bradyarrhythmia were recorded: 
989 sinus arrests (maximum duration 11 seconds), 564 
episodes of second-degree atrioventricular block type 
Mobitz II (maximum duration 6 seconds), and 22 
episodes of third-degree atrioventricular block (maxi- 
mum duration 16 seconds). Table II delineates the char- 
acteristics of the episodes of bradyarrhythmia in each 

patient. Bradyarrhythmia episodes exclusively occurred 
in association with sleep-disordered breathing. 

Bradyarrhythmia and hypoxia 

Seventy-six percent of bradyarrhythmia episodes 
were associated with apnea/hypopnea episodes of 
more than 30 seconds in duration, whereas only 40% of 
all apnea/hypopnea episodes had a duration more than 
30 seconds. Eight hundred eighty-four bradyarrhythmia 
episodes (60%) were recorded during apnea/hypopnea, 
with an Sao 2 lower than 72%. Of all apnea/hypopnea 
episodes, 40% were accompanied by an Sao x <72%. 

The comparison between apnea/hypopnea with and 
without bradyarrhythmia revealed no significant differ- 
ence of Sao 2 at the beginning of apnea/hypopnea (87% 

+ 8% vs 88% + 9%). The mean end-apneic Sao 2 at which 
bradyarrhythmia occurred was 71% + 9% and thus lower 
than in apnea/hypopnea without BA (75% + 10%); (P < 
.01; Figure 1). The mean ASao 2 in apnea/hypopnea 
with bradyarrhythmia was 16% + 8%, in apnea/hypop- 
nea without bradyarrhythmia 13% + 7% (P < .01). Fig- 
ure 2 shows the distribution of different classes of oxy- 
gen saturation values from apnea/hypopnea episodes 
with and without bradyarrhythmia. 
Bradyarrhythmia and sleep stage 

Bradyarrhythmia mainly occurred during REM sleep 
(66.6%), was less frequent in non-REM sleep I/II 
(33.1%), and only occurred in 0.3% during non-REM 
sleep III/IV. Because REM sleep amounts to a propor- 
tion of 19% of total sleep time, significantly more 
episodes of sinus arrest and atrioventricular block were

arrhythmia in different classes of end-apneic oxygen 
saturation values (5% intervals) from REM and non-REM 
sleep are demonstrated in Figure 3. A linear relation 

between number of bradyarrhythmia episodes and end- 
apneic oxygen saturation values could not be found.

The major findings of the study are: (1) Patients with 
apnea-associated bradyarrhythmias are more over- 
weight than patients without bradyarrhythmia. The

found a low prevalence of bradyarrhythmia in 76 
patients with obstructive sleep apnea and no differ- 
ence of bradyarrhythmia frequency compared with a 
control group of patients without obstructive sleep 
apnea. Mean body mass index of the patients with 
sleep apnea was only 32.9 kg/m 2 and they had a mean 
apnea/hypopnea index of 33.0 per hour. 

None of our patients with an RDI below 60 per hour 
had bradyarrhythmia, whereas 17 of the 97 with an RDI 
of at least 60 per hour did. Among the study population 
by Stegman et all0 2 patients had mild to moderate sleep 
apnea (apnea/hypopnea index 9.2 and 34 per hour, 
respectively) and 6 had severe sleep apnea (apnea/hypop- 
nea index 55 to 84 per hour). In the group of 16 patients 
with nocturnal bradyarrhythmia the mean apnea/hypop- 
nea index was 76 per hour with a range of 12 to 152 
per hour. 4 Whether the presence of bradyarrhythmia 
depends on the severity of OSA or if severity of RDI only 
reflects the degree of obesity in patients with apnea-asso- 
ciated bradyarrhythmia is still unclear. 

GuiUeminault et al3 reported bradyarrhythmia in 
patients with obstructive sleep apnea exclusively during 
apnea episodes with an oxygen saturation below 72%. 
The analysis of our data cannot confirm this finding, only 
that 60% of bradyarrhythmia episodes were found below 
this threshold. Some patients have sinus arrest and heart 
block develop in REM sleep with only mild desaturation. 
Bradyarrhythmia occurred in 6.2% of apnea/hypopnea 
episodes with an oxygen desaturation of 5% or less. A lin- 
ear relaUon between frequency of bradyarrhythmia and 
end-apneic Sao 2 could not be found. 

There is little data on the impact of sleep stage on 
nocturnal bradyarrhythmia in patients with sleep apnea. 
GuiUeminault et a13 reported the occurrence of heart 
block in non-REM sleep stage II and REM sleep. In 2 dif- 
ferent studies from our group we found an increase of 
the frequency of heart block during REM sleep.4, s REM 
sleep is characterized by a high variability of heart rate, 
which may be caused by differences between tonic and 
phasic REM. In this study the majority of bradyarrhyth- 
mia was also found in REM sleep. In 16 of 17 patients 
bradyarrhythmia episodes were associated with REM 
sleep stage; 397 episodes of heart block occurred 
mainly during non-REM sleep in only 1 patient. 

Despite the same degree of desaturation, decrease in 
heart rate is more pronounced during REM sleep than 
during non-REM sleep. It could be assumed that REM 
sleep leads to severe bradycardia by excessive auto- 
nomic response from higher sensitivity of barorecep- 
tars caused by systemic arterial pressure swings. Harley 
et al ix found baroreflex sensitivity especially increased 
during REM sleep. Somerset all3 proposed baroreflex 
impairment, mainly found in patients with arterial 
hypertension and heart failure, to be susceptible for 
excessive autonomic response in patients with sleep 

apnea. In this context it is interesting to note that the 
majority of patients with obstructive sleep apnea and 
bradyarrhythmia have systemic arterial hypertension. 
Arterial hypertension was present in 71% of the 
patients with bradyarrhythmi. "a and in only 46% of those 
without. In the group of 16 patients who underwent 
electrophysiologic evaluation, 81% had arterial hyper- 
tension. 4 Sato et alt4 found the bradycardiac response 
during apnea or breathholding under hypoxemia more 
likely to occur in patients with obstructive sleep apnea 
and individual high hypoxic chemosensitivity. 

It is known that the vagaUy mediated bradycardia is the 
primary response to hypoxemia and chemoreceptor 
stimulation, which is normally overriden by vagalytic pul- 
monary inflation reflex. 15-18 Apneic bradycardia, which 
might be considered a cardioprotective mechanism 
because of llmitating oxygen consumption of the heart, 
is reported to be closely related to hypoxemia. Zwillich 
et al5 concluded that cessaUon of ventilation and hypox- 
emia is a necessary combination in the development of 
cyclic variation of heart rate and bradycardia. When 
hypoxemia during apnea is prevented by oxygen breath- 
ing, bradycardia is eliminated or is markedly reduced. 
The fact that bradycardia and bradyarrhythmia are com- 
pletely prevented by administraUon of atropine supports 
the concept of a vagally mediated reflex mechanism. 2.19 

Taking our results into account, the following charac- 
teristics seem to predispose paUents with obstructive 
sleep apnea to bradyarrhythmia: Severe obesity, a high 
RDI, REM sleep, and arterial hypertension. Coronary heart 
disease and dysfiancUons of sinus node and atrioventricu- 
lar conduction system can be excluded as causal mecha- 
nisms of bradyarrhythmia. Bradyarrhythmias are undoubt- 
edly caused by heightened parsympathetic tone, but the 
precise mechanisms affecting the imbalance of sympa- 
thetic/parasympathetic tone are not clearly understood. 
The baroreflex-chemoreflex interaction may have patho- 
physiologic implications in patients with obstructive 
sleep apnea and arterial hypertension. Further investiga- 
tions are necessary to elucidate the mechanisms that lead 
to vagaUy mediated reflex bradyarrhythmia.
