Summary 
Bruxism 
or 
tooth 
grinding 
is 
an 
oral 
habit 
that 
frequently 
occurs 
during 
sleep. 
Some 
authors 
suggest 
it 
is 
associated 
to 
sleep 
apnea. 
Objective: 
The 
main 
goal 
of 
this 
study 
is 
compare 
the 
incidence 
of 
bruxism 
before 
and 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
(T 
& 
A 
surgery) 
in 
children 
with 
sleep-disordered 
breathing. 
Methods: 
This 
is 
a 
prospective 
study 
in 
which 
we 
evaluated 
69 
consecutive 
children 
from 
the 
Otolaryngology 
Department 
of 
the 
University 
of 
São 
Paulo 
Medical 
School 
in 
pre-and 
post-surgical 
periods 
of 
adenotonsillectomy. 
Before 
and 
after 
surgery 
parents 
answered 
a 
questionnaire 
about 
sleep-disturbed 
breathing 
and 
bruxism. 
Children 
were 
submitted 
to 
E.N.T. 
examination 
and 
speech 
pathologist 
evaluation. 
The 
orthodontist 
inspected 
malocclusion. 
Before 
surgery 
all 
the 
69 
children 
presented 
sleep 
apnea 
and 
45.6% 
presented 
bruxism. 
Malocclusion 
could 
be 
found 
in 
60.71%. 
Three 
months 
after 
surgery 
none 
of 
the 
children 
presented 
breathing 
problems 
and 
only 
11.8% 
presented 
bruxism. 
There 
was 
no 
difference 
in 
malocclusion. 
Conclusion: 
This 
study 
suggests 
that 
there 
is 
a 
positive 
correlation 
between 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
and 
bruxism. 
There 
was 
an 
important 
improvement 
of 
bruxism 
after 
T 
& 
A 
surgery. 
Otolaryngologists 
must 
be 
aware 
that 
this 
pernicious 
sleep 
disorder 
is 
associated 
to 
airway 
obstruction 
and 
so, 
it 
must 
be 
considered 
when 
evaluatingT&A 
hyperplasia.

Introduction 
Bruxism 
or 
tooth 
grinding 
is 
a 
parafunctional 
habit 
that 
occurs 
during 
sleep 
[1,2]. 
Bruxism 
is 
not 
very 
common 
in 
the 
otorhinolaryngological 
literature, 


.

but 
it 
is 
a 
very 
frequent 
complaint 
of 
parents 
of 
children 
with 
mouth 
breathing. 
Its 
prevalence 
in 
children 
varies 
around 
5—40% 
[3,4]. 


It 
is 
hypothesized 
that 
bruxism 
correlates 
to 
dental 
occlusion 
or 
psychogenic 
factors 
[5]. 
Some 
authors 
suggest 
there 
is 
a 
correlation 
between 
bruxism 
and 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
[2,6], 
however 
there 
are 
no 
series 
about 
treatment 
of 
sleep 
apnea/upper 
airway 
obstruction 
and 
improvement 
of 
bruxism. 


Bruxism 
has 
been 
linked 
to 
craniomandibular 
disorders 
including 
headaches, 
temporomandibular 
joint 
discomfort, 
muscle 
aches 
and 
premature 
loss 
of

Children 
with 
bruxism 
present 
abnormal 
tooth 
wear 
(Fig.

and 
damage 
of 
the 
structures 
surrounding 
the 
teeth 
[6]. 


Sleep 
apnea 
may 
lead 
to 
major 
problems 
such 
as 
poor 
school 
performance, 
cor 
pulmonale 
[7], 
non-specific 
behavior 
disorders, 
developmental 
delay 
and 
daytime 
sleepiness 
and 
distraction 
[8]. 
Commonly 
they 
have 
frequent 
arousals, 
nightmares 
or 
nocturnal 
enuresis 
[8]. 
Increase 
of 
heart 
and 
respiratory 
rate 
as 
well 
as 
movement 
arousals 
have 
been 
reported 
to 
be 
associated 
with 
bruxism, 
as 
well 
as 
sleep 
apnea 
[1]. 


Tonsillar 
hyperplasia 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
common 
disorders 
in 
the 
E.N.T. 
office 
and 
one 
of 
the 
main 
causes 
of 
sleep 
disordered 
breathing. 
Bruxism 
is 
a 


common 
complaint 
of 
parents 
of 
mouth-breathing 
children. 


The 
main 
goal 
of 
this 
study 
is 
compare 
the

Material 
andmethods 
We 
studied 
69 
consecutive 
patients 
(33 
males 
and 
36 
females), 
with 
tonsillar 
hyperplasia 
and 
sleep 
disordered 
breathing 
from 
2 
to 
12 
years 
old. 
They 
were 
evaluated 
before 
and 
3 
months 
after 
the 
T 
& 
A 
surgery, 
in 
the

Exclusion 
criteria 
were: 
former 
personal 
or 
familiar 
history 
of 
cleft 
palate 
and 
other 
craniofacial 
syndromes; 
buccal, 
pharyngeal, 
craniofacial 
or 
nasal 
surgery; 
and 
previous 
or 
present 
orthodontic 
treatment. 


A 
thorough 
history 
about 
sleep 
and 
breathing 
disorders 
that 
could 
classify 
them 
according 
to 
the 
level 
of 
obstructive 
symptom 
was 
recorded 
for 
each 
patient. 
All 
69 
chosen 
children 
presented 
severe 
levels 
of 
disordered 
breathing 
(habitual 
snoring 
associated 
to 
marked 
clinical 
presentation 
of 
apnea 
and 
restless 
sleep 
(Scheme 
1)). 
E.N.T. 
physical 
examination 
determined 
size 
of 
palatine 
tonsils 
and 
obstruction 
of 
oropharynx 
according 
to 
Brodsky 
[9]. 
Size 
of 
pharyngeal 
tonsil 
and 
obstruction 
of 
the 
nasopharynx 
was 
determined 
by 
lateral 
X-rays 
of 
the 
head. 


The 
orthodontist 
examined 
pre-and 
post-operatively, 
all 
children 
to 
diagnose 
malocclusion, 
such 
as 
over-bite, 
open-bite, 
cross-bite 
and 
maxillar 
hypoplasia. 


The 
speech 
pathologist 
interviewed 
parents 
about 
bruxism 
and 
oral 
habits 
such 
as 
bottle 
feeding, 
thumb-sucking, 
and 
use 
of 
pacifiers. 


Three 
months 
after 
surgery, 
parents 
were 
interviewed 
again 
with 
the 
same 
questions 
about 
breathing, 
sleep, 
and 
bruxism. 


Pre-and 
post-surgical 
data 
were 
submitted 
to 
statistical 
analysis. 
The 
tests 
used 
were 
Qui-square 
and 
McNemar. 


The 
Committee 
on

Results 
Sixty-nine 
children 
from 
2 
to 
12 
years 
of 
age 
were 
submitted 
to 
T&A 
surgery. 
All 
of 
them 
presented 
sleep-disordered 
breathing. 
There 
were 
36 
girls 
and 
33 
boys. 
According 
to 
the 
distribution 
of 
races 
we 
found 
64.82% 
white; 
25.92% 
mulatto, 
and 
9.26% 
black.

All 
the 
children 
had 
at 
least 
75% 
obstruction 
of 
nasopharynx 
by 
adenoids. 
Sizes 
of 
tonsils 
in 
the 
oral 
cavity 
were 
grade 
III 
or 
IV. 
Most 
of 
the 
children 
presented 
mixed 
dentition 
(68.2%) 
and 
60.71% 
of 
the 
children 
had 
the 
diagnosis 
of 
malocclusion. 


Three-months 
after 
surgery, 
none 
of 
the 
children 
presented 
with 
symptoms 
of 
disturbed 
breathing, 
but 
23.19% 
maintained 
the 
habit 
of 
mouth 
breathing. 
There 
was 
no 
difference 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
malocclusion 
in 
children 
after 
surgery. 


No 
correlation 
was 
found 
between 
bruxism 
and 
use 
of 
pacifiers, 
bottle-feeding 
or 
thumb-sucking. 


The 
prevalence 
of 
bruxism 
in 
the 
pre-and 
post-surgical 
evaluation 
can 
be 
seen 
in

There 
was 
a 
significant 
reduction 
in 
bruxism 
after 
surgery.

Discussion 
One 
of 
the 
main 
causes 
of 
sleep 
apnea 
in 
children 
is 
tonsillar 
hyperplasia 
[10]. 
Removal 
of 
tonsils 
and 
adenoids 
(adenotonsillectomy) 
is 
the 
treatment 
of 
choice 
in 
those 
cases 
[11]. 


History 
and 
physical 
examination 
has 
a 
high 
predictive 
value 
(about 
90—100%) 
in 
the 
diagnosis 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
in 
children, 
[12]. 
A 
classification 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
is 
possible 
using 
a 
comprehensive 
history 
of 
the 
patient 
and 
classification 
in 
grades 
[13]. 


Snoring 
and 
mouth 
breathing 
are 
very 
common 
symptoms 
and 
so, 
are 
often 
considered 
of 
minor 
priority 
by 
parents. 
In 
those 
cases, 
the 
diagnosis 
of 
sleep 
apnea 
may 
be 
delayed 
over 
2 
years 
[8]. 


Many 
factors 
may 
be 
associated 
to 
bruxism 
[14]. 
Dental 
occlusion 
may 
contribute 
[5]. 
In 
this 
series 
we 
found 
nearly 
60% 
incidence 
of 
malocclusion, 
similar 
to 
others 
earlier 
[15]. 
Obstruction 
of 
upper 
airways 
results 
in 
mouth 
breathing 
which 
may 
lead 
to 
abnormalities 
in 
the 
dentofacial 
development 
and 
malocclusion 
[16]. 


Although 
we 
found 
a 
high 
incidence 
of 
malocclusion 
and 
bruxism 
before 
surgery, 
we 
observed 
a

(Figs.

and

This 
finding 
corroborates 
Mark 
[2], 
that 
there 
is 
a 
correlation 
between 
children 
with 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
and 
bruxism. 
Ohayon 
et 
al. 
[6] 
state 
that 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
is 
the 
highest 
risk 
factor 
for 
tooth 
grinding 
during 
sleep. 


Bruxism 
occurs 
mainly 
in 
stage 
2 
and 
R.E.M. 
sleep. 
Many 
bruxism 
episodes 
lead 
to 
a 
shift 
in 
sleep 
stage, 
usually 
toward 
awakening 
or 
lighter 
sleep, 
suggesting 
that 
bruxism 
may 
be 
part 
of 
an 
arousal 
phenomenon 
[17], 
during 
the 
same 
period 
of 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea. 


Children 
with 
sleep 
apnea 
present 
with 
frequent 
arousals 
during 
sleep. 
Bruxism 
is 
associated 
with 
fragmented 
sleep 
[18]. 
Arousals 
during 
sleep 
lead 
to 
an 
increase 
in 
parafunctional 
activity, 
including 
the 
masticatory 
activity 
[19]. 
Activation 
of 
upper 
airway 
muscles 
to 
increase 
their 
tone 
compensates 
for 
the 
narrowing 
of 
air 
passages. 
[20]. 
Children 
with 
airway 
obstruction 
pull 
the 
jaw 
forward 
to 
mechanically 
maintain 
better 
airway 
patency. 
This 
may 
stimulate 
receptors 
in 
the 
upper 
airway 
to 
increased 
airway 
tone, 
leading 
to 
bruxism 
[19]. 


5. 
Conclusion 
We 
conclude 
that 
there 
is 
a 
correlation 
between 
bruxism 
and 
adenoid 
and 
tonsilar 
hypertrophy, 
that 
is 
strongly 
correlated 
to 
upper 
airway 
obstruction.
T&A 
surgery 
contributes 
to 
improve 
bruxism 
in 
these 
children. 
E.N.T. 
doctors, 
pediatricians, 
speech 
pathologists, 
and 
dentists 
should 
be 
aware 
of 
this 
and 
investigate 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
in 
cases 
of 
bruxism.
