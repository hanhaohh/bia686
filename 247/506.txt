This study of sleep changes in patients with cluster headache (CH) was conducted 
in view of the nocturnal predominance of this condition, the efficacy of oxygen 
and the fact that the attacks follow oxygen desaturation. Proposed mechanisms 
include impairment of carotid body activity secondary to hypothalamic vasomotor 
regulatory dysfunction. Sixteen patients with episodic CH and 29 healthy 
volunteers underwent nocturnal polysomnography. Five (31.3%) patients with 
episodic CH were found to have sleep apnoea (SA). Two patients with SA experienced 
two attacks during the study period. The attacks followed episodes of 
oxygen desaturation and were associated with REM sleep. In two patients with 
SA and CH, treatment with continuous positive airway pressure abolished their 
oxygen desaturation, sleep apnoeas and headaches. Our study confirmed the high 
percentage of CH associated with SA. We suggest that oxygen desaturation may 
be a trigger factor in some patients and play a role in the pathogenesis of CH.

Introduction 

Cluster headache (CH), firmly established as the 
most excruciating chronic headache in intensity, is 
a rare syndrome and shows unique clinical features 
(1). Descriptions regarding the clinical features of 
this condition have been made for more than two 
centuries. Although extensive studies have been 
conducted, the pathophysiology of this condition 
remains obscure (2). One of the most striking features 
of CH is the periodicity of the attacks. The 
attacks are short-lived and followed by a pain-free 
interval. They also occur during cluster periods, on 
the same day, with predictable periodicity. Additionally, 
50–60% of the attacks occur often or exclusively 
at night (3). The relation between headaches and 
sleep has been known for more than a century (4). 
Further studies showed an increased prevalence of 
obstructive apnoea syndrome in patients with CH 
compared with the general population, and that the 
attacks could be triggered by oxygen desaturation. 
In these cases, treatment with continuous positive 
airway pressure (CPAP) was shown to abort the 
cluster (5). 

These studies may add information to the current 
pathophysiological hypotheses and, above all, offer 
other therapeutic options that might benefit the 
patients. 

Hypothalamic involvement has been suggested 
in CH due to the periodicity of the CH, probably 
as a result of the circadian rhythm. This hypothalamic 
dysfunction is believed to cause autonomic 
nervous system involvement. Specifically, it is suggested 
that during the cluster period the activity of 
chemoreceptors would be impaired by the central 
inhibition of the sympathetic vasomotor tone and 
parasympathetic stimulation. Thus, CH may be the 
result of decreased sympathetic activity and stimulation 
of parasympathetic disinhibition in the 
carotid body. Attacks occurring as a direct result of 
these abnormalities are unlikely. Rather, they may 
occur as a result of physiological involvement 
combined with facilitating conditions, such as inhibition 
of respiratory muscles during the REM 
phase of sleep; bradycardia and hypoventilation in 
the nREM phase of sleep; use of vasodilator 
agents; altitude-related hypoxia; and sleep apnoea 
(6).

Goadsby, using positron emission tomography, 
reported ipsilateral hypothalamic activation in 
patients during the attacks (7, 8). According to this 
author, these findings warrant the inclusion of CH 
in the category of neurovascular disorders. 

Methods 

Sixteen out-patients (14 male and two female, 26– 
55 years of age, mean age 40 years) were studied. 
Their clinical history was taken, they underwent 
neurological examination and the following tests: 
blood cell count, electrocardiography (ECG), computed 
tomography (CT) of the brain and nocturnal 
polysomnography. All patients met the International 
Headache Society criteria for the diagnosis of episodic 
CH. In accordance with the main objectives of 
the study, patients with concomitant heart disease, 
pulmonary disease or haematological disease were 
excluded, as the presence of these conditions would 
be likely to bias the results. The presence of significant 
brain CT abnormalities was also established as 
an exclusion criterion. 

Upon questioning, none of the patients spontaneously 
reported snoring, daytime sleepiness or any 
other sleep disorder. Before the physical examination, 
the patients recorded their daytime sleepiness 
on a scale called Epworth scale. This scale uses a 
scoring system (0 = none, 1 = small, 2 = moderate, 3 
= high) to record the odds of falling asleep in the 
following situations: reading while sitting, watching 
television, traveling by car during 1 h, lying down 
during the afternoon rest, talking with another person, 
while sitting after a dinner without alcohol 
ingestion, when the car stops for some minutes in 
traffic, and while sitting down, inactive, in public 
places (theatres, cinemas, etc.). The result is considered 
normal if the sum of the items described above 
provides a score not higher than 7. Scores above this 
value are associated with a high likelihood of sleep 
apnoea. This scale is not designed to determine the 
severity or the prognosis of the condition, but is a 
useful contributor for the indication of polysomnography 
(9). The polysomnographic studies included 
EEG, right and left electro-oculogram, submental 
muscle electromyograms, right and left anterior tibial 
muscles electromyograms, ECG, nasal and oral 
termistors for the evaluation of the airflow, thoracic 
and abdominal excursion and finger oximetry. The 
studies were evaluated by the same person. Apnoea 
was defined as complete airflow cessation for =10 s 
during sleep. Hypopnoea was defined as a reduction 
in airflow for =10 s, with chest excursions that led 
to a =4% oxyhaemoglobin desaturation, arousal, or 

awakening. The apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI) 
was calculated as the number of recorded apnoeas 
and hypopnoeas divided by the total hours of sleep 
(10). Both are generally associated with desaturation 
and arousal, detected through the EEG. Oxygen 
desaturation is considered clinically significant 
when it is =4% inferior to the baseline saturation 
value of each patient (11). 

Patients were seen during cluster periods, while 
using prophylactic medication on a regular basis. 
The medication was discontinued 1 week before 
the nocturnal polysomnography was conducted. 
Twenty-nine individuals were enrolled in the control 
group (26 male and three female, 19–59 years of age, 
mean 37 years). These individuals were comparable 
in terms of age and body mass index (BMI). There 
were more males than females. The patients did not 
complain of headache, or had any other physical 
abnormalities. 

The data related to the study variables were analysed, 
and are presented in the following tables. The 
statistical analysis was conducted using the Wald 
c2 used to assess the association among variables; 
Student’s t-test to compare the means; and the 
non-parametric Mann–Whitney test to compare 
extremely variable measures of both samples. 
Pearson’s linear coefficient of correlation (r) was 
used to assess the dependence among values of the 
variables. The significance level was established at a 
probability of 5% (P < 0.05). 

Results 

In patients with CH, the age of symptom onset 
ranged from 14 to 48 years, with a mean age of 

30.9 years. Eight patients (50%) suffered from the 
pain mainly at night, but none of the patients suffered 
from the pain exclusively during sleep. The 
pain was most incident between 02.00 h and 03.00 h. 
The results of both groups were tabulated and categorized 
as group 1 (patients with CH) and group 2 
(patients from the control group: Table 1, group 1; 
and Table 2, group 2. 
According to the criteria of abnormality, of the 16 
patients studied in the first group, five presented 
with SA (AHI > 5/h), corresponding to 31.3%. Of 
the 29 patients in the control group, three presented 
with SA, corresponding to 10.3% (P = 0.08). When 
the results obtained from the patients with CH 
(31.3%) were compared with those of the general 
population (2–4%), a significant difference was 
found (P < 0.05). The comparison with the control 
group was also significant (P = 0.08). There were

chronic form (3). Chervin et al. conducted a polysomnography 
study in 25 patients with CH, and 
found that 80% of these patients had sleep-
disordered breathing (10). The BMI was not 
assessed, and this could have biased the statistical 
findings. The lack of control groups also impaired 
the analysis. 

Our study reports only two attacks occurring during 
polysomnography in two patients with OSAS. 
Both occurred during REM sleep, after an episode of 
desaturation. These numbers, albeit limited, are consistent 
with those reported in the literature, which 
consider oxygen desaturation a trigger factor or a 
factor related to the pathophysiology of the disease. 
In our study, the sleep structure abnormalities found 
in patients with CH were not significant compared 
with those in the control group. However, a reduction 
in REM sleep was found in patients with CH, 
perhaps reflecting more episodes of arousal. An 
increased prevalence of PLM was detected among 
our patients; however, the comparison with the control 
group was not significant, and demonstrated an 
increase of PLM among all the study individuals. 
The sleep structure abnormalities found in the 
patients with CH in our study were not significant 
when compared with the control group, although 
the control patients showed a decrease in REM sleep. 
It is believed that these structural abnormalities can 
happen in the first night of a study due to the 
difficulties of the patients in adjusting to the new 
environment. 

The attacks are usually associated with high altitudes, 
REM sleep and use of alcohol, histamine or 
sublingual nitroglycerin. All these factors may cause 
a state of hypoxaemia in the absence of a normal 
reflex chemoreceptor response. Thus, Kudrow proposed 
that, during the time in which the chemoreceptor 
activity remains abnormal due to the changes 
in autonomic activity, hypoxaemic stimuli acting 
over a deregulated threshold would cause a hyperactive 
reflex chemoreceptor response (13). This 
theory is supported by the efficacy of oxygen administration 
during the attacks. It seems that O2 inhibits 
the excessive excitability of chemoreceptors. Other 
authors believe that oxygen’s vasoconstrictor 
activity in cranial and extracranial vessels would 
account for the improvement of the pain. The 
association with sleep apnoea emerged after 

CH associated with sleep apnoea 279 

analysing the polysomnographic findings, which 
showed that the attacks were triggered by episodes 
of desaturation. 

Of the five patients with OSAS, two were treated 
with CPAP and their pain symptoms improved. Both 
were unresponsive to pharmacotherapy. After CPAP, 
both showed complete resolution of the pain. These 
patients have now been followed for 15 and 
13 months, respectively. The first patient reported 
resolution for 1 year and the other patient reported 
resolution for 8 months. The time in remission 
seemed to have increased in both patients after treatment 
with CPAP. There is a similar case described in 
the literature (5). This finding might favour a new 
therapeutic option for these patients with CH associated 
with OSAS.
