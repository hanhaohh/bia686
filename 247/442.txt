Objective: 
To 
evaluate 
the 
outcome 
of 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
(OSA) 
in 
children 
using 
objective 
data 
from 
polysomnography 
supplemented 
by 
subjective 
proxy 
reports 
from 
the 
OSA-18 
quality 
of

instrument. 


Study 
Design: 
Prospective 
cohort 
study. 


Methods: 
Children 
3 
to 
14 
years 
of 
age 
with 
OSA 
diagnosed 
principally 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
polysomnography 
as 
having 
an 
obstructive 
apnea/hypopnea 
index 
(AHI) 
of 
5 
or 
greater 
underwent 
adenotonsillectomy. 
OSA 
was 
classified 
as 
mild 
(AHI 
. 
5 
. 
10), 
moderate 
(AHI 
. 
10 
. 
20), 
or 
severe 
(AHI 
20). 
Children 
enrolled 
in 
the 
study 
also 
had 
postoperative 
polysomnography 
3 
to 
6 
months 
after 
surgery. 
Caregivers 
completed 
the 
OSA-18 
survey 
before 
surgery 
and 
within 
6 
months 
after 
surgery. 
Pearson 
correlation 
was 
used 
to 
compare 
the 
pre-and 
postoperative 
AHI 
values 
with 
the 
pre-and 
postoperative 
OSA-18 
total 
scores. 
SAS 
procedures 
(SAS 
Corp., 
Cary, 
NC) 
were 
used 
for 
statistical 
analyses. 
A 
P 
value 
less 
than 
or 
equal 
to 
.05 
was 
considered 
significant. 


Results: 
The 
study 
population 
included 
79 
healthy 
children, 
40 
of 
who 
were 
male. 
The 
mean 
age 
was 
6.3 
(range, 
3.0–14.0) 
years. 
Only 
tonsillar 
size 
was 
correlated 
significantly 
with 
a 
high 
preoperative 
AHI. 
For 
all 
children, 
the 
preoperative 
AHI 
value 
was 
higher 
than 
the 
postoperative 
value. 
The 
mean 
preoperative 
AHI 
for 
the 
study 
population 
was 
27.5, 
whereas 
the 
mean 
postoperative 
AHI 
was 
3.5. 
This 
change 
was 
highly 
significant 
(P 
. 
.001). 
The 
percentage 
of 
children 
with 
normal 
polysomnography 
parameters 
after

Overnight 
respiratory 


parameters 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
were 
normal 
for 
all 


children 
with 
mild 
OSA. 
Three 
(12%)

OSA, 
and 
13 
(36%) 
children 
with 
severe

had 
persistent

occurred 
in 
all

Caregivers 


reported

(28%) 


children; 
this

Conclusions: 
Adenotonsillectomy 
for

INTRODUCTION 


Obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
(OSA) 
in 
children 
is 
a 
breathing 
disorder 
that 
occurs 
during 
sleep 
and 
is 
characterized 
by 
upper 
airway 
collapse 
that 
disrupts 
normal 
respiratory 
gas 
exchange.1 
The 
prevalence 
of 
OSA 
in 
4-year-old 
children 
is 
estimated 
to 
be 
1% 
to 
2%.2 
Although 
a 
dysfunction 
in 
neuromotor 
control 
is 
thought 
to 
be

underlying 
cause 
of 
airway 
collapse 
during 
sleep 
in 
children,
3 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy 
further 
narrows 
the 
airway 
and 
exacerbates 
OSA.4 
Consequently, 
adenotonsillectomy 
is 
the 
primary 
surgical 
therapy 
for 
OSA 
in 
children.5 


Over 
the 
last 
few 
years, 
there 
has 
been 
increasing 
evidence 
that 
pediatric 
OSA 
is 
associated 
with 
behavioral 
and 
neurocognitive 
problems 
as 
well 
as 
poor 
school 
performance, 
failure 
to 
thrive, 
and 
poor 
quality 
of 
life.6–8 
Several 
recent 
studies 
indicate 
that 
both 
the 
behavior 
and 
the 
quality 
of 
life 
of 
children 
with 
OSA 
improve 
after 
adenotonsillectomy.7–9 


The 
most 
accurate 
and 
comprehensive 
method 
for 
the 
diagnosis 
of 
OSA 
is 
full-night 
polysomnography.10 
The 
relative 
severity 
of 
OSA 
may 
also 
be 
quantified 
using 
polysomnography. 
This 
is 
an 
important 
consideration 
because 
it 
permits 
the 
distinction 
between 
OSA 
and 
milder 
forms 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
for 
which 
surgery 
may 
be 
inappropriate 
therapy.11 


The 
outcome 
of 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA 
can 
be 
evaluated 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
objective 
evidence 
using 
data 
from 
pre-and 
postoperative 
polysomnography. 
To 
date, 
however, 
reports 
on 
the 
use 
of 
polysomnography 
to 
evaluate 
outcomes 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA 
in 
children 
have 
been 
limited 
for 
several 
reasons. 
First, 
there 
are 
relatively 
few 
sleep 
centers 
available 
for 
young 
children, 
and 
full-night 
polysomnography 
is 
a 
time-consuming 
procedure. 
Second, 
polysomnography 
is 
expensive, 
and 
third-party 
payers 
are 
reluctant 
to 
authorize 
polysomnography 
for 
children 
when 
clinical 
diagnosis 
suggests 
OSA. 
Finally, 
even 
though 
polysomnography 
may 
be 
approved 
as 
a 
diagnostic 
procedure 
for 
OSA, 
it 
is 
rarely 
approved 
to 
assess 
the 
outcome 
of 
adenotonsillectomy. 
As 
a 
consequence, 
investigators 
have 
been 
forced 
to 
rely 
on 
clinical 
criteria 
to 
evaluate 
outcomes. 
To 
complicate 
the 
issue, 
only 
limited 
normative 
data 
exist 
for 
pediatric 
OSA, 
and 
there 
is 
a 
lack 
of 
consensus 
on 
the 
respiratory 
parameters 
that 
are 
clinically 
significant. 
It 
is 
therefore 
difficult 
to 
obtain 
both 
pre-and 
postoperative 
data 
from 
individual 
children 
with 
OSA 
and 
to 
compare 
outcomes 
with 
normative 
values.1,12,13 
These 
factors 
have 
limited 
the 
sample 
sizes 
used 
in 
published 
studies 
of 
the 
outcome 
of 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA 
evaluated 
by 
polysomnography.4,14–16 
To 
increase 
the 
sample 
size, 
outcome 
studies 
of 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA 
often 
report 
data 
for 
children 
with 
multiple 
comorbidities, 
including 
obesity, 
that 
are 
known 
to 
result 
in 
a 
poorer 
surgical 
outcome 
as 
measured 
by 
polysomnography.17 


The 
present 
study 
used 
data 
from 
pre-and 
postoperative 
polysomnography 
for 
a 
sample 
of 
children 
that 
was 
larger 
than 
any 
used 
in 
previous 
studies 
even 
though 
obese 
children, 
considered 
high-risk 
for 
persistent 
OSA,17 
were 
excluded. 
This 
relatively 
large 
sample 
provided 
sufficient 
statistical 
power 
to 
examine 
potential 
confounders 
such 
as 
age, 
ethnicity, 
and 
socioeconomic 
status 
that 
may 
affect 
the 
diagnosis 
of 
OSA 
and 
impact 
the 
outcome 
of 
surgery. 
Because 
data 
on 
pre-and 
postoperative 
polysomnography 
were 
available 
for 
all 
children 
included 
in 
the 
study, 
it 
was 
possible 
to 
examine 
outcomes 
for 
children 
with 
different 
severities 
of 
OSA. 
Outcomes 
were 
also 
evaluated 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
different 
diagnostic 
standards 
for 
OSA. 
In 
addition, 
data 
from 
polysomnography 
were 
cor


related 
with 
pre-and 
postoperative 
results 
from 
the 
OSA-18 
quality 
of 
life 
instrument. 
The 
goal 
was 
to 
provide 
a 
comprehensive 
assay 
of 
surgical 
outcomes 
including 
both 
objective 
data 
from 
polysomnography 
and 
subjective 
proxy 
reports 
of 
symptoms 
of 
OSA. 


The 
study 
is 
divided 
into 
four 
sections: 
1) 
review 
(Appendix 
I, 
online) 
of 
the 
literature 
on 
polysomnography 
as 
an 
outcome 
measure 
for 
children 
who 
undergo 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA; 
2) 
methods 
used 
to 
collect 
and 
analyze 
data 
from 
polysomnography 
and 
quality 
of 
life 
instruments 
before 
and 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA; 
3) 
results 
and 
an 
analysis 
of 
data 
gathered 
by 
these 
methods; 
and 
4) 
discussion 
of 
the 
significance 
of 
the 
findings. 
The 
discussion 
focuses 
on 
gaps 
in 
our 
current 
knowledge 
of 
the 
outcome 
of 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA 
based 
on 
the 
literature 
review. 
It 
also 
presents 
a 
comparison 
of 
objective 
and 
subjective 
methods 
for 
evaluating 
the 
outcome 
of 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA 
in 
children 
based 
principally 
on 
the 
current 
data 
and 
offers 
approaches 
to 
future 
research 
on 
surgical 
therapy 
for 
OSA 
in 
children.

of 
the 
University 
of 
New

Caregivers 
were 
asked 
to 
complete 
an 
informed 
consent 
document 
prior 
to 
enrollment 
in 
the 
study 
between 
January 
1, 
2001 
and 
December 
31,

Children 
were 
included 
if 
they 
had 
signs

3 
months 
duration 
and 
were 
shown 
to 
have 
OSA 
by 
polysomnography. 
The 
objective 
criteria 
for 
OSA 
based 
on 
polysomnography 
were 
an 
obstructive 
apnea/hypopnea 
index 
(AHI) 
equal 
to

Study 
Protocol 


Children 
underwent 
a 
routine 
medical 
history 
and 
physical 
examination. 
Data 
were 
obtained 
on 
the 
following 
parameters: 
age, 
sex, 
ethnicity, 
systemic 
comorbidities, 
height, 
weight, 
and 
tonsillar 
size. 
Caregivers 
were 
asked 
to 
identify 
their 
ethnicity 
as 
Hispanic 
or 
Latino, 
non-Hispanic 
or 
Latino 
white, 
black, 
Native 
American, 
Asian, 
or 
“other” 
using 
criteria 
established 
by 
the 
U. 
S. 
Census 
Bureau.19 
The 
age-and 
sex-corrected 
BMI 
were 
calculated 
for 
each 
child 
using 
established 
guidelines,18 
and 
children 
were 
divided 
into 
three 
groups 
as 
follows: 
group 
1 
(underweight), 
less 
than 
or 
equal 
to 
the 
5th 
percentile; 
group 
2 
(normal), 
more 
than 
the 
5th 
percentile 
but 
less 
than 
the 
85th 
percentile; 
group 
3 
(at 
risk 
of 
overweight), 
more 
than 
the 
85th 
percentile 
but 
less 
than 
the 
95th 
percentile. 
Tonsils 
were 
graded 
as 
follows: 
1) 
small 
tonsils 
confined 
to 
the 
tonsillar 
pillars; 
2) 
tonsils 
that 
extend 
just 
outside 
the 
pillars; 
3) 
tonsils 
that 
extended 
outside 
the 
pillars 
but 
did 
not 
meet 
in 
the 
midline; 
4) 
large 
tonsils 
that 
met 
in 
the 
midline.20

to 
the 
neck. 
Digital 
videotaping 
with 
sound 
recording 
was 
performed 
throughout 
the 
night. 
A 
sleep 
medicine 
physician 
interpreted 
the 
results 
of 
polysomnography. 
Obstructive 
apnea 
was 
defined 
as 
a 
cessation 
of 
airflow 
through 
the 
nose 
and 
mouth 
for 
at 
least 
two 
respiratory 
cycles 
with 
paradoxical 
chest 
and 
abdominal 
movements. 
Hypopnea 
was 
defined 
as 
a 
reduction 
in 
airflow 
through 
the 
nose 
and 
mouth 
with 
paradoxical 
respiratory 
effort, 
resulting 
in 
either 
an 
arousal 
or 
an 
oxyhemoglobin 
desaturation 
of 
at 
least 
4%. 
Central 
apnea 
was 
defined 
as 
absence 
of 
airflow 
and 
respiratory 
effort 
for 
greater 
than 
or 
equal 
to 
20 
seconds 
or 
greater 
than 
or 
equal 
to 
10 
seconds 
but 
associated 
with 
a 
bradycardia 
or 
4% 
oxygen 
desaturation. 
The 
following 
respiratory 
parameters 
were 
also 
measured 
(Table 
I): 
respiratory 
disturbance 
index, 
defined 
as 
the 
average 
number 
of 
central 
and 
obstructive 
apneas 
and 
hypopneas 
per 
hour 
of 
sleep; 
obstructive 
apnea 
index, 
defined 
as 
the 
number 
of 
obstructive 
apneas 
per 
hour 
of 
sleep; 
obstructive 
hypopneas 
index, 
defined 
as 
the 
number 
of 
obstructive 
hypopneas 
per 
hour 
of 
sleep; 
AHI, 
defined 
as 
the 
number 
of 
obstructive 
apneas 
and 
hypopneas 
per 
hour 
of 
sleep; 
central 
apnea 
index, 
defined 
as 
the 
number 
of 
central 
apneas 
per 
hour 
of 
sleep. 
In 
addition, 
the 
following 
physiologic 
parameters 
were 
recorded: 
the 
mean 
oxygen 
saturation; 
the 
minimum 
oxygen 
saturation; 
the 
percentage 
of 
time 
the 
saturation 
was 
below 
92%; 
the 
end-tidal 
CO2; 
the 
total 
sleep 
time 
in 
minutes; 
the 
sleep 
efficiency; 
and 
the 
percentage 
of 
time 
the 
child 
spent 
in 
rapid 
eye 
movement 
(REM) 
sleep. 
The 
arousal 
index 
was 
also 
measured. 
This 
was 
defined 
as 
the 
number 
of 
arousals 
or 
shifts 
in 
the 
sleep 
stage 
to 
a 
“wake” 
pattern 
lasting 
more 
than 
3 
seconds 
but 
less 
than 
15 
seconds

Children 
with 
OSA 
underwent 
a 
monopolar 
adenotonsillectomy 
under 
general 
anesthesia. 
The 
tonsillectomy 
was 
performed 
with 
a 
combination 
of 
sharp 
and 
blunt 
dissection 
using 
primarily 
blade 
electrocautery. 
Adenoidectomy 
was 
performed 
using 
suction 
ablation 
and 
cautery. 


Quality 
of 
Life 


Caregivers 
were 
asked 
to 
complete 
the 
OSA-18 
quality 
of 
life 
survey21 
before 
and 
after 
surgery. 
The 
first 
survey 
was 
completed 
prior 
to 
polysomnography 
and 
the 
second 
survey 
during 
the 
follow-up 
visit 
after 
polysomnography. 
The 
survey 
comprises 
18 
items 
in 
5 
domains 
of 
sleep 
disturbance, 
physical 
suffering, 
emotional 
distress, 
daytime 
problems, 
and 
caregiver 
concerns. 
The 
domains 
of 
emotional 
distress 
and 
daytime 
problems 
contain 
three 
items, 
whereas 
the 
other 
domains 
contain 
four. 
A 
point 
scale 
is 
used 
ranging 
from 
1 
(none 
of 
the 
time) 
to 
7 
(all 
of 
the 
time) 
to 
grade 
the 
relative 
severity 
of 
the 
problem 
addressed 
in 
each 
item. 
The 
total 
score, 
the 
domain 
score, 
and 
the 
item 
score 
were 
recorded. 
Caregiver’s 
responses 
to 
the 
domain 
of 
sleep 
disturbance 
were 
also 
used 
for 
further 
analysis 
of 
factors 
associated 
with 
persistence 
of 
OSA 
after 
adenotonsillectomy. 
Children 
with 
a 
score 
greater 
than 
20 
for 
this 
domain 
had 
symptoms 
“a 
good 
bit 
of 
the 
time,” 
“most 
of 
the 
time,” 
or 
“all 
of 
the 
time” 
and 
were 
considered 
symptomatic. 
Also, 
children 
with 
loud 
snoring 
(a 
single 
item 
with 
a 
score 
greater 
than 
5) 
had 
symptoms 
“a 
good 
bit 
of 
the 
time,” 
“most 
of 
the 
time,” 
or 
“all 
of 
the 
time” 
and 
were 
considered 
symptomatic. 


Outcome 
Measures 


The 
primary 
outcome 
measure 
was 
the 
change 
in 
the 
AHI 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA 
in 
children. 
Secondary 
outcome 
measures 
included 
changes 
in 
the 
following 
parameters: 
respiratory 
disturbance 
index; 
obstructive 
apnea 
index; 
obstructive 
hypopnea 
index; 
central 
apnea 
index; 
the 
mean 
oxygen 
saturation; 
the 
minimum 
oxygen 
saturation; 
the 
percentage 
of 
time 
at 
saturation 
below 
92%; 
the 
end-tidal 
CO2; 
and 
the 
arousal 
index 
(Table 
I). 
These 
measures 
derived 
from 
polysomnography 
were 
compared 
with 
data 
from 
the 
OSA-18 
quality 
of 
life 
survey 
obtained 
before 
and 
after 
surgery.21 


Statistical 
Analysis 


Polysomnography. 
Results 
are 
expressed 
as 
mean 
. 
SD. 
Paired 
t 
tests 
were 
used 
to 
compare 
mean 
values 
of 
polysomnography 
parameters 
before 
and 
after 
adenotonsillectomy. 
Analysis 
of 
variance 
(ANOVA) 
was 
used 
to 
establish 
the 
impact 
of 
covariants 
on 
surgical 
outcomes. 
This 
was 
analyzed 
in 
two 
ways. 
First, 
the 
AHI 
was 
treated 
as 
a 
continuous 
dependent 
variable. 
It 
was 
log-transformed 
to 
correct 
for 
distribution 
problems, 
and 
an 
analysis 
of 
covariance 
was 
performed 
with 
sex, 
age, 
BMI, 
tonsillar 
size, 
and 
caregiver 
report 
of 
symptoms 
as 
covariates. 
Second, 
the 
above 
procedure 
was 
repeated 
using 
logistic 
regression 
with 
the 
AHI 
grouped 
into 
three 
categories: 
mild 
(10), 
moderate 
(10 
. 
20), 
and 
severe 
(20). 
A 
contingency 
table 
analysis 
was 
then 
performed 
to 
look 
for 
factors 
associated 
with 
surgical 
failure, 
defined 
as 
a 
postoperative 
AHI 
of 
5 
or 
greater. 


Quality 
of 
Life. 
Subtracting 
the 
mean 
postoperative 
score 
from 
the 
mean 
preoperative 
score 
derived 
the 
OSA-18 
difference 
score. 
Because 
a 
decrease 
in 
mean 
score 
implies 
improvement, 
the 
mean 
change 
is 
a 
positive 
number. 
The 
95% 
confidence 
intervals 
for 
difference 
scores 
were 
also 
calculated. 
The 
standardized 
response 
mean 
(SRM), 
defined 
as 
the 
difference 
score 
divided 
by 
the 
SD 
of 
the 
difference 
score, 
was 
used 
to 
estimate 
the 
extent 
of 
improvement 
after 
surgery.

data 
from 
polysomnography 
for 
26 
children

and 
were 
studied 
by 
Suen

were 
used

Assuming 
a

0.3 
between 
pre-and

values, 
a 
population 
of 
29 
children 
with 
similar 
mean 
pre-and 
postoperative 
values 
and 
standard 
deviations 
for 
the 
AHI 
would 
be 
sufficient 
to

Because 
a

or 
more 
is 
clinically 
significant,1 
the 
present

has 
sufficient

RESULTS 


Study 
Population 


The 
initial 
study 
population 
comprised 
182 
children. 
Sixty-four 
children 
did 
not 
meet 
inclusion 
criteria. 
Of 
the 
remaining 
118 
children, 
26 
without 
postoperative 
polysomnography 
and 
13 
with 
incomplete 
data 
were 
excluded. 
The 
final 
study 
population 
included 
79 
children, 
40 
of 
who 
were 
male. 
The 
mean 
age 
at 
the 
time 
of 
inclusion 
in 
the 
study 
was 
6.3 
(range, 
3.0–15.8) 
years. 
Forty-nine 
(62%) 
children 
were 
between 
3 
to 
6 
years, 
24 
(30%) 
children 
were 
between 
6 
to 
12 
years, 
and 
6 
(12%) 
children 
were 
over 
12 
years. 
Thirty-five 
(44%) 
children 
were 
Hispanic 
or 
Latino, 
30 
(38%) 
children 
were 
non-Hispanic 
or 
Latino 
white, 
and 
4 
(5%) 
children 
were 
Native 
Americans. 
Ethnicity 
was 
not 
identified 
in 
10 
(13%) 
children. 
Based 
on 
preoperative 
age-
and 
sex-corrected 
BMI 
percentiles, 
7 
(9%) 
children 
were 
underweight, 
64 
(81%) 
were 
of 
normal 
weight, 
and 
8 
(10%) 
were 
at 
risk 
of 
being 
overweight.18 


Polysomnography 


The 
mean 
interval 
between 
preoperative 
polysomnography 
and 
adenotonsillectomy 
was 
2.3 
(range, 
0.3–6.2) 
months. 
The 
mean 
interval 
between 
adenotonsillectomy 
and 
postoperative 
polysomnography 
was 
5.2 
(range, 
1.0 
– 
9.3) 
months. 
The 
mean 
interval 
between 
pre-and 
postoperative 
polysomnography 
was 
7.5 
(range, 
2.2–14) 
months. 


Respiratory 
and 
nonrespiratory 
parameters 
from 
polysomnography 
in 
children 
before 
and 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA 
are 
summarized 
in 
Table 
I. 
Changes 
were 
highly 
significant 
(P

in 
the 
AHI, 
respiratory

with 
oxygen 
saturation 
below 
92%, 
and 
the 
arousal 
index. 
For 
all 
children, 
the 
preoperative 
AHI 
was 
higher 
than 
the 
postoperative 
value 
(Fig. 
1). 
The 
mean 
preoperative 
value 
of 
the 
AHI 
for 
the 
study 
population 
was 
27.5, 
whereas 
the 
mean 
postoperative 
value 
was 
3.5. 
Changes 
in 
the 
mean 
oxygen 
saturation 
and 
in 
the 
central 
apnea 
index 
were 
also 
significant 
(Table 
I). 
The 
changes 
in 
mean 
sleep 
time, 
sleep 
efficiency, 
percentage 
of 
time 
spent 
in 
REM 
sleep, 
and 
in

were 
not 
significant. 


The 
number 
of

on 
the 
criteria 
used 
to 
define 
OSA 
(Table 
II). 
When 
an 
obstructive 
apnea 
index 
greater 
than 
or 
equal 
to 
1 
was 
used 
as 
the 
criterion, 
90% 
of 
children 
normalized 
after 
surgery. 
When 
the 
criterion 
was 
a 
respiratory

index 
greater 
than 
or 
equal 
to 
5, 
82% 
of 
the 
children 
normalized 
after 
adenotonsillectomy. 
In 
contrast, 
when 
either 
an 
AHI 
or 
respiratory 
disturbance 
index 
equal 
to 
or 
less 
than 
1 
was 
used 
as 
the 
criterion, 
only 
71% 
of 
children 
normalized 
after 
surgery. 


To 
examine 
factors 
that 
might 
be 
associated 
with 
a 
high 
preoperative 
AHI, 
sex, 
age, 
BMI, 
tonsillar 
size, 
and 
caregiver 
report 
of 
preoperative 
symptoms 
were 
used 
as 
covariates 
for 
ANOVA. 
Only 
tonsillar 
size 
was 
correlated 
significantly 
with 
a 
high 
preoperative 
AHI. 
Children 
with 
OSA 
who 
had 
small 
tonsils 
(grade 
1–2) 
had 
a 
significantly 
lower 
mean 
preoperative 
AHI 
(P 
. 
.0001) 
than 
children 
with 
large 
tonsils 
(grade 
3–4).20 
There 
was 
no 
significant 
difference 
postoperatively 
in 
the 
AHI 
between 
the 
small 
and 
large 
tonsil 
groups 
(Table 
III). 


When 
children 
were 
divided 
into 
three

groups 
(3 
. 
6 
yr; 
6 
.

the 
improvement 
after 
adenotonsillectomy, 
as 
measured 
by 
changes 
in 
the 
AHI, 
was 
significant 
for 
each 
group. 
However, 
there 
was 
no 
significant 
difference 
in 
preoperative 
or

values 
between 
groups 
(Table

of 
the 
children 
whose 
caregivers 
reported 
an

score 
less

had 
persistent

Based 
on 
the 
results 
of 
this 
study, 
an 
algorithm 
for 
the 
management 
of 
healthy 
children 
with 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy 
and 
OSA 
is 
proposed 
in 
Figure 
2. 
Children 
should 
be 
followed 
up 
3 
months 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA. 
A 
detailed 
history 
obtained 
from 
the 
caregiver 
should 
be 
directed 
at 
identifying 
children 
with 
a 
persistent 
sleep 
disturbance. 
The 
majority 
of 
children 
(78%) 
are 
asymptomatic 
and 
can 
be 
discharged 
from 
the 
clinic. 
Further 
follow-up 
is 
required 
if 
symptoms 
recur. 
In 
children 
with 
persistent 
symptoms 
(22%), 
a 
complete 
head 
and 
neck 
examination 
is 
required. 
This 
should 
include 
craniofacial, 
nasal, 
and 
flexible 
laryngopharyngoscopy. 
Children 
should 
be 
routinely 
started 
on 
a 
nasal 
steroid 
spray 
and 
saline 
to 
maximize 
nasal 
airflow. 
Polysomnography 
should 
be 
requested 
in 
children 
with 
persistent 
symptoms. 
Children 
with 
no 
evidence 
of 
OSA 
on 
postoperative 
polysomnography 
(5%) 
should 
be 
observed 
with 
no 
further 
intervention. 
Children 
with 
persistent 
OSA 
on 
postoperative 
polysomnography 
(17%) 
should 
be 
managed 
on 
an 
individual 
basis. 
Allergy 
or 
orthodontic 
evaluation, 
continuous 
positive 
airway 
pressure, 
or 
other 
pharyngolaryngeal 
surgery 
may 
be 
appropriate.

DISCUSSION 


This 
report 
on 
the 
outcome 
of 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA 
presents 
data 
on 
the 
largest 
cohort 
of 
children 
studied 
to 
date 
using 
the 
change 
between 
pre-and 
postoperative 
polysomnography 
as 
the 
principal 
outcome 
measure. 
Obese 
children 
and 
children 
with 
Down 
syndrome 
or 
other 
genetic 
disorders 
that 
affect 
the 
craniofacial 
anatomy 
were 
excluded 
from 
the 
study. 
The 
rate 
of 
persistent 
OSA 
after 
surgery 
is 
known 
be 
higher 
in 
these 
children,12,17 
and 
their 
exclusion 
reduced 
the 
effects 
of 
covariates. 


In 
this 
study, 
the 
only 
predictor 
of 
a 
high 
preoperative 
AHI 
was 
large 
tonsillar 
size. 
This 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
findings 
of 
previous 
studies.4,16 
Suen 
et 
al.4 
reported 
that 
children 
with 
a 
respiratory 
disturbance 
index 
equal 
to 
or 
greater 
than 
5 
had 
significantly 
larger 
tonsils 
than 
children 
with 
a 
respiratory 
disturbance 
index 
less 
than 
5. 
Equally, 
Nieminen 
et 
al.16 
reported 
that 
93% 
of 
children 
with 
OSA 
had 
large 
tonsils 
compared 
with 
68% 
with 
primary 
snoring 
and 
only 
3% 
of 
controls. 
Surprisingly, 
a 
high 
preoperative 
OSA-18 
score 
was 
a 
poor 
indicator 
of 
the 
severity 
of 
OSA 
in 
children 
in 
this 
study. 
However, 
several 
previous 
investigations 
have 
indicated 
that 
clinical 
evaluation 
is 
poor 
at 
predicting 
the 
presence 
or 
severity 
of 


OSA.4,22–25 


All 
79 
children 
with 
OSA 
in 
the 
present 
study 
showed 
a 
marked 
improvement 
in 
the 
AHI 
after 
surgery. 
Improvements 
in 
the 
minimum 
oxygen 
saturation 
and 
in 
the 
arousal 
index 
also 
occurred 
after 
adenotonsillectomy. 
Previous 
studies4,16 
have 
shown 
similar 
results 
but 
in 
much 
smaller 
populations 
and 
with 
somewhat 
different 
inclusion 
criteria. 


Although 
children 
with 
OSA 
showed 
significant 
improvement 
in 
respiratory 
parameters 
after 
surgery, 
some 
children 
had 
persistent 
OSA. 
The 
number 
of 
children 
with 


persistent 
OSA 
varied 
by 
both 
the 
criterion 
and 
the 
threshold 
chosen 
for 
reporting 
the 
finding. 
Previous 
studies 
have 
used 
the 
following 
criteria: 
a 
respiratory 
disturbance 
index 
equal 
to 
or 
greater 
than 
126 
or 
equal 
to 
or 
greater 
than 
5;4,27,28 
an 
AHI 
equal 
to 
or 
greater 
than 
216 
or 
equal 
to 
or 
greater 
than 
5;15,29 
or 
an 
obstructive 
apnea 
index 
equal 
to 
or 
greater 
than 
1.30 
In 
the 
present 
research, 
it 
was 
possible 
to 
analyze 
outcome 
data 
from 
polysomnography 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
a 
variety 
of 
diagnostic 
criteria 
for 
OSA 
because 
the 
population 
of 
children 
studied 
was 
relatively 
large. 
The 
percentage 
of 
children 
with 
persistent 
OSA 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
was 
16% 
if 
an 
AHI 
equal 
to 
or 
greater 
than 
5 
was 
used 
to 
define 
OSA. 
However, 
if 
a 
more 
inclusive 
criterion 
such 
as 
a 
respiratory 
disturbance 
index 
equal 
to 
or 
greater 
than 
1 
was 
used 
to 
define 
the 
disorder, 
then 
27% 
of 
the 
children 
had 
persistent 
OSA 
after 
adenotonsillectomy. 
Even 
though 
OSA 
resolved 
in 
the 
overwhelming 
majority 
of 
children 
after 
adenotonsillectomy, 
identifying 
and 
treating 
children 
with 
persistent 
OSA 
remains 
a 
challenge. 


Despite 
published 
guidelines 
for 
the 
use 
of 
polysomnography 
to 
diagnose 
OSA 
in 
children,1 
only 
limited 
data 
are 
available 
about 
normal 
respiratory 
values 
during 
sleep 
in 
healthy 
children. 
Marcus 
et 
al.13 
reported 
on 
50 
children 
1 
to 
17 
years 
old 
and 
showed 
that 
obstructive 
apneas 
were 
uncommon 
in 
healthy 
children. 
Only 
9 
of 
50 
(18%) 
children 
had 
apneas, 
and 
most 
had 
one 
to 
two 
apneas 
per 
night. 
Marcus 
et 
al.13 
recommended 
an 
apnea 
index 
equal 
to 
or 
less 
than 
1 
as 
the 
upper 
limit 
of 
normal. 
In 
contrast, 
central 
apneas 
were 
common 
in 
the 
children 
studied. 
The 
majority 
of 
obstructive 
events 
were 
caused 
by 
partial 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
or 
hypopneas, 
but 
these 
were 
not 
included 
because 
no 
standard 
definition 
for 
hypopneas 
existed 
at 
the 
time.

using

showed 
that 
even 
these

were 
uncommon 
and 
that 
the

significant 
upper

1.5.31 
Uliel 
et 
al.32 
confirmed 
these 
findings 
in 
70 
healthy 
children 
aged 
1 
to 
15 
years. 
In 
effect, 
82% 
of 
all 
apneas 
in 
their 
study 
were 
secondary 
to 
central 
apneas, 
as 
were 
the 
majority 
of 
significant 
oxygen 
desaturations. 
Traeger 
et 
al.33 
reported 
data 
from 
polysomnography 
in 
a 
cohort 
of 
66 
healthy 
children 
aged 
2 
to 
9 
years, 
the 
age 
range 
in 
which 
OSA 
most 
commonly 
occurs 
in 
children.

They 
showed 
that 
respiratory 
events 
such 
as 
obstructive 
hypopneas, 
obstructive 
apneas, 
and 
central 
apneas 
were 
rare 
in 
normal 
children. 
When 
these 
events 
occurred, 
obstructive 
hypopneas 
were 
the 
most 
common 
(77%) 
followed 
by 
central 
apnea 
(21%) 
and 
obstructive 
apneas 
(2%). 
The 
lowest 
oxygen 
desaturation 
measured 
in 
their 
study 
was 
81% 
and 
was 
associated 
with 
a 
central 
apnea. 
They 
noted 
that 
older 
children 
(8 
yr 
of 
age) 
had 
less 
sleep 
efficiency, 
less 
REM 
sleep, 
and 
fewer 
central 
apneas. 
Goh 
et 
al.34 
studied 
healthy 
children 
aged 
2 
to 
12 
years 
using 
polysomnography 
and 
showed 
that 
OSA 
was 
predominantly 
a 
disorder 
of 
REM 
sleep 
that 
progressed 
over 
the 
course 
of 
the 
night. 
These 
previous 
studies 
have 
added 
significantly 
to 
our 
knowledge 
of 
normal 
sleep 
parameters 
in 
children. 
However, 
only 
limited 
information 
is 
available 
about 
the 
effects 
of 
age, 
sex, 
BMI, 
and 
ethnicity 
on 
normal 
sleep 
as 
measured 
by 
polysomnography. 


There 
is 
even 
more 
limited 
information 
about 
the 
correlation 
between 
objective 
respiratory 
parameters, 
child 
behavior, 
and 
quality 
of 
life. 
OSA 
is 
known 
to 
be 


associated 
with 
behavioral 
problems 
in 
children.6,7,11 
It 
is 
also 
known 
to 
lead 
to 
poor 
quality 
of 
life 
in 
children.35 
Several 
studies 
have 
assessed 
the 
relationship 
between 
the 
severity 
of 
OSA, 
as 
measured 
by 
polysomnography, 
and 
behavioral 
and 
quality 
of 
life 
scores 
in 
children.36–38 
Kaemingk 
et 
al.36 
showed 
that 
children 
with 
an 
AHI 
equal 
to 
or 
greater 
than 
5 
had 
more 
difficulties 
with 
learning 
and 
memory 
than 
children 
with 
an 
AHI 
less 
than 
5. 
However, 
Owens 
et 
al.39 
and 
Friedman 
et 
al.40 
failed 
to 
show 
a 
significant 
positive 
correlation 
between 
behavioral 
problems 
and 
the 
severity 
of 
OSA 
as 
measured 
by 
polysomnography. 
Likewise, 
Mitchell 
et 
al.8 
showed 
a 
poor 
correlation 
between 
the 
severity 
of 
OSA 
as 
measured 
by 
polysomnography 
and 
total 
OSA-18 
scores 
on 
the 
quality 
of 
life 
survey. 
Furthermore, 
Mitchell 
et 
al.41 
reported 
similar 
improvements 
in 
quality 
of 
life 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA 
regardless 
of 
whether 
children 
had 
OSA 
or 
milder 
forms 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing. 
However, 
none 
of 
these 
previous 
studies 
correlated 
improvements 
in 
polysomnography 
with 
improvements 
in 
behavior 
and 
quality 
of 
life 
after 
adenotonsillectomy. 


Postoperative 
AHI 
values 
had 
a 
poor 
correlation 
with 
the 
postoperative 
total 
OSA-18 
scores. 
The 
explanation 
for 
this 
observation 
remains 
uncertain. 
Several 
factors 
may 
account 
for 
the 
absence 
of 
a 
correlation 
between 
postoperative 
data 
from 
polysomnography 
and 
postoperative 
OSA-18 
scores.

objective 
test

It 
is 
therefore 
not 
surprising 
that 
the 
same 
pattern 
is 
seen 
postoperatively. 
Furthermore, 
we 
used 
the 
AHI 
as 
a 
single 
objective 
measure 
of 
OSA 
severity. 
It 
is 
possible 
that 
postoperative 
quality 
of 
life 
more 
closely 
correlates 
to 
other 
postoperative 
sleep 
parameters, 
such 
as 
the 
arousal 
index 
or 
the 
number 
and 
severity 
of 
oxygen 
desaturations 
as 
measured 
by 
polysomnography. 


To 
assess 
the 
importance 
of 
age 
on 
the 
outcome 
of 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA, 
children 
in 
the 
study 
population 
were 
divided 
into 
three 
groups 
for 
analysis: 
3 
to 
6 
year 
olds; 
6 
to 
12 
year 
olds; 
and 
12 
to 
18 
year 
olds. 
No 
significant 
difference 
was 
found 
in 
the 
preoperative 
AHI 
in 
children 
from 
these 
different 
age 
groups. 
The 
majority 
of 
children 
(62%) 
in 
the 
study 
were 
younger 
than 
6, 
and 
only 
8% 
were 
older 
than 
12. 
Indeed, 
none 
of 
the 
children 
was 
over 
16. 
This 
reflects 
the 
peak 
incidence 
of 
OSA 
in 
the 
4 
to 
6 
year 
age 
group.2 
However, 
despite 
the 
relatively 
large 
overall 
study 
population, 
the 
absence 
of 
differences 
between 
age 
groups 
may 
simply 
be 
a 
reflection 
of 
the 
small 
number 
of 
older 
children 
with 
OSA 
included 
in 
this 
study. 


The 
present 
study 
demonstrates 
that 
a 
high 
preoperative 
AHI 
is 
associated 
with 
persistence 
of 
OSA 
postoperatively. 
None 
of 
the 
children 
with 
a 
preoperative 
AHI 
less 
than 
10 
had 
persistent 
OSA 
postoperatively. 
Only 
3 
of 
43 
(7%) 
children 
with 
a 
preoperative 
AHI 
less 
than 
20 
had 


persistent 
OSA. 
In 
contrast, 
13 
of 
36 
(36%) 
children 
with 
a 
preoperative 
AHI 
greater 
than 
20 
had 
persistent 
OSA 
after 
surgery. 
This 
confirms 
the 
previous 
results 
of 
Suen 
et 
al.,4 
who 
studied 
26 
children 
with 
OSA 
and 
showed 
that 
a 
preoperative 
value 
of 
the 
respiratory 
disturbance 
index 
equal 
to 
or 
less 
than 
19 
predicts 
a 
postoperative 
value 
less 
than 
5. 
Mitchell 
et 
al.27 
studied 
29 
children 
with 
severe 
OSA, 
defined 
as 
a 
respiratory 
disturbance 
index 
equal 
to 
or 
greater 
than 
30, 
and 
showed 
that 
the 
majority 
(69%) 
had 
a 
respiratory 
disturbance 
index 
equal 
to 
or 
greater 
than 
5 
postoperatively. 
Clearly, 
children 
with 
severe 
OSA 
are 
less 
likely 
to 
experience 
resolution 
of 
their 
sleep 
disorder 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
and 
require 
more 
careful 
follow-up. 


Caregiver 
reports 
of 
postoperative 
symptoms 
of 
snoring 
or 
sleep 
disturbance 
correlate 
well 
with 
persistence 
of 
OSA 
after 
adenotonsillectomy. 
Of 
the 
79 
children 
in 
this 
study, 
the 
caregivers 
of 
22 
reported 
snoring 
some, 
most, 
or 
all 
of 
the 
time 
after 
surgery. 
All 
children 
with 
a 
persistently 
high 
AHI 
continued 
to 
snore, 
although 
eight 
children 
with 
an 
AHI 
that 
normalized 
continued 
to 
snore. 
As 
shown 
in 
Table 
VII, 
the 
absence 
of 
postoperative 
snoring 
was 
associated 
with 
no 
treatment

whereas 
a

59%). 
When 
caregivers 
were 
asked 
to 
quantify 
their 
child’s 
sleep 
disturbance 
using 
the 
OSA-18 
sleep 
domain,21 
a 
score 
of 
more 
than 
20 
resulted 
in 
an 
NPV 
of 
100% 
and 
a 
PPV 
of 
76%. 
Furthermore, 
both 
Suen 
et 
al.4 
and 
Nieminen 
et 
al.16 
reported 
that 
none 
of 
the 
children 
who 
stopped 
snoring 
had 
persistence 
of 
OSA. 
Thus, 
although 
preoperative 
symptoms 
are 
poor 
at 
predicting 
the 
presence 
and 
severity 
of 
OSA, 
postoperative 
symptoms 
are 
very 
good 
indicators 
of 
the 
persistence 
of 
OSA 
after 
adenotonsillectomy. 


Previous 
studies 
have 
reported 
that 
otolaryngologists 
rarely 
request 
polysomnography 
prior 
to 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA 
in 
children.42,43 
In 
contrast, 
both 
the 
American 
Academy 
of 
Pediatrics12 
and 
the 
American 
Thoracic 
Society1 
recommend 
that 
polysomnography 
be 
used 
to 
evaluate 
OSA 
prior 
to 
surgical 
therapy. 
A 
major 
limitation 
of 
previous 
studies 
on 
outcome 
of 
surgical 
therapy 
for 
OSA 
in 
children 
has 
been 
the 
cost 
of 
polysomnography. 
Suen 
et 
al.4 
reported 
a 
cost-benefit 
analysis 
of 
performing 
polysomnography 
in 
all 
children 
referred 
with 
a 
sleep 
disturbance. 
They 
reported 
that 
only 
50% 
of 
children 
referred 
for 
polysomnography 
in 
their 
study 
had 
OSA 
and 
underwent 
an 
adenotonsillectomy. 
Because 
the 
cost 
of 
surgical 
therapy 
was 
$5,000 
as 
compared 
with 
$1,100 
for 
polysomnography, 
they 
concluded 
that 
preoperative 
testing 
of 
all 
children 
is 
cost 
effective. 
However, 
Suen 
et 
al.4 
have 
used 
an 
AHI 
greater 
or 
equal 
to 
5 
as 
the 
definition 
of 
OSA, 
and 
this 
may 
be 
too 
conservative. 
Equally, 
they 
did 
not 
address 
the 
management 
of 
symptomatic 
children 
with 
negative 
polysomnography. 
At 
present, 
the 
cost, 
availability, 
and 
preferences 
of 
the 
physician 
and 
family 
are 
the 
major 
factors 
in 
deciding 
who 
has 
preoperative 
polysomnography.
43 
However, 
polysomnography 
remains 
an 
objective 
test 
that 
is 
the 
gold 
standard 
for 
diagnosing 
OSA. 
Clinical 
diagnosis, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
is 
known 
to 
be 
an 
inaccurate 
method 
for 
diagnosing 
OSA.22–25 
Data 
from 
polysomnography 
have 
also 
been 
used 
to 
predict 
the 
risk 
of 
postoperative 
respiratory 
compromise 
and 
to 
identify 
children 
who 
would 
benefit 
from 
a 
planned 
inpatient 
stay 
after 
adenotonsillectomy.44 


The 
strength 
of 
this 
study 
is 
the 
inclusion 
of 
a 
relatively 
large 
population 
of 
healthy 
children 
with 
OSA 
using 
data 
from 
both 
pre-and 
postoperative 
polysomnography 
as 
well 
as 
information 
about 
patient 
demographics 
and 
quality 
of 
life. 
However, 
the 
study 
has 
a 
number 
of 
limitations. 
First, 
a 
prospective, 
randomized 
design 
comparing 
a 
treatment 
with 
a 
nontreatment 
group 
was 
not 
used.1 
Therefore, 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
conclude 
that 
adenotonsillectomy 
causes 
resolution 
of 
OSA. 
The 
changes 
observed 
in 
sleep 
parameters 
after 
surgery 
may 
to 
some 
extent 
reflect 
the 
natural 
resolution 
of 
OSA 
over 
time. 
Second, 
children 
underwent 
a 
single 
preoperative 
and 
a 
single 
postoperative 
sleep 
study. 
Clinically 
significant 
variability 
in 
polysomnography 
from 
night 
to 
night 
may 
account 
for 
some 
of 
the 
improvement 
after 
surgical 
therapy. 
However, 
previous 
studies 
have 
shown 
that 
such 
variability 
is 
low.45,46 
Indeed, 
Li 
et 
al.45 
reported 
a 
significant 
improvement 
in 
respiratory 
parameters 
on 
the 
second 
night 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA. 
Nonetheless, 
these 
changes 
were 
much 
smaller 
than 
those 
seen 
the 
first 
night 
after 
sur


gery 
and 
were 
likely 
to 
be 
secondary 
to 
the 
resolution 
of 
OSA 
over 
time. 
They 
were 
not 
sufficient 
to 
recommend 
routine 
second-night 
sleep 
studies.45 
Third, 
despite 
the 
relatively 
large 
study 
population, 
there 
were 
too 
few 
children 
to 
study 
outcomes 
after 
surgery 
as 
a 
function 
of 
different 
age 
groups, 
sex, 
and 
ethnicity. 
Fourth, 
the 
follow-up 
after 
surgery 
was 
short 
and 
did 
not 
provide 
data 
on 
the 
recurrence 
of 
OSA 
over 
a 
period 
of 
several 
years. 


The 
risks 
of 
untreated 
OSA 
in 
children 
remain 
unknown. 
Earlier 
reports 
have 
suggested 
poor 
growth, 
pulmonary 
hypertension, 
and 
cor 
pulmonale 
as 
complications 
of 
children 
with 
untreated 
severe 
OSA.12 
Ng 
et 
al.,47 
in 
a 
review 
of 
10 
studies, 
concluded 
that 
there 
is 
increasing 
evidence 
that 
OSA 
is 
associated 
with 
detectable 
cardiovascular 
abnormalities 
in 
children. 
However, 
the 
increasing 
recognition 
of 
the 
association 
between 
OSA 
and 
daytime 
behavioral 
problems 
in 
children 
is 
likely 
to 
have 
lead 
to 
earlier 
surgical 
treatment 
of 
OSA 
with 
fewer 
cases 
of 
late 
cardiac 
complications. 
Furthermore, 
risks 
of 
untreated 
behavioral 
problems 
are 
difficult 
to 
measure 
or 
quantify. 
These 
potential 
risks 
of 
untreated 
OSA 
need 
to 
be 
considered 
against 
the 
risks 
of 
surgical 
therapy. 
Post-
tonsillectomy 
hemorrhage 
remains 
the 
most 
serious 
complication 
of 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA 
and 
can 
occur 
in 
up 
to 
3% 
of 
children. 
Other 
complications 
such 
as 
admission 
for 
dehydration, 
nausea, 
and 
vomiting 
are 
less 
common, 
and 
catastrophic 
anesthetic 
and 
bleeding 
complications 
are 
rare.48 


The 
present 
study 
shows 
that 
10% 
to 
20% 
of 
healthy 
children 
have 
persistent 
OSA 
after 
adenotonsillectomy, 
and 
the 
majority 
of 
these 
children 
have 
severe 
OSA 
pre-
operatively. 
More 
importantly, 
all 
children 
with 
persistent 
OSA 
are 
symptomatic 
postoperatively. 
It 
is 
therefore 
important, 
especially 
in 
children 
without 
preoperative 
polysomnography, 
to 
inquire 
about 
a 
persistent 
sleep 
disturbance. 
Polysomnography 
in 
children 
with 
postoperative 
symptoms 
of 
sleep 
disturbance 
may 
well 
identify 
persistent 
OSA 
that 
requires 
further 
treatment. 
Persistent 
OSA 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
may 
be 
caused 
by 
a 
number 
of 
factors. 
Nasal 
obstruction 
caused 
by 
allergic 
disease, 
septal 
deviation, 
or 
enlarged 
inferior 
turbinates 
should 
be 
detected 
and 
treated. 
Abnormalities 
of 
the 
palate, 
base 
of 
tongue, 
or 
supraglottal 
collapse 
or 
obstruction 
can 
be 
diagnosed 
using 
flexible 
fiberoptic 
endoscopy 
(Fig. 
2). 
The 
diagnosis 
and 
treatment 
of 
children 
with 
persistent 
OSA 
is 
beyond 
the 
scope 
of 
this 
study. 


Children 
with 
mild 
preoperative 
OSA 
or 
mild 
persistent 
postoperative 
OSA 
may 
be 
considered 
for 
medical 
treatment 
prior 
to 
surgical 
intervention. 
Nasal 
steroids 
and 
leukotriene 
inhibitors 
have 
been 
shown 
to 
be 
associated 
with 
a 
significant 
improvement 
in 
upper 
airway 
patency 
and 
a 
reduction 
in 
severity 
of 
OSA.49 
Antimicrobial 
therapy 
may 
be 
effective 
in 
temporarily 
improving 
OSA 
by 
reducing 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy 
but 
do 
not 
obviate 
the 
need 
for 
surgery.50 
The 
role 
of 
antihistamines, 
treatment 
of 
gastroesophageal 
reflux 
disease, 
or 
weight 
reduction 
in 
overweight 
children 
is 
unknown.

CONCLUSIONS 


Implications 
for 
Clinical 
Practice 


1. 
Adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA 
results 
in 
a 
dramatic 
improvement 
in 
respiratory 
parameters 
as 
measured 
by 
polysomnography 
in 
the 
majority 
of 
healthy, 
nonobese 
children. 
2. 
Quality 
of 
life, 
as 
measured 
by 
the 
OSA-18 
survey, 
also 
improves 
dramatically 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA 
in 
children. 
This 
improvement 
applies 
to 
all 
domains 
of 
the 
OSA-18 
survey. 
3. 
The 
correlation 
between 
improvements 
in 
respiratory 
parameters 
and 
improvements 
in 
quality 
of 
life 
is 
poor. 
4. 
Large 
tonsillar 
size 
is 
the 
only 
factor 
that 
correlated 
with 
the 
severity 
of 
OSA 
in 
children. 
Preoperative 
reports 
of 
symptoms 
such 
as 
snoring 
and 
witnessed 
apneas, 
the 
age 
of 
the 
child, 
and 
the 
child’s 
sex 
and 
ethnicity 
did 
not 
correlate 
with 
abnormal 
respiratory 
parameters 
measured 
by 
polysomnography. 
5. 
The 
severity 
of 
preoperative 
OSA 
and 
postoperative 
reports 
of 
symptoms 
such 
as 
snoring 
and 
witnessed 
apneas 
are 
good 
indicators 
of 
the 
likelihood 
of 
persistence 
of 
OSA 
after 
adenotonsillectomy. 
6. 
Whenever 
possible, 
before 
undertaking 
surgical 
therapy, 
OSA 
should 
be 
measured 
objectively 
with 
polysomnography 
rather 
than 
subjectively 
by 
caregiver 
reports 
of 
symptoms. 
Implications 
for 
Research 


1. 
Randomized, 
controlled 
studies 
are 
necessary 
to 
establish 
a 
causal 
relationship 
between 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA 
and 
resolution 
of 
the 
disorder 
after 
surgery 
as 
measured 
by 
polysomnography. 
Some 
of 
the 
ethical 
considerations 
in 
establishing 
a 
control 
group 
may 
be 
overcome 
by 
offering 
the 
“nonsurgical” 
group 
medical 
treatment 
such 
as 
nasal 
steroid 
sprays 
or 
leukotriene 
inhibitors. 
Limiting 
the 
study 
to 
children 
with 
mild 
OSA 
and 
offering 
expedited 
surgical 
therapy 
to 
children 
who 
fail 
medical 
therapy 
may 
also 
help 
to 
overcome 
some 
of 
these 
difficulties. 
2. 
Normative 
data 
on 
sleep 
parameters 
in 
healthy 
children 
are 
needed. 
These 
data 
should 
include 
a 
large 
sample 
of 
children 
of 
different 
age 
groups 
and 
ethnicity. 
3. 
Changes 
in 
quality 
of 
life 
and 
behavior 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA 
in 
children 
should 
be 
studied 
using 
a 
multidimensional 
approach 
that 
involves 
objective 
measurement 
of 
respiratory 
parameters 
with 
polysomnography, 
direct 
observation 
of 
behavior 
by 
psychologists, 
and 
proxy 
measurement 
of 
quality 
of 
life 
by 
caregivers. 
4. 
Better 
indicators 
of 
persistent 
OSA 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
in 
children 
should 
be 
identified. 
Quality 
of 
life 
instruments 
and 
behavioral 
observation 
may 
have 
a 
role 
in 
identifying 
children 
who 
will 
develop 
persistent 
OSA, 
but 
an 
objective 
physiologic 
measure 
may 
be 
more 
practical 
and 
consistent. 
5. 
The 
natural 
history 
of 
persistent 
OSA 
in 
children 
needs 
further 
study. 
Long-term 
data 
are 
necessary 
to 
show 
whether 
children 
with 
OSA 
that 
persists 
in 
the 
first 
few 
months 
after 
surgery 
show 
improvements 
in 
sleep 
parameters 
over 
time 
and 
what 
effect 
this 
may 
have 
on 
quality 
of 
life 
and 
behavior. 


6. 
Further 
research 
should 
also 
be 
undertaken 
to 
establish 
the 
mechanism 
of 
the 
airway 
obstruction 
that 
causes 
OSA. 
Polysomnography 
is 
used 
to 
diagnose 
the 
sleep 
disturbance 
not 
to 
identify 
the 
root 
cause 
of 
apnea 
or 
hypopnea 
during 
sleep. 
Therefore, 
the 
development 
of 
methods 
to 
prevent 
these 
incidents 
may 
require 
direct 
measurement 
of 
the 
occlusive 
event, 
including 
changes 
in 
the 
dimensions 
of 
the 
airway 
and 
in 
the 
reflex 
tone 
of 
pharyngeal 
musculature. 
Improvements 
in 
surgery 
directed 
at 
the 
site 
of 
obstruction 
may 
result 
from 
deeper 
understanding 
of 
the 
physiologic 
mechanism 
of 
obstruction.
