Aims: 
(1) To determine the extent to which tonsil size contributes to the severity of obstructive sleep 
apnoea (OSA) in children; and (2) to assess the use of tonsillar-pharyngeal (TP) ratio in differentiating 
patients with different severity of OSA. 
Methods: 
Lateral neck radiograph was performed on 35 children referred consecutively to a university 
paediatric chest clinic for suspected OSA secondary to tonsillar hypertrophy. The tonsil size was 
determined by measuring the TP ratio on the radiographs. The severity of OSA was assessed by over-

bstructive 
sleep 
apnoea 
syndrome 
(OSAS) 
in 
children 
is 
characterised 
by 
recurrent 
events 
of 
partial 
or 
complete 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
during 
sleep, 
resulting 
in 
disruption 
of 
normal 
ventilation 
and 
sleep 
patterns.1 
The 
condition 
is 
increasingly 
being 
recognised 
and 
studies 
have 
found 
the 
prevalence 
to 
be 
around 
2–4% 
among 
the 
paediatric 
population.23 
Many 
causes 
have 
been 
found 
to 
lead 
to 
OSAS, 
but 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy 
remains 
the 
most 
common.45 


Children 
with 
OSAS 
have 
larger 
tonsils 
on 
clinical 
inspection 
than 
do 
children 
without 
OSAS,6 
and 
adenotonsillectomy 
has 
resulted 
in 
improvement 
in 
symptoms, 
polysomnographic 
readings,7 
and 
remission 
of 
serious 
sequelae 
such 
as 
cor 
pulmonale.8 
Previous 
studies, 
however, 
have 
failed 
to 
establish 
any 
relation 
between 
tonsil 
size 
assessed 
by 
direct 
inspection 
and 
severity 
of 
OSAS 
in 
children.9–11 


The 
gold 
standard 
for 
the 
diagnosis 
of 
OSAS 
is 
polysomnography 
(PSG) 
performed 
in 
a 
sleep 
laboratory. 
It 
is 
an 
expensive 
system 
to 
operate 
and 
very 
time 
and 
labour 
intensive. 
In 
many 
units, 
limited 
access 
to 
equipment 
resources 
has 
resulted 
in 
long 
waiting 
times 
for 
PSG 
assessments. 
Various 
less 
resource 
demanding 
screening 
methods 
have 
been 
proposed, 
including 
home 
video 
recording, 
nap 
study, 
and 
pulse 
oximetry. 
Although 
these 
methods 
were 
found 
to 
be 
sensitive 
in 
detecting 
for 
OSAS, 
they 
were 
unable 
to 
differentiate 
between 
the 
varying 
degrees 
of 
severity 
of 
the 
condition.12 


In 
this 
study, 
we 
measured 
the 
tonsillar-pharyngeal 
(TP) 
ratio 
on 
standard 
lateral 
neck 
radiograph 
and 
performed 
overnight 
PSG 
in 
35 
children 
with 
suspected 
OSAS. 
The 
relation 
between 
the 
two 
modalities 
of 
investigation 
was 
examined. 
The 
feasibility 
of 
using 
TP 
ratio 
in 
differentiating 
paediatric 
patients 
with 
different 
severities 
of 
OSAS 
was 
also 
assessed. 


METHODS 
Subjects 


A 
total 
of 
35 
consecutive 
patients, 
referred 
to 
our 
paediatric 
chest 
clinic 
because 
of 
suspected 
OSAS, 
were 
recruited 
in 
the 


study. 
Children 
with 
a 
known 
syndromic 
diagnosis, 
chronic 
lung 
disease, 
or 
neurological 
or 
craniofacial 
abnormalities 
were 
excluded. 
Children 
enrolled 
underwent 
physical 
examination, 
standard 
lateral 
neck 
radiograph, 
and 
overnight 
polysomnography 
(PSG) 
after 
informed 
consent 
was 
obtained 
from 
the 
parents. 


Method 


The 
clinical 
history 
of 
each 
child 
was 
obtained 
from 
the 
parent; 
the 
following 
information 
related 
to 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnoea 
(OSA) 
was 
obtained 
using 
a 
standardised 
questionnaire: 
(1) 
night-time 
symptoms, 
which 
included 
loudness 
and 
frequency 
of 
snoring, 
difficulty 
in 
breathing, 
observed 
apnoea 
during 
sleep, 
necessity 
for 
parents 
to 
shake 
the 
child 
to 
breathe, 
restless 
sleep, 
varying 
sleep 
posture, 
enuresis, 
and 
night 
sweating; 
(2) 
daytime 
symptoms 
which 
included 
excessive 
daytime 
sleepiness, 
behavioural 
problems, 
morning 
headache, 
and 
mouth 
breathing. 
The 
loudness 
of 
snoring 
was 
assessed 
as 
just 
audible, 
clearly 
heard 
in 
the 
same 
room, 
clearly 
heard 
outside 
the 
room, 
and 
clearly 
heard 
in 
another 
room. 
The 
frequency 
of 
snoring 
was 
defined 
as 
never, 
rarely, 
1–4 
times 
a 
month, 
more 
than 
once 
a 
week 
and 
every 
night. 
Other 
symptoms 
were 
assessed 
as 
being 
present 
or 
absent. 


A 
complete 
physical 
examination 
was 
carried 
out 
on 
each 
child 
to 
assess 
his 
or 
her 
physical 
state, 
especially 
growth 
parameters 
(height 
and 
weight), 
tonsil 
size, 
and 
signs 
of 
pulmonary 
hypertension 
or 
cor 
pulmonale. 
Tonsil 
size 
was 
graded 
using 
a 
point 
scale 
as 
follows: 
0, 
no 
enlargement; 
1, 
slight 
enlargement 
with 
the 
transverse 
air 
slit 
more 
than 
half

Chest 
radiograph 
and 
electrocardiogram 
were 
performed 
on 
each 
child 
for 
evidence 
of 
cor 
pulmonale. 


An 
overnight 
polysomnography 
(PSG) 
was 
performed 
on 
each 
child 
using 
a 
16 
channel 
recorder 
(Oxford 
Medilog 
MPA-S, 
Oxford 
Instruments 
Ltd, 
Oxford, 
UK). 
In 
each 
PSG 
study 
the 
stage 
of 
sleep 
was 
assessed 
by 
electroencephalogram, 
bilateral 
electro-oculogram, 
and 
submental 
electromyogram; 
chest 
wall 
and 
abdominal 
movements 
were 
measured 
by 
respiratory 
impendence 
plethysmography; 
airflow 
through 
the 
nose 
was 
measured 
with 
a 
thermister; 
oxygen 
saturation 
was 
measured 
by 
pulse 
oximetry; 
and 
body 
motions 
were 
recorded 
by 
a 
body 
position 
sensor. 


Sleep 
stage 
was 
scored 
by 
trained 
personnel 
and 
the 
standard 
criteria 
were 
followed.14 
An 
obstructive 
event 
was 
defined 
as 
cessation 
of 
airflow 
with 
increase 
in 
irregular 
respiratory 
and 
abdominal 
movement 
for 
more 
than 
two 
consecutive 
breaths. 
Central 
apnoea 
was 
defined 
as 
cessation 
of 
breathing 
with 
no 
respiratory 
effort 
for 
more 
than 
10 
seconds. 
Apnoeic 
episodes 
with 
features 
of 
both 
obstructive 
and 
central 
events 
were 
categorised 
as 
mixed 
apnoeas. 
Hypopnoea 
was 
defined 
as 
a 
reduction 
in 
oronasal 
flow 
by 
more 
than 
50% 
associated 
with 
arousals 
and/or 
desaturations. 
Apnoea–hypopnoea 
index 
(AHI) 
was 
defined 
as 
the 
total 
number 
of 
apnoeic 
and 
hypopnoeic 
episodes 
per 
hour. 
The 
number 
of 
episodes 
of 
oxygen 
desaturation 
by 
more 
than 
4% 
from 
baseline 
per 
hour 
was 
also 
noted 
(oxygen 
desaturation 
index). 


Lateral 
neck 
radiograph 


The 
lateral 
neck 
radiograph 
was 
performed 
using 
standard 
techniques 
with 
the 
patient’s 
neck 
extended.

The 
TP 
ratio 
(fig

was 
measured 
according 
to 
the 
method 
of 
Shintani 
and 
colleagues15 
by 
a 
single 
investigator 
(JK) 
who 
was 
blinded 
to 
the

clinical 
or 
polysomnographic 
findings. 


Statistical 
analysis 


The 
AHI, 
ODI, 
and 
TP 
ratio 
formed 
skewed 
distributions 
and 
were 
presented 
as 
median 
with 
interquartile 
range. 
Spearman’s 
rank 
correlation 
was 
used 
to 
assess 
the 
association 
between 
the 
ratio 
and 
the 
various 
OSA 
parameters. 
Comparisons 
of 
the 
ratios 
of 
mild 
versus 
moderately 
severe 
OSA 
subjects 
were 
made 
using 
Mann–Whitney 
test. 


A 
receiver 
operating 
characteristic 
curve 
(ROC)16 
analysis 
was 
used 
to 
assess 
the 
optimal 
cut 
off 
probability 
value 
for 
predicting 
cases 
with 
moderate/severe 
OSA 
using 
the 
TP 
ratio. 
An 
ROC 
curve 
is 
constructed 
by 
plotting 
the 
sensitivity 
versus 
1-specificity 
of 
the 
TP 
ratio 
for 
moderate/severe 
OSA, 
identified 
from 
multiple 
logistic 
regression. 
The 
area 
under 
the 
ROC 
curve 
estimated 
the 
probability 
of 
correctly 
predicting 
moderate/severe 
OSA, 
with 
an 
area 
of 
1.0 
as 
perfect 
prediction 
and 
an 
area 
of 
0.50 
being 
no 
better 
prediction 
than 
chance. 
An 
optimal 
prediction 
function 
should 
yield 
a 
high 
true 
positive 
rate 
(sensitivity) 
as 
well 
as 
a 
low 
false 
positive 
rate 
(high 
specificity). 
The 
choice 
of 
the 
critical 
cut 
off 
point, 
however, 
would 
vary 
with 
the 
perceived 
trade 
offs 
between 
sensitivity 
and 
specificity. 


Analyses 
were 
performed 
using 
SPSS 
for 
Windows 
(release 
10.1, 
SPSS 
Inc., 
Chicago, 
Illinois, 
USA). 
The 
level 
of 
significance 
was 
set 
at 
5% 
in 
all 
comparisons, 
and 
all 
statistical 
testing 
was 
two 
sided. 


RESULTS 


A

of 
24

All 
but 
three 
subjects 
had 
snoring 
every 
night 
and 
the 
snoring 
could 
at 
least 
be 
heard 
in 
the 
same 
room 
in 
34 
of 
the 
35 
subjects. 
Other 
common 
presenting 
night-time 
symptoms 
included 
restless 
sleep 
(69%), 
struggle 
to 
breathe 
during 
sleep 
(63%), 
increased 
night 
sweat 
(49%), 
and 
sleeping 
with 
the 
neck 
extended 
or 
in 
the 
prone 
position 
(49%). 
Ten 
children 
were 
found 
to 
have 
apnoeic 
episodes 
during 
sleep, 
but 
only 
three 
required 
stimulation 
to 
make 
them 
breathe 
again. 
Two 
children 
had 
secondary 
enuresis. 
The 
commonest 
daytime 
symptom 
was 
mouth 
breathing 
(74%). 
Daytime 
somnolence 
was 
a 
feature 
in 
seven 
children. 


All 
children 
had 
tonsillar 
hypertrophy 
on 
clinical 
inspection, 
with 
30 
of 
the 
35 
subjects 
having 
a 
tonsil 
size 
of 
grade 
2 
or 
above. 
None 
of 
the 
subjects 
had 
features 
of 
pulmonary 
hypertension 
or 
cor 
pulmonale 
on 
physical 
examination, 
chest 
radiograph, 
or 
electrocardiogram. 


As 
shown 
in 
table 
1, 
the 
median 
AHI 
was 
16.93 
(interquartile 
range 
8.41 
to 
28.29). 
The 
median 
ODI 
was 
8.63 
(interquartile 
range 
2.16 
to 
16.03). 
The 
median 
TP 
ratio 
was 


0.76 
(interquartile 
range 
0.65 
to 
0.8). 
All 
children 
slept 
well 
during 
the 
polysomnographic 
study, 
with 
an 
average 
sleep 
efficiency 
of 
87%. 
Central 
and 
mixed 
apnoeas 
were 
rare. 
A 
significant 
correlation 
was 
found 
between 
the 
TP 
ratio 
and 
the 
AHI 
and 
ODI 
(r 
= 
0.798, 
p 
< 
0.0001 
and 
r 
= 
0.505, 
p 
= 
0.002 
respectively). 
However, 
no 
correlation 
was 
found 
between 
the 
tonsil 
size 
assessed 
clinically 
with 
either 
the 
TP 
ratio 
or 
the 
various 
OSA 
parameters 
(table 
2). 


In 
a 
previous 
unpublished 
study, 
we 
were 
able 
to 
identify 
patients 
with 
mild 
OSA 
by 
using 
an 
AHI 
<10. 
This 
group 
of 
patients 
had 
minimal 
obstructive 
episodes 
and 
no 
desaturations 
documented 
on 
sleep 
nasendoscopy 
compared 
to 
those 
with 
an 
AHI 
>10. 
In 
the 
current 
study, 
24 
cases 
had 
an 
AHI 
>10 
(moderate/severe 
OSA) 
and 
11 
had 
an 
AHI 
<10 
(mild 
OSA). 
There 
was 
a 
significant 
difference 
between 
the 
TP 
ratios 
of 
the 
two 
groups 
(0.80 
versus 
0.60, 
p 
< 
0.0001). 
ROC 
curve 
analysis 
revealed 
that 
the 
optimal 
probability 
cut 
off 
for 
predicting 
moderate/severe 
OSA 
using 
TP 
ratio 
was 
0.479, 
with 
the 
area 
under 
the 
curve 
being 
0.973.

DISCUSSION 


OSAS 
is 
caused 
by 
a 
collapse 
of 
the 
upper 
airway 
during 
sleep 
when 
muscle 
tone 
of 
the 
upper 
respiratory 
tract 
decreases. 
It 
is 
therefore 
prone 
to 
occur 
in 
patients 
with 
narrowing 
of 
the 
upper 
airway. 
In 
the 
paediatric 
population, 
the 
commonest 
cause 
for 
this 
is 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy. 


In 
our 
study 
looking 
at 
children 
with 
OSAS 
secondary 
to 
tonsillar 
enlargement, 
we 
used 
the 
TP 
ratio 
measured 
on 
standard 
lateral 
neck 
radiograph 
as 
an 
indicator 
of 
the 
degree 
of 
tonsillar 
enlargement. 
We 
believe 
that 
this 
measurement 
is 
more 
reliable 
than 
visual 
assessment 
of 
tonsillar 
size 
in 
judging 
the 
pharyngeal 
patency. 
We 
found 
that 
there 
was 
a 
significant 
correlation 
between 
the 
TP 
ratio 
and 
the 
severity 
of 
OSAS. 
This 
result 
is 
the 
first 
to 
our 
knowledge, 
to 
suggest 
a 
significant 
positive 
relation 
between 
tonsillar 
enlargement 
and 
OSAS. 
Previous 
studies 
have 
failed 
to 
establish 
a 
correlation 
between 
tonsil 
size 
assessed 
by 
direct 
inspection 
and 
the 
various 
parameters 
of 
OSAS.8–10 
This 
well 
reported 
finding 
was 
also 
confirmed 
by 
our 
study, 
where 
a 
correlation 
between 
clinical 
tonsil 
size 
and 
severity 
of 
OSAS 
was 
not 
established. 
This 
is, 
however, 
not 
unexpected 
as 
on 
direct 
inspection, 
only 
the 
superior 
portion 
of 
the 
tonsil 
is 
seen, 
which 
does 
not 
reflect 
its 
true 
size 
and 
shape. 
This 
is 
further 
supported 
by 
our 
finding 
that 
there 
was 
no 
relation 
between 
tonsil 
size 
assessed 
clinically 
and 
the 
TP 
ratio. 


The 
radiographic 
TP 
ratio 
used 
is 
a 
clinically 
useful 
index 
of 
pharyngeal 
patency 
as 
it 
compares 
the 
amount 
of 
tonsillar 
tissue 
with 
the 
size 
of 
the 
pharyngeal 
compartment. 
It 
is 
easy 
to 
measure 
as 
it 
does 
not 
require 
the 
use 
of 
any 
sophisticated 
equipment. 
Shintani 
and 
colleagues15 
measured 
the 
TP 
ratio 
in 
140 
Japanese 
children 
with 
OSAS 
and 
an 
age 
matched 
control 
group 
of 
54 
children. 
Their 
mean 
age 
was 
4.5 
years. 
They 
found 
that 
the 
TP 
ratio 
increased 
with 
age 
and 
reached 
a 
peak 
when 
the 
children 
were 
5–6 
years, 
in 
both 
the 
control 
and 
OSAS 
groups. 
The 
value 
was 
also 
significantly 
greater 
in 
OSAS 
children 
than 
in 
controls 
in 
all 
age 
groups. 


Paediatric 
OSAS 
has 
been 
suggested 
to 
be 
primarily 
an 
anatomical 
problem, 
but 
more 
evidence 
is 
accumulating 
to 
show 
that 
the 
underlying 
mechanism 
is 
in 
fact 
a 
complicated 
interplay 
between 
various 
factors. 
Our 
group, 
in 
a 
previous 
unpublished 
study, 
assessed 
the 
severity 
of 
OSAS 
with 
sleep 
nasendoscopy. 
We 
found 
that 
patients 
with 
an 
AHI 
<10 
had 
mild 
disease 
as 
they 
had 
fewer 
obstructive 
episodes 
and 
no 
desaturations 
shown 
compared 
to 
those 
with 
moderate/severe 
disease 
and 
AHI 
>10. 
Brouillette 
and 
his 
group17 
also 
used 
an 
AHI 
of 
10 
to 
denote 
patients 
with 
mild 
disease, 
and 
found 
that

they 
could 
be 
managed 
with 
nasal 
steroid 
therapy 
with 
significant 
improvement 
in 
their 
symptoms. 
In 
the 
current 
study, 
we 
found 
24 
patients 
had 
an 
AHI 
>10, 
and 
11 
had 
an 
AHI 
<10. 
An 
ROC 
curve 
analysis 
found 
that 
a 
TP 
ratio 
of 
0.479 
was 
the 
optimal 
cut 
off 
for 
predicting 
moderate/severe 
cases 
of 
OSAS. 
The 
corresponding 
sensitivity 
and 
specificity 
were 
95.8% 
and 
81.8% 
respectively. 


The 
gold 
standard 
diagnostic 
test 
for 
OSAS 
is 
still 
the 
overnight 
multichannel 
polysomnography, 
which 
enables 
detection 
of 
obstructive 
apnoeas, 
hypopnoeas, 
and 
arousals. 
However, 
the 
system 
is 
very 
expensive 
to 
set 
up 
and 
run; 
consequently 
it 
is 
not 
widely 
available 
in 
all 
public 
hospitals. 
Patients 
with 
suspected 
OSAS 
have 
thus 
to 
wait 
for 
a 
long 
time, 
usually 
months, 
before 
being 
assessed. 
Various 
studies 
have 
looked 
at 
other 
screening 
methods, 
for 
example, 
symptom 
score 
and 
pulse 
oximetry. 
It 
was 
found 
that 
these 
methods 
have 
good 
sensitivity 
but 
were 
unreliable 
in 
differentiating 
between 
the 
different 
degrees 
of 
severity 
of 
the 
condition.11 
Our 
proposed 
method 
of 
using 
the 
TP 
ratio 
may 
prove 
to 
be 
a 
useful 
and 
simple 
clinical 
method 
in 
differentiating 
patients 
with 
OSA 
into 
mild 
disease 
and 
those 
with 
more 
significant 
problem. 
We 
are 
not 
advocating 
the 
use 
of 
this 
method 
in 
place 
of 
an 
overnight 
polysomnography. 
We 
are 
of 
the 
opinion 
that 
the 
TP 
ratio 
may 
screen 
out 
those 
patients 
with 
more 
severe 
OSAS 
so 
that 
they 
can 
be 
assessed 
at 
an 
earlier 
appointment. 
Before 
this 
method 
can 
be 
safely 
concluded 
to 
be 
widely 
applicable, 
it 
shoud 
be 
validated 
in 
a 
further 
cohort 
with 
a 
larger 
sample 
size.
