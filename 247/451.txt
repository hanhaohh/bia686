OBJECTIVES: 
1) 
To 
evaluate 
the 
relative 
severity 
of 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
(OSA) 
in 
obese 
and 
normal-weight 
children; 
2) 
to 
compare 
changes 
in 
respiratory 
parameters 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
in 
obese 
and 
normal-weight 
children. 
STUDY 
DESIGN 
AND 
SETTING: 
Prospective 
controlled 
trial 
that 
included 
children 
aged 
3 
to 
18 
years. 
All 
study 
participants 
underwent 
pre-and 
postoperative 
polysomnography. 
RESULTS: 
The 
study 
population 
included 
33 
obese 
children 
and 
39 
normal-weight 
controls. 
Preoperatively, 
the 
median 
obstructive 
apnea-hypopnea 
index 
(AHI) 
was 
23.4 
(range 
3.7-135.1) 
for 
obese 
and 
17.1 
(range 
3.9-36.5) 
for 
controls 
(P 
. 
0.001). 
Postoperatively, 
the 
AHI 
was 
3.1 
(range 
0-33.1) 
for 
obese 
and 
1.9 
(range 
0.1-7.0) 
for 
controls 
(P 
. 
0.01). 
Twenty-five 
obese 
children 
(76%) 
and 
11 
controls 
(28%) 
had 
persistent 
OSA. 
CONCLUSION 
AND 
SIGNIFICANCE: 
AHI 
scores 
are 
higher 
in 
obese 
than 
in 
normal-weight 
children 
with 
OSA. 
Both 
groups 
show 
a 
dramatic 
improvement 
in 
AHI 
after 
adenotonsillectomy, 
but 
persistent 
OSA 
is 
more 
common 
in 
obese 
children.

T
T
he 
prevalence 
of 
obesity 
in 
children 
has 
increased 
markedly 
in 
the 
last 
two 
decades. 
Approximately 
30 
percent 
of 
children 
in 
the 
United 
States 
are 
overweight 
at 
the 
present 
time, 
and 
16 
percent 
of 
them 
are 
considered 
obese.1 There is also increasing evidence that obesity in 
children has become a global problem.2,3 Although obese 
children 
have 
a 
number 
of 
health 
concerns, 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
(OSA) 
is 
common 
among 
them 
and 
is 
known 
to 
lead 
to a decrease in their quality of life.4 


A 
dysfunction 
in 
neuromotor 
control 
of 
the 
pharynx 
is 
thought to be the underlying cause of OSA in children,5 but 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy 
further 
narrows 
the 
airway 
and 
exacerbates 
OSA. 
Consequently, 
adenotonsillectomy 
improves 
OSA in the majority of children.6 In obese children, 
however, 
a 
number 
of 
factors 
in 
addition 
to 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy 
contribute 
to 
a 
high 
prevalence 
of 
OSA 
and 
may 
compromise 
surgical 
therapy. 
Adipose 
tissue 
immediately 
adjacent 
to 
the 
pharynx 
may 
decrease 
the 
cross-sectional 
area of the upper airway,7 and there may be external 
compression 
of 
the 
pharynx 
by 
fat 
in 
the 
subcutaneous 
tissues of the neck.8 A decrease in the compliance of the 
chest 
wall 
and 
the 
displacement 
of 
the 
diaphragm 
may 
also 


lessen 
the 
volume 
of 
the 
lungs. 
Therefore, 
it 
is 
not 
surprising 
that 
the 
prevalence 
of 
OSA 
in 
obese 
children 
is 
25 
to 
40 
percent.9 


Previous 
studies 
of 
the 
outcome 
of 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA 
in 
obese 
children 
have 
been 
limited 
by 
the 
lack 
of 
data 
from 
both 
pre-and 
postoperative 
polysomnography. 
These 
data 
are 
necessary 
to 
provide 
an 
objective 
evaluation 
of 
the 
outcome of surgery.10 In the present study, polysomnography 
was 
used 
to 
compare 
the 
outcome 
of 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA 
in 
obese 
and 
normal-weight 
children. 
The 
goal 
was 
to 
provide 
quantitative 
data 
on 
the 
relative 
effectiveness 
of 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA 
in 
obese 
children. 


METHODS 


Children 
referred 
to 
the 
pediatric 
otolaryngology 
service 
of 
the 
University 
of 
New 
Mexico 
Hospital 
with 
a 
sleep 
disturbance 
were 
evaluated 
for 
inclusion 
in 
the 
study. 
Institutional 
review 
board 
approval 
was 
obtained 
from 
the 
University 
of 
New 
Mexico, 
and 
caregivers 
of 
children 
signed 
an 
informed 
consent 
document 
prior 
to 
enrollment. 
All 
children 
considered 
for 
enrollment 
underwent 
polysomnography. 
Exclusion 
criteria 
included: 
1) 
children 
younger 
than 
three 
or 
older 
than 
18 
years; 
2) 
children 
who 
previously 
had 
an 
adenotonsillectomy; 
3) 
children 
with 
craniofacial 
syndromes, 
neuromuscular 
disease 
or 
developmental 
delay; 
and 
4) 
children 
with 
an 
obstructive 
apnea-hypopnea 
index 
(AHI) 
. 
2. 
Demographic 
information 
was 
collected 
for 
both 
caregiver 
and 
child. 


The 
age-and 
gender-corrected 
body 
mass 
index 
(BMI) 
was 
calculated 
for 
each 
child 
using 
established 
guidelines 
and 
children 
were 
divided 
into 
four 
groups 
as 
follows: 
group 
1, 
underweight 
(BMI 
less 
than 
or 
equal 
to 
the 
5th 
percentile); 
group 
2, 
normal 
(BMI 
greater 
than 
the 
5th 
percentile 
but 
less 
than 
the 
85th); 
group 
3, 
at 
risk 
for 
obesity 
(BMI 
greater 
than 
the 
85th 
percentile 
but 
less 
than 
the 
95th); 
group 
4, 
obese 
(BMI 
greater 
than 
or 
equal 
to 
the 
95th 
percentile). 
Children 
in 
group 
4 
were 
considered 
obese 
and 
were 
compared 
with 
the 
normal-weight 
children 
of 
group 
2. 


Tonsils 
were 
graded 
according 
to 
the 
scheme 
proposed 
by Brodsky11: (1) small tonsils confined to the tonsillar

the 
pillars; 
(3) 
tonsils 
that

(4) 
large 
tonsils 
that

The 
following 
parameters 
were 
measured 
during 
polysomnography: 
4-channel 
electroencephalography 
with 
bilateral 
central 
and 
occipital 
leads; 
electro-oculography 
to 
measure 
vertical 
and 
horizontal 
eye 
movements; 
electromyography 
with 
submental 
electrodes; 
electrocardiography; 
airflow 
recording 
through 
the 
nose 
and 
mouth 
by 
a 
nasal 
air 
pressure 
transducer 
with 
end 
tidal 
carbon 
dioxide; 
thoracic 
and 
abdominal 
effort 
by 
piezoelectric 
sensors; 
oxygen 
saturation 
through 
pulse 
oximetry; 
and 
tracheal 
sound 
recording 
by 
using 
a 
microphone 
secured 
to 
the 
neck. 
Digital 
videotaping 
with 
sound 
recording 
was 
performed 
throughout 
the 
night. 
A 
sleep 
medicine 
physician 
interpreted 
the 
polysomnography 
results. 
The 
obstructive 
AHI, 
defined 
as 
the 
average 
number 
of 
obstructive 
apneas 
and 
hypopneas 
per 
hour 
of 
sleep, 
was 
used 
for 
diagnosis 
of 
OSA. 
Obstructive 
apnea 
was 
defined 
as 
total 
absence 
of 
airflow 
through 
the 
mouth 
and 
nose 
with 
continued 
chest 
and 
abdominal 
movement 
for 
at 
least 
2 
respiratory 
cycles. 
Hypopnea 
was 
defined 
as 
a 
decrease 
in 
nasal 
flow 
of 
greater 
than 
50 
percent 
or 
a 
corresponding 
decrease 
in 
oxygen 
saturation 
of 
greater 
than or equal to 4 percent with an arousal.12 


OSA 
was 
defined 
as 
an 
AHI 
greater 
than 
or 
equal 
to 
2. 
Children 
were 
further 
divided 
according 
to 
the 
severity 
of 
OSA. 
Mild 
OSA 
was 
defined 
as 
an 
AHI 
greater 
than 
or 
equal 
to 
2 
but 
less 
than 
5; 
moderate 
OSA 
was 
defined 
as 
an 
AHI 
greater 
than 
or 
equal 
to 
5 
but 
less 
than 
15; 
severe 
OSA 
was 
defined 
as 
an 
AHI 
greater 
than 
or 
equal 
to 
15. 
On 
the 
basis 
of 
normative 
data, 
the 
statistically 
significant 
AHI 
in 
healthy children is 1.5 events per hour (mean  2 SD).13,14 
Therefore, 
children 
with 
a 
postoperative 
AHI 
of 
less 
than 
2 
were 
considered 
as 
having 
no 
evidence 
of 
persistent 
OSA. 


Tonsillectomy 
was 
performed 
with 
a 
combination 
of 
sharp 
and 
blunt 
dissection 
utilizing 
primarily 
a 
blade 
electrocautery. 
Adenoidectomy 
was 
performed 
using 
suction 
ablation 
and 
cautery. 


Data 
were 
analyzed 
with 
SPSS 
software 
(SPSS 
Inc, 
Chicago, 
IL). 
Pre-and 
postoperative 
AHI 
scores 
for 
both 
obese 
and 
normal-weight 
children 
were 
compared 
by 
repeated 
measures 
analysis 
of 
variance 
(ANOVA). 
Differences 
in 
outcomes 
between 
the 
two 
groups 
were 
compared 
by 
analysis 
of 
covariance 
with 
preoperative 
AHI 
as 
a 
covariate. 
X2 
with 
Fisher 
exact 
test 
was 
used 
where 
appropriate. 
Odds 
ratios 
were 
calculated 
by 
logistic 
regression. 
A 
P 
value 
less 
than 
or 
equal 
to 
0.05 
was 
considered 
significant. 


To 
calculate 
the 
sample 
size 
for 
the 
present 
study, 
we 
used 
as 
a 
model 
data 
from 
polysomnography 
for 
26 
children 
with 
OSA 
who 
underwent 
adenotonsillectomy 
and 
were 
studied by Suen et al.6 The mean preoperative AHI value for 
these 
children 
was 
18.1 
11.3 
and 
the 
postoperative 
value 
was 
4.5 
9.4. 
With 
the 
assumption 
of 
a 
moderate 
correlation 
of 
0.3 
between 
pre-and 
postoperative 
values, 
a 
population 
of 
29 
children 
with 
similar 
mean 
pre-and 
postoper


ative 
values 
and 
standard 
deviations 
for 
the 
AHI 
would 
be 
sufficient 
to 
detect 
a 
mean 
difference 
score 
of 
10.0 
with 
80 
percent 
power 
and 
.05 
using 
a 
2-tailed 
t 
test. 
A 
change 
in 
AHI 
from 
5 
to 
15 
indicates 
a 
change 
from 
mild 
to 
severe 
OSA.15 Therefore, the present study has sufficient power to 
detect 
a 
significant 
change 
in 
AHI 
for 
either 
obese 
or 
normal-
weight 
children 
after 
adenotonsillectomy. 


RESULTS 


Seventy-eight 
children 
with 
polysomnography-proven 
OSA 
were 
included 
in 
the 
present 
study. 
Two 
of 
these 
children 
were 
lost 
to 
follow-up, 
two 
others 
did 
not 
undergo 
adenotonsillectomy, 
and 
two 
children 
did 
not 
complete 
postoperative 
polysomnography. 
As 
a 
consequence, 
the 
study 
population 
included 
72 
children. 
Thirty-three 
of 
these 
children 
were 
obese 
and 
39 
were 
normal-weight. 
The 
mean 
age 
was 
similar 
between 
the 
two 
groups 
as 
was 
the 
mean 
interval 
between 
polysomnography 
and 
surgery. 
Hispanic 
or 
Latino 
children 
were 
significantly 
more 
likely 
to 
be 
obese 
but 
less 
likely to have marked enlargement of their tonsils (Table 1). 


A 
comparison 
of 
preoperative 
respiratory 
and 
nonrespiratory 
parameters 
in 
obese 
and 
normal-weight 
children 
is 
presented in Table 2. Preoperatively, the median obstructive 
AHI 
was 
23.4 
(range 
3.7-135.1) 
for 
obese 
children 
and 
17.1 
(range 
3.9-36.5) 
for 
controls 
(P 
0.001). 
Compared 
with 
normal-weight 
children, 
obese 
children 
also 
had 
significantly 
higher 
values 
(P 
0.001) 
for 
the 
following 
parameters: 
obstructive 
apnea 
index, 
oxygen 
saturation 
nadir, 
the 
percentage 
of 
rapid 
eye 
movement 
(REM) 
sleep, 
and 
the 
arousal 
index. 
The 
hypopnea 
index 
was 
higher 
in 
obese 
children 
than 
in 
normal-weight 
children, 
but 
the 
difference 
was 
barely 
significant 
(P 
0.05). 
The 
mean 
value 
for 
the 
central 
apnea 
index 
and 
the 
mean 
oxygen 
saturation 
nadir 
did 
not 
differ 
significantly 
between 
the 
two 
groups 
of 
children. 


Preoperative 
and 
postoperative 
mean 
scores 
as 
well 
as 
difference 
scores 
with 
95 
percent 
confidence 
intervals 
are 
summarized in Table 3. Respiratory and nonrespiratory parameters 
in 
obese 
and 
normal-weight 
children 
were 
compared. 
The 
mean 
postoperative 
AHI 
was 
6.0 
in 
obese 
children 
and 
2.4 
in 
normal-weight 
children. 
The 
postoperative 
AHI 
was 
significantly 
lower 
than 
the 
preoperative 
value 
for 
obese 
and 
normal-weight 
children 
(P 
. 
0.001). 
Changes 
postoperatively 
were 
also 
highly 
significant 
(P 
0.001) 
in 
the 
obstructive 
apnea 
index, 
the 
obstructive 
hypopnea 
index, 
the 
oxygen 
saturation 
nadir, 
and 
the 
arousal 
index 
for 
both 
groups 
of 
children. 
Postoperatively, 
the 
percentage 
of 
REM 
sleep 
was 
significantly 
improved 
in 
obese 
children 
but 
not 
in 
normal-weight 
children. 
After 
surgery, 
the 
central 
apnea 
index 
decreased 
significantly 
in 
normal-weight 
children 
but 
did 
not 
change 
significantly 
in 
obese 
children. 


A 
comparison 
of 
differences 
in 
postoperative 
parameters 
for obese and normal-weight children is presented in Table 
4. Postoperatively, the median AHI was 3.1 (range 0-33.1)

The 
percentages 
of 
children 
with 
mild, 
moderate, 
or 
severe 
OSA 
were 
different 
preoperatively 
in 
the 
obese 
and 
normal-weight groups (Fig 1 A and B). Seventy percent of 
obese 
children 
had 
severe 
preoperative 
OSA, 
while 
59 
percent 
of 
normal-weight 
children 
had 
severe

The 
odds 
ratio 
for 
obese 
compared 
with 
normal-

was 
1.86 
(95%

After

children 
had 
persistent 
OSA, 
and 
in 
15 
percent 
of 
these

the 
persistent 
OSA 
was

After

28 
percent 
had 
persistent 
OSA 
but 
none 
had severe persistent OSA (Fig 1 A and B). The odds ratio 
for 
persistent 
OSA 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
in 
obese 
compared 
with 
normal-weight 
children 
is 
6.25 
(95% 
CI 
1.8 
12.9, 
P 
. 
0.001). 


Persistent 
postoperative 
OSA 
was 
absent 
in 
both 
obese 
and 
normal-weight 
children 
with 
mild 
preoperative 
OSA.

However, 
it 
was 
present 
in 
all 
6 
(100%) 
obese 
children 
with 
moderate 
preoperative 
OSA 
and 
in 
18 
of 
24 
(75%) 
obese 
children 
with 
severe 
preoperative 
OSA. 
Similarly, 
it 
was 
present 
in 
9 
of 
14 
(64%) 
normal-weight 
children 
with 
moderate 
preoperative 
OSA 
and 
in

of 
23 
(43%) 
normal-

children 
with 
severe 
preoperative 
OSA. 
If 
preoperative 
AHI 
is 
used 
as 
a 
covariate, 
obesity 
has 
an 
adjusted 
odds 
ratio 
of 
4.7 
for 
persistent 
postoperative 
OSA 
(95 
CI 
1.7-11.2, 
P 
. 
0.02). 


To 
examine 
factors 
that 
might 
be 
associated 
with 
persistent 
OSA, 
we 
used 
ANOVA 
to 
evaluate 
the 
significance 
of 
gender, 
age, 
BMI, 
tonsillar 
size, 
and 
preoperative 
AHI 
as 
covariates. 
BMI 
and 
preoperative 
AHI 
were 
correlated 
significantly 
with 
persistent 
OSA 
(P 
.

DISCUSSION 


The 
present 
study 
demonstrates 
that 
important 
differences 
exist 
between 
obese 
and 
normal-weight 
children 
with 
OSA 
both 
before 
and 
after 
adenotonsillectomy. 
Obese 
children 
with 
OSA 
have 
a 
significantly 
higher 
mean 
number 
of 
apneas, 
hypopneas, 
and 
arousals 
per 
hour 
of 
sleep 
compared 
with 
normal-weight

with 
normal-weight 
children. 
Postoperatively, 
significant 
improvements 
occur 
in 
respiratory 
and 
nonrespiratory 
parameters 
for 
both 
groups 
of 
children. 
However, 
some 
important 
distinctions 
are 
evident. 
Obese 
children 
have 
a 
significantly 
higher 
obstructive 
AHI 
and 
arousal 
index 
but 
a 
lower 
mean 
oxygen 
nadir 
and 
a 
lower 
percentage 
of 
REM 
sleep 
compared 
with 
normal-weight 
children 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA. 


These 
differences 
are 
seen 
more 
clearly 
when 
children 
are 
categorized 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
relative 
severity 
of 
OSA. 
Prior 
to 
surgery, 
the 
majority 
of 
normal-weight 
children 
have 
mild 
to 
moderate 
OSA, 
whereas 
the 
majority 
of 
obese 


Table 
4 


children 
have 
severe 
OSA. 
After 
surgery, 
OSA 
resolves 
in 
the 
majority 
of 
normal-weight 
children. 
In 
contrast, 
OSA 
resolves 
in 
only 
24 
percent 
of 
obese 
children 
and 
15 
percent 
of 
them 
have 
persistent 
severe 
OSA. 
However, 
it 
is 
worth 
mentioning 
that 
up 
to 
28 
percent 
of 
normal-weight 
children 
did 
not 
normalize 
after 
adenotonsillectomy. 


Previous studies6,15 have demonstrated an association 
between 
persistent 
postoperative 
OSA 
and 
a 
high 
preoperative 
AHI. 
It 
is 
therefore 
not 
surprising 
that 
obese 
children, 
with 
a 
much 
higher 
mean 
preoperative 
AHI, 
are 
more 
likely 
to 
have 
persistent 
OSA 
after 
adenotonsillectomy. 
Nonetheless, 
even 
allowing 
for 
the 
correlation

Adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA 
in 
obese 
and 
normal-weight 
children. 


tween 
the 
severity 
of 
preoperative 
OSA 
and 
the 
higher 
likelihood of persistent OSA, O’Brien et al16 showed that 
obese 
children 
were 
much 
more 
likely 
to 
have 
persistent 
OSA 
after 
adenotonsillectomy. 


There 
are 
relatively 
few 
studies 
that 
have 
examined 
the 
outcome 
of 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA 
in 
obese 
children. 
The 
majority 
of 
these 
studies 
have 
relied 
on 
clinical 
reports 
by 
caregivers 
of 
improvements 
in 
symptoms 
or 
limited 
sleep 
studies 
to 
evaluate 
the 
outcome 
of 
surgery. 
Kudoh 
and 
Sanai3 
studied 
25 
obese 
children 
for 
a 
period 
of 
5 
to 
6 
days 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA. 
During 
this 
brief 
follow-
up 
period, 
they 
showed 
that 
surgery 
was 
effective 
in 
decreasing 
irregular 
breathing 
and 
oxygen 
desaturation 
during 
sleep as measured by pulse oximetry. Marcus et al13 
studied 
eight 
obese 
children 
with 
OSA 
and 
found 
that, 
after 
adenotonsillectomy, 
caregivers 
reported 
an 
improvement 
in 
sleep 
disturbances 
in 
all 
these 
children. 
Postoperative 
polysomnography 
was 
performed 
in 
two 
obese 
children, 
which 
showed resolution of OSA in both. Soultan et al17 reported 
a 
retrospective 
study 
of 
17 
obese 
children 
with 
OSA 
after 
adenotonsillectomy. 
The 
caregivers 
of 
eight 
of 
these 
children 
reported 
resolution 
of 
the 
symptoms 
of 
OSA 
after 
surgery. 
One 
child 
continued 
to 
have 
persistent 
snoring 
and 
in 
another 
child 
no 
improvement 
was 
reported. 
The 
remaining 
children 
were 
lost 
to 
follow-up. 
These 
studies 
were 
limited 
by 
the 
absence 
of 
data 
from 
polysomnography 
and 
by 
the 
small 
populations 
of 
children 
studied. 


Mitchell 
and 
Kelly4 
studied 
30 
obese 
children 
who 
underwent 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA. 
Polysomnography 
was 
used 
preoperatively 
to 
diagnose 
the 
severity 
of 
OSA 
in 
each 


child 
and 
postoperatively 
to 
evaluate 
the 
outcome 
of 
surgery. 
An 
AHI 
greater 
or 
equal 
to 
5 
was 
used 
to 
diagnose 
OSA. 
Quality 
of 
life 
was 
also 
measured 
before 
and 
after 
surgery 
by 
means of the OSA-18 survey.18 Mitchell and Kelly4 found that 
53 
percent 
of 
obese 
children 
had 
persistent 
OSA 
after 
adenotonsillectomy. 
The 
results 
of 
this 
study 
suggested 
that 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA 
leads 
to 
a 
dramatic 
improvement 
in 
quality 
of 
life 
but 
not 
to 
resolution 
of 
the 
underlying 
sleep 
disorder 
in 
the 
majority 
of 
obese 
children. 


O’Brien et al16 used pre- and postoperative polysomnography 
to 
study 
69 
children 
with 
OSA 
who 
underwent 
adenotonsillectomy. 
They 
defined 
OSA 
as 
an 
AHI 
greater 
than 
or 
equal 
to 
5. 
Twenty-nine 
(42%) 
of 
these 
children 
were 
obese. 
They 
showed 
that 
obesity 
at 
time 
of 
diagnosis 
was 
a 
major 
risk 
factor 
for 
persistent 
OSA, 
regardless 
of 
the 
severity 
of 
the 
initial 
disease. 
Persistent 
OSA 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
occurred 
in 
22 
percent 
of 
normal-weight 
children 
but 
in 
55 
percent 
of 
obese 
children. 
The 
present 
study 
used 
a 
less 
conservative 
definition 
of 
OSA 
that 
included 
children 
with an AHI greater than or equal to 2.14 As a consequence, 
a 
higher 
proportion 
of 
obese 
children 
(76%) 
in 
the 
present 
study 
had 
persistent 
OSA 
after 
adenotonsillectomy. 


The 
study 
has 
a 
number 
of 
limitations 
that 
require 
discussion. 
The 
population 
of 
children 
referred 
for 
surgical 
therapy 
is 
likely 
to 
have 
more 
severe 
OSA 
than 
that 
seen 
in 
a 
community 
setting. 
The 
follow-up 
period 
was 
also 
relatively 
short. 
It 
is 
possible 
that, 
over 
a 
period 
of 
years, 
the 
differences 
in 
outcome 
between 
obese 
and 
normal-weight 
children 
may 
change 
in 
comparison 
with 
the 
short-term 
outcome 
reported 
in 
this 
study. 
Furthermore, 
normal-weight 
children 
may 
not 
be 
the 
ideal 



Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery, Vol 137, No 1, July 2007 

control 
group. 
Direct 
comparison 
of 
obese 
children 
who 
did 
or 
did 
not 
undergo 
surgical 
intervention 
would 
have 
made 
it 
possible 
to 
establish 
causality 
between 
adenotonsillectomy 
and 
improvements 
in 
polysomnography. 
However, 
ethical 
considerations 
arise 
if 
surgical 
therapy 
is 
not 
offered 
to 
children 
with 
OSA 
who 
are 
symptomatic. 


Surgical 
outcome 
was 
measured 
by 
using 
objective 
data 
from 
polysomnography. 
Other 
outcome 
measures 
including 
improvements 
in 
quality 
of 
life 
and 
behavior, 
and 
changes 
in 
the 
child’s 
weight 
may 
have 
given 
a 
more 
comprehensive 
measure of surgical outcome. Indeed, Roemmich et al19 
studied 
54 
children 
with 
OSA 
before 
and 
at 
a 
mean 
of 
12 
months 
after 
adenotonsillectomy. 
These 
children 
had 
a 
mean 
BMI 
in 
the 
73rd 
percentile 
prior 
to 
surgery. 
A 
significant 
improvement 
was 
noted 
in 
the 
AHI 
after 
surgery. 
However, 
there 
was 
also 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
mean 
BMI 
that 
was 
correlated 
with 
decreased 
hyperactivity 
scores 
and 
decreased 
motor activity. Similarly, Soultan et al17 showed 
that 
treating 
OSA 
with 
adenotonsillectomy 
is 
associated 
with 
increase 
in 
weight 
in 
all 
children 
including 
those 
who 
are obese. Kudoh and Sanai3 reported no decrease in weight 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA 
in 
obese 
children 
despite 
the 
fact 
that 
dietary 
treatment 
was 
given 
before 
surgery. 
Clearly, 
surgical 
therapy 
for 
OSA 
in 
obese 
children 
may 
improve 
quality of life6 but does not lead to weight reduction. 


In 
conclusion, 
obese 
children 
are 
more 
likely 
than 
normal-
weight 
children 
to 
have 
severe 
OSA. 
In 
addition, 
OSA 
is 
less 
likely 
to 
resolve 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
in 
obese 
children 
than 
in 
normal-weight 
children. 
Because 
there 
is 
compelling 
evidence 
that 
OSA 
affects 
educational 
performance 
negatively, 
there 
is 
a 
pressing 
need 
to 
develop 
comprehensive 
therapy 
for 
obese 
children 
with 
OSA 
so 
that 
they 
can 
progress 
through 
their 
education 
free 
from 
the 
disadvantages 
of 
excessive 
weight 
and 
sleep 
disturbance.
