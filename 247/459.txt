Measurement of pharyngeal dimensions may contribute to the characterization 
of anatomic risk factors for sleep-disordered breathing 
(SDB) in children. Acoustic pharyngometry, a noninvasive method, 
has been used successfully in adults, but application in children 
has been limited. We sought to evaluate the feasibility and utility 
of this technique in children, including assessment of the variation 
of pharyngeal measurements with height, sex, ethnicity, prematurity, 
and indices of SDB. Subjects were drawn from a large, community-
based cohort of children of age 8–11 years. Demographic, 
morphologic, and sleep-related information were collected via 
standard questionnaires, direct measurement, and home cardiorespiratory 
monitoring during sleep. Pharyngeal dimensions were 
assessed in 203 children using acoustic pharyngometry performed 
with an optimized mouthpiece. In this sample, the coefficient of 
variation of minimum pharyngeal cross-sectional area (CSA) and 
mean CSA were similar to those in adults (8.0 and 11.1%, respectively). 
The minimum CSA, but not mean CSA, was significantly reduced 
in preterm children, habitual snorers, and children with 
SDB relative to unaffected children. Thus, minimum CSA is a useful 
measure for evaluating SDB risk factors in preadolescent children.

Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is a complex, chronic disease 
that is expressed after a given threshold level of susceptibility is 
exceeded. Susceptibility relates to the propensity for repetitive 
upper airway collapse. In any given individual, anatomic and 
neuromuscular factors that influence upper airway size and/or 
function determine this propensity. In adults, the strongest risk 
factors for SDB are obesity and male sex (1). In children, adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy and major craniofacial anomalies are 
considered to be important risk factors for SDB (2, 3). However, 
the relative contribution of craniofacial morphologic 
(hard and soft tissue) features to SDB susceptibility has not 
been well-defined in children. Reduced pharyngeal cross-sectional 
area (CSA) may be a final common pathway by which genetic 
and other factors impact the development of SDB. 

Acoustic pharyngometry, a noninvasive technique, has 
been used to assess pharyngeal size and compliance in adult 
snorers with and without SDB (4–7). These studies showed 
that snorers had smaller CSA, regardless of apnea–hypopnea 
index (AHI), and that those with SDB (defined by an elevated 
AHI) exhibited higher pharyngeal compliance (as measured 
by fractional change of pharyngeal area with varying mouth

pressure), a marker of susceptibility to collapse (4, 5). These 
studies also suggested that the acoustic pharyngometry technique 
is reasonably precise. In adults, intrasubject variability 
of pharyngometric measures was reported as less than 10% 
(5, 6). Similar data in children are not available, and the contribution 
of reduced pharyngeal CSA to SDB has not been 
quantified in the pediatric population. 

The paucity of data that address risk factors, outcomes, and 
the natural history of SDB in children has led to a recent interest 
in epidemiologic studies of pediatric SDB. Studies of large 
samples of children require reliable, noninvasive tools that provide 
discriminative or predictive information. As part of the 
Cleveland Children’s Sleep and Health Study (CCSHS), we 
collected pharyngometry data, using the acoustic reflection 
technique, on a well-defined cohort of children born in the 
Cleveland area between 1988 and 1993. Using concurrently 
collected demographic, upper airway, and home sleep study 
data, we aimed to (1) evaluate the utility of using acoustic 
pharyngometry to characterize upper airway dimensions in 
children with and without SDB and (2) characterize the variation 
of pharyngeal dimensions with demographic, anthropometric, 
and sleep-related variables. 

METHODS 

Details on definitions, measurements, and scoring of respiratory events 
can be found in the online data supplement. 

Study Sample and Data Acquisition 

The CCSHS is an ongoing epidemiologic study of risk factors and consequences 
of SDB in children aged 8–11 years. The sample was assembled 
as a birth cohort of children born between 1988 and 1993 at three 
Cleveland hospitals, identified by stratified random sampling from 
birth records to enroll equal numbers of preterm and full-term children 
(8). Children with known severe neurologic handicaps were excluded 
from analyses. 

Demographic and medical data were assessed with the Children’s 
Health Questionnaire, a pediatric modification of a validated instrument 
(9). Height and weight were measured by trained research personnel. 
Tonsillar size was noted on a 5-point scale (10). Overnight cardiorespiratory 
monitoring during sleep included recording of thoracic 
and abdominal excursions, estimated tidal volume (by inductance 
plethysmography) (11, 12), pulse oximetry, heart rate (bipolar electrocardiography 
leads), and body position (PT-2 system; SensorMedics, 
Yorba Linda, CA). 

Pharyngometry Measurements 

Pharyngometry data were collected the day before the sleep study, 
usually in the child’s home, using the EccoVision Acoustic Pharyngometer 
(E. Benson Hood Laboratories, Pembroke, MA). This system 
has been used in adults to measure pharyngeal CSA (4, 13). Each 
measurement consists of a plot of CSA (square centimeters) as a function 
of distance (centimeter) from the oral cavity. Estimates of mean 
and minimal pharyngeal CSA are derived. For each subject, a baseline 
curve was obtained using nasal breathing. Subsequent measurements 
were obtained using oral breathing (nares clamped) at functional residual 
capacity. Attempts were made to get at least three “high quality” 
curves that exhibit characteristics seen on a reference diagram 
(see online data supplement), namely a well-defined oral cavity seg

ment between 0–5 cm, a distinct oropharyngeal segment, and no evidence 
of tongue occlusion or leak. Curves without obvious artifacts 
but that did not meet the criteria for high quality, were considered 
“indeterminate” and excluded from analyses. 

To adapt the device to children, a customized pediatric mouthpiece 
was introduced partway through the study and was used for testing 
the last 60% of the sample (n  374). The use of the new mouthpiece 
resulted in an approximate 2-fold increase in the proportion of 
subjects with high quality data. Analyses were further restricted to the 
203 children who had used the new mouthpiece and who produced 
three high quality curves (54%). 

Scoring of Respiratory Events 

Respiratory events and the AHI were scored and computed as detailed 
in the online data supplement. The AHI was calculated by summing all 
obstructive apneas and hypopneas associated with a 3% desaturation 
and dividing the sum by the estimated sleep time. This index demonstrated 
excellent agreement with the AHI measured by ‘gold standard’ 
in-laboratory polysomnography (see online data supplement). 

Cephalometry 

Lateral cephalometric radiographs were available for 23 of the children 
who participated in a second-stage laboratory assessment aimed 
at further exploring the findings of the in-home studies. Procedures 
for cephalometry have been described previously (1). Cephalometric 
measures included mandibular length, hyoid-mandibular position, and 
the angles from the sella–nasion to mandibular points A and B (angles 
SNA and SNB, respectively). 

Analyses 

Group comparisons were performed using unpaired t tests or analysis 
of variance. The relationships among variables were evaluated with 
Spearman correlation coefficients. Analysis was performed using standard 
software (SAS Version 8.2; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). 

The protocol was approved by University Hospitals’ Institutional 
Review Board. Informed consent was obtained from the parents/legal 
guardian of each child, and assent was obtained from the child. 

RESULTS 

Sample Characteristics 

The sample consisted of 203 children with a mean age ( standard 
deviation) of 9.35  0.82 years (described in Table 1). 
There was a slight female predominance (53%), and one-half 
of the participants were black. More than half (53%) of the 
subjects were born prematurely (48 born between 20 and 32 
weeks, 41 born after 32 weeks, and 18 of uncertain gestational 
age younger than 36 weeks). The average height percentile 
was 56  27% (slightly above the 50th percentile for age and 
sex). Mean body mass index (BMI) was 18.2 kg/m2  4.0. The 
median AHI was 0.2 (range 0–42). The prevalence of SDB, 
defined by an AHI value of 5 events/hour or more, was 4.5%, 
and the prevalence of snoring with an AHI value less than 5 
was 17.4%. As expected, snoring and AHI were significantly 
associated, although there was considerable overlap between 
these entities (Spearman’s r  0.22, p  0.002). 

None of the characteristics in the subsample defined by use 
of a customized mouthpiece and ability to produce high quality 
pharyngometry data varied substantially from those of the 
overall CCSHS cohort (n  657 at the time of analysis), with 
the exception that the analyzed sample consisted of a larger 
proportion of black children than in the overall cohort. This 
difference is attributable to preferential recruitment of blacks 
later in the study, which coincided temporally with the introduction 
of the optimized pediatric pharyngometry mouthpiece. 

Quality and Reproducibility of Pharyngeal Measurements 

As noted previously, the quality of pharyngometry data increased 
substantially after the introduction of the customized

mouthpiece. Within the subset evaluated with the new mouthpiece 
(n  374), 54% had high quality data (all three curves 
with the highest rating). The coefficient of variation (CV) of 
the mean CSA was significantly lower in the high quality 
group when compared with the rest of the sample who used 
the new mouthpiece, but produced less than three high quality 
curves (including indeterminate curves) (8.0 versus 12.8%, 
p  0.0001). The CV of minimum CSA was modestly elevated 
relative to the CV of mean CSA. However, similar to the CV 
of mean CSA, the CV of minimum CSA was significantly 
lower in the high quality group within the subset of subjects 
who used the new mouthpiece (11.1 versus 18.1%, p  0.0001). 

Pharyngeal Dimensions as a Function of 
Subject Characteristics 

Table 2 shows mean and minimum pharyngeal CSA according 
to demographic and anthropometric variables. No significant 
differences are noted based on ethnicity, sex, or BMI. A modest 
(6%) but significant increase in both mean and minimum 
CSA exists among taller than average children when compared 
with those who are shorter than average. Children 9–11 
years old also show a significant (p  0.005) increase in minimum 
CSA when compared with the younger subjects (ages 
8.0–8.9 years). A trend toward a modestly (4.5%) increased 
mean CSA exists in older children, although this difference 
did not reach statistical significance (p  0.07). Subjects born 
prematurely, when compared with full-term children, had a 
modest but significant reduction in minimum CSA (5.9%, p  
0.05). A somewhat smaller reduction in mean CSA (4%) did 
not reach statistical significance. Differences in mean or minimal 
CSA were not significant across the range of gestational 
age (data not shown). 

Although we did not aim to present a predictive model for 
SDB (but rather to identify the feasibility of the technique and 
the its correlates of pharyngeal dimensions), we explored the ex

to pharyngeal CSA. In a multiple regression model, assessing 
the joint effects of age, height, sex, and prematurity, only height 
remained significantly related to minimal CSA (p  0.003). 

Variation of Pharyngeal Measurements by 
Sleep-related Measures 

Table 3 demonstrates the variability of mean and minimum 
CSA with degree of SDB (snoring or AHI  5). Habitual snorers 
showed a highly significant reduction (10.3%, p  0.006) in 
minimum CSA compared with nonsnorers. Likewise, children 
with an AHI value of 5 or more had a significantly smaller 
minimum CSA (10.4%, p  0.05) than those with an AHI 
value less than 5. Furthermore, minimal CSA appeared to vary 
in a “dose–effect” fashion with degree of SDB (1.17  0.26, 

1.07  0.23, and 0.96  0.14 in nonsnorers [n  157], snorers 
with an AHI value less than 5 [n  35], and children with an 
AHI value of 5 or more [n  9]). Mean CSA did not vary significantly 
across these categories. Minimum CSA also correlated 
inversely with the degree of nocturnal snoring (assessed 
on a 0–5 point scale, 0 being no snoring and 5 being very frequent 
snoring over the past month) (r 0.15, p  0.03). 
We also evaluated the association between tonsil size and 
pharyngeal measurements. For this analysis, tonsil size was 
analyzed both by comparing those with and without moderate–
large tonsils and by comparing the two groups at each extreme 
for tonsil size ( 25% of pharyngeal space, n  55 versus 
 75% of pharyngeal space, n  15). In both cases, no

defined on the scale described previously was significantly increased 
in subjects with larger tonsils (r  0.25, p  0.005). 

Association Between Pharyngometric and 
Cephalometric Measures 

Mean, but not minimal, pharyngeal CSA was significantly correlated 
with mandibular length as determined by cephalometry 
(r  0.47, p  0.02). No significant relationships were observed 
between either pharyngometric measure and hyoid 
mandibular plane, or angle SNA or SNB. 

DISCUSSION 

Utility of Pharyngometry in Studies of Pediatric SDB 

The usefulness of any diagnostic test depends on numerous factors, 
including its feasibility, predictive ability (regarding predicting 
clinical endpoints or discriminating subgroups of the 
population), precision (or reliability), accuracy, and cost. We 
have demonstrated that acoustic pharyngometry can be adapted 
for use in children, and trained personnel can successfully obtain 
highly reproducible data even in nonclinical settings (such 
as the home). In such settings, however, only 78% of children of 
age 8–11 years were able to produce minimally acceptable data; 
and high quality data could only be achieved reproducibly for 
54% of the sample studied with the improved mouthpiece. In 
the subset able to produce three acceptable curves, reliability 
was excellent and comparable to that reported by reports for 
adults studied in more controlled office or laboratory settings (4, 
6). Furthermore, as discussed subsequently, these measurements 
provided data that discriminated children with and without 
snoring and SDB. Measurements also varied in an expected 
manner with indices of body size and growth (height and age). 
In addition, pharyngeal dimensions were reduced in children 
who had been born prematurely—a subgroup we have shown in 
preliminary work to be at increased risk for SDB. 

The failure rate reported in the current study should be 
balanced against the portability and brevity of the measurements, 
which generally took less than 15 minutes and were 
conducted in the homes of study participants. Alternatives, 
such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or endoscopy, although 
considerably more accurate and comprehensive, are also 
much more expensive and less accessible. The variation of acoustic 
pharyngometry measurements across snoring/SDB groups 
suggests the utility of this technique for the clinical assessment 
of children at risk for SDB or for phenotyping in research 
studies, provided that increased technical experience reduces 
the failure rates. 


1502 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE VOL 165 2002 

This study did not directly compare acoustic pharyngometry 
with MRI. In our epidemiologic study, such assessments 
were not feasible and would have required comparing measurements 
made supine (MRI) with those made upright (pharyngometry). 
However, a previous study of adults assessed with 
both MRI and acoustic pharyngometry showed that the two 
techniques provided estimates of mean oropharyngeal area 
and pharyngeal volume within approximately 20 and 10% of 
each other, respectively (6). Radiographic comparisons have 
shown that pharyngometry allows accurate reconstructions of 
the geometry of other airway structures including the larynx, 
trachea, and nasal airways (6). Airway models that have been 
used to assess the accuracy of the technique further indicate 
that accuracy is greater with smaller mouth areas (6). 

These findings, together with the qualitatively similar curves 
obtained in children and adults, suggest that acoustic reflectometry 
in children who can reliably perform the maneuver 
should provide assessments of airway size at least as accurate 
as what has been reported for adults with larger mouths. 

We did assess the relationship of pharyngometric and cephalometric 
measurements (both made in the sitting position) in 
a sample of the cohort who participated in a second-stage laboratory 
study. A previous study of adults had reported that 
subjects with severe sleep apnea had both reduced mean pharyngeal 
CSA and mandibular length (7). Our finding of a correlation 
between mandibular length, which is generally considered 
to be an important skeletal determinant of pharyngeal 
size, and mean CSA supports the overall validity of the latter 
noninvasive measure for estimating anatomic risk factors for 
SDB in children. The lack of significant relationships between 
minimal CSA and mandibular length also is not surprising because 
minimal and mean CSA were only moderately correlated 
(r 0.62), and minimal CSA may be influenced more 
by discrete areas of anatomic compromise (soft tissue) than by 
a general reduction in area. 

Unlike in pediatrics, a standard curve has been established 
for acoustic pharyngometry in adults. In 350 normal volunteers 
(77% male), the mean CSA was 3.19  0.311 cm2 in 
males and 2.81  0.108 cm2 in females, with a CV of 5–7% 
(14). Clearly, our results cannot be compared directly because 
of the disparate ages of subjects in the two studies. However, 
both estimates of reproducibility are of the same order of 
magnitude as in previous studies (4, 6). Thus, it appears that 
this tool can be a precise instrument when used in pediatric 
subjects, provided that data are screened for quality and that a 
proper mouthpiece is used. 

Relationship of Pharyngeal Dimensions to Snoring and SDB 

A major objective of this study was to assess the variation of 
pharyngeal dimensions, assessed noninvasively, with indices of 
SDB in children. Reduced minimum pharyngeal CSA was 
demonstrated in both habitual snorers and in children with an 
AHI value of 5 or more when compared with nonsnorers and 
children with lesser AHI values, respectively. Furthermore, evidence 
of a dose–effect relationship was suggested for the relationship 
of degree of SDB (snoring or AHI  5) with minimal 
pharyngeal CSA. Coupled with the result that mean CSA is not 
decreased in the snorers or those with SDB, this finding suggests 
that minimum CSA, rather than mean CSA, may serve as 
a “critical variable” for the development of obstructive sleep 
apnea (OSA) in children. This observation makes sense in the 
context of fluid flow through a nonrigid tube, as in air traveling 
through the pharynx or blood flow through a vessel. The flow-
limiting feature in an atherosclerotic coronary artery, for example, 
is the point along the vessel where the lumen is most narrowed, 
as opposed to the average CSA along the length of the 

vessel. A previous study of pharyngeal dimensions in adults 
with sleep apnea assessed by computerized tomography provides 
further evidence in support of the concept of minimum 
CSA as a critical variable (15). No differences in mean pharyngeal 
CSA were observed in 12 men with sleep apnea compared 
with 17 matched control subjects. However, minimal CSA was, 
on average, approximately 50% the magnitude in the apneic 
group as compared with the control group. As in that study, we 
cannot identify the precise anatomic location of the minimal 
CSA, which likely varies somewhat from child to child. 

In the case of airflow through the oropharynx, previous investigators 
have introduced the concept of a “critical pressure” 
(Pcrit) to provide a mechanical basis for upper airway collapsibility. 
In this model, pharyngeal airflow can only occur when 
upstream pressure exceeds the intrinsic pressure in the 
oropharynx, Pcrit, extrapolated from a plot of pharyngeal flow 
versus nasal pressure as the applied pressure at zero flow (16– 
18). In adults, Pcrit is negative (airways stay patent) in normal 
subjects (19), less negative in snorers (increased susceptibility 
to collapse), and positive (airway collapse leading to obstruction) 
during sleep in subjects with OSA (16). Similarly, in children, 
a positive critical pressure was found in subjects with 
OSA and a negative Pcrit was found in primary snorers and in a 
subset of OSA subjects after undergoing tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy 
(20). Our findings of a relationship between indices 
of SDB and a reduced minimum CSA may be interpreted 
within this physiologic framework: a minimal pharyngeal CSA 
may lead to decreased intraluminal pressure in the pharynx 
distal to the obstruction, resulting in an increased susceptibility 
to collapse. Other studies using pharyngometry have identified 
a reduced mean CSA in adult snorers and subjects with OSA 
(4, 7). However, those findings included individuals with a 
greater degree of SDB than what was observed in our study. 

Relationship of Pharyngeal Area to Subject Demographics 

Our results demonstrate no difference in pharyngeal CSA between 
white and nonwhite (predominantly black) children. In 
light of previous findings that black children have a greater 
chance of developing SDB than white children (21), this result 
suggests that the racial difference in prevalence of SDB may not 
be explained by differences in minimal pharyngeal dimensions 
alone. These new data that address pharyngeal dimensions complement 
our previous studies of anthropometric and cephalometric 
measurements (1, 22). In those studies, we found that hard 
tissue craniofacial dimensions contribute little to SDB in blacks. 

In contrast to adult data (14), we did not observe significant 
sex differences in pharyngeal dimensions in our sample of prepubertal 
children. This result may simply reflect similarities in 
overall body size, as there were no sex differences in height percentile 
or BMI in our sample (male 54  27%, 18.3  3.7 kg/m2 
versus female 58  28%, 18.1  4.2 kg/m2; p  0.41, p  0.69, 
respectively). Longitudinal follow-up of children and young 
adults with simple tools such as acoustic reflectometry may shed 
further light on how pharyngeal dimensions change after puberty 
and with growth and maturation and hormonal changes. 

Reduced Pharyngeal Area and Prematurity 

Minimum CSA was also significantly reduced in preterm children, 
studied at ages 8–11 years, relative to full-term children. 
This finding is interesting in light of our preliminary data indicating 
that SDB is more common among children born prematurely 
than in full-term children (6.4 versus 1.9%, p  0.06) 
(23). In updating these preliminary results, using our larger 
sample, we find a bigger difference in the prevalence of SDB 
in preterm relative to full-term children (7.4 versus 1.1%, p 

shorter stature of these children: the premature children are 
significantly shorter, although still of average height for their 
age and sex, than the full-term children (52 versus 61%, p  
0.02). In children, it will be of especial importance to determine 
whether small airway dimensions, occurring either in or 
out of proportion to general body size, increases SDB risk. Future 
work is needed to further characterize the relationship 
between prematurity, body and pharyngeal size (and their interrelationship), 
and susceptibility to SDB. 

Relationship of Tonsil Size, Habitual Snoring, and 
Pharyngeal Dimensions 

No relationship was seen between tonsil size and minimum or 
mean CSA. However, tonsil size (dichotomized at a cutoff 
identified by tonsillar volume occupying 50% or more of the 
visible airway) strongly predicted snoring (odds ratio 2.53, 
95% confidence interval 1.25–5.14, p  0.01). A more modest, 
nonsignificant association was seen between tonsil size and an 
AHI value of 5 or more (odds ratio 1.96, 95% confidence interval 
0.51–7.53; p  0.3). These results suggest that children 
with increased tonsillar size are more likely to snore compared 
with children with smaller tonsils; however, tonsillar size, as 
quantified by physical examination, does not strongly predict 
AHI levels. A small minimum pharyngeal CSA, in contrast, 
predicted both snoring and an elevated AHI. Thus, measurement 
of pharyngeal CSA appears to be more strongly associated 
with AHI levels than tonsillar size as assessed by physical 
exam. This result suggests that acoustic reflectometry may 
provide important information in the evaluation of pediatric 
SDB not otherwise accessible via routine examination. 

The propensity for habitual snoring and SDB is likely influenced 
by multiple factors including airway dimensions, tonsil 
size, soft tissue mass, facial anatomy, and neuromuscular function—
combinations of abnormalities in some or all of these 
areas may produce the SDB phenotype. Tonsil size, as assessed 
by physical examination, may be too crude an index of 
anatomic compromise of the airway to differentiate children 
in the community with and without SDB. In contrast, our data 
suggest that pharyngometric measurements of minimum CSA 
could contribute to the prediction of SDB in large samples of 
unselected children. 

Conclusions and Limitations 

To summarize, we conclude (1) acoustic pharyngometry is a 
useful alternative to more invasive and expensive methods of 
measuring pharyngeal dimensions in preadolescent children 
and may provide information beyond that available by physical 
examination, and (2) minimum pharyngeal CSA represents 
a potentially important metric in evaluation of pediatric 
SDB. The application of acoustic pharyngometry, however, is 
limited to a subset of potential subjects, presumably those 
with the capacity to both follow the instructions and to put 
forth the necessary effort to complete the study. 

We also provide new data that suggest that preterm children 
have smaller pharyngeal dimensions and that this may be 
one explanation for the increased risk of SDB with prematurity 
that we have observed. Future work is needed to further 
assess the link between prematurity, pharyngeal measurements, 
and subsequent development of SDB and to model additional 
physiologic and anatomic risk factors for SDB.
