This study examined risk factors for sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in children and adolescents; 
specifically, quantifying risk associated with obesity, race, and upper and lower respiratory problems. 
Subjects were participants in a genetic-epidemiologic study of SDB and included 399 children and adolescents 
2 to 18 yr of age, recruited as members of families with a member (a proband) with known 
sleep apnea (31 index families) or as members of neighborhood control families (30 families). SDB 
was assessed with home overnight multichannel monitoring and SDB was defined based on an apneahypopnea 
index > 10 (moderately affected) or , 5 (unaffected). SDB of moderate level was significantly 
associated with obesity (odds ratio, 4.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.58 to 13.33) and African-
American race (odds ratio, 3.49; 95% CI, 1.56 to 8.32) but not with sex or age. After adjusting for 
obesity, proband sampling, race and familial clustering, sinus problems and persistent wheeze each 
independently (of the other) predicted SDB. These data suggest the importance of upper and lower 
respiratory problems and obesity as risk factors for SDB in children and adolescents. Increased risk in 
African Americans appears to be independent of the effects of obesity or respiratory problems. Red-

Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) refers to the occurrence of 
repetitive episodes of complete or partial obstruction of the 
upper airway during sleep, usually in association with loud 
snoring and daytime sleepiness. Episodes of upper airway obstruction 
often are associated with arousals, sleep fragmentation, 
intermittent hypoxemia and hypercapnia, and nocturnal 
hypertension. The long-term consequences of SDB may include 
sustained daytime hypertension and increased cardiovascular 
and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality. Relatively 
recent epidemiologic data have shown the disorder to 
be prevalent in adults, affecting . 9% of those 30 to 60 yr of 
age (1). Much less data are available for children. Despite an 
increased clinical experience with diagnosing and treating 
children with snoring and upper airway obstruction, there has 
not been an appreciable increase in knowledge regarding the 
overall prevalence of clinically significant SDB in children, 
risk factors for the disorder, and consequences of SDB of various 
degrees of severity. Characterization of risk factors for 
SDB could help identify susceptible children, which may pro

strategies. 

In this study, we assessed putative risk factors for SDB in a 
large sample of children, specifically quantifying the independent 
risks associated with obesity, sex, race, and upper and 
lower respiratory problems. 

METHODS 

Sample 

The study population consisted of children 2 to 18 yr of age who participated 
in the Cleveland Family Study, a community-based genetic-
epidemiologic study of sleep apnea. The larger cohort consists of index 
and control families, recruited using methods previously detailed 
(2, 3). Briefly, “index” families were identified because one member 
(the proband) had laboratory-confirmed sleep apnea. Neighborhood 
control families were chosen randomly from a list of names provided 
by the index proband of neighbors/friends with living relatives who resided 
in the area. In toto, 399 children 2 to 18 yr of age were identified 
who had a technically acceptable overnight sleep study. Of these children, 
273 were members of 31 index families and 126 were members 
of 30 control families. 

Protocol 

All subjects were studied in their homes, where they were visited by a 
trained technician who distributed and administered questionnaires, 
made physical measurements, performed spirometry, and provided instruction 
on the use of an overnight sleep monitor. For subjects > 13 
yr of age, medical history, medication use, family history, and symptoms 
were assessed with the Sleep and Health Modified SCOR Questionnaire 
(4). This instrument included questions pertaining to respiratory 
symptoms and illnesses that are identical or similar to those 


1528 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE VOL 159 1999 

used in the American Thoracic Association-DLD Standardized Respiratory 
Symptom Questionnaire for children (5). A modified version of 
this questionnaire, completed by the child’s primary caretaker, was 
used for younger children. Height, neck circumference, and weight 
were measured directly. Spirometry was performed in a sitting position 
and with the use of noseclips, using a portable spirometer (Multi-
Spiro, Irvine, CA). Three acceptable forced vital capacity maneuvers 
were obtained (6). Overnight sleep monitoring was accomplished with 
an Edentrace I or II monitor (Edentec, Inc., Eden Prairie, MN), with 
measurement of airflow (nasal/oral thermistry), chest wall impedance, 
finger pulse oximetry, and heart rate, as described previously (7). 

Data Extraction 

Pulmonary symptoms, illnesses, and exposures were identified by the 
following criteria. 

Asthma. The child was reported as having had asthma and the diagnosis 
was reported to have been confirmed by a doctor. 

Occasional wheeze. The child’s chest was reported to sound 
“wheezy or whistling” during the last year, and this occurred at times 
other than “only with colds.” 

Persistent wheezing. Wheezing or whistling was reported as occurring 
“most days or nights.” 

Cough. Report of cough occurring “usually” during the previous 
year. 

Sinus problems, hay fever. Reported to have occurred any time 
during the child’s life. 

Bronchitis. The child was reported to have “chronic bronchitis.” 

Maternal passive smoking. The child’s mother reported smoking at 
least one cigarette per day during the previous month. 

Body mass index (BMI) was computed by dividing weight (in kilograms) 
by height-squared (in meters). Obesity was considered present 
if the BMI was . 28 kg/m2 (8). 

The FEV1 and FVC were derived from the FVC maneuver with 
greatest summed value of FVC and FEV1 that also met ATS standards 
of acceptability (6). The percent predicted values were based on 
published regression equations, with adjustments for age, height, and 
sex (9). 

From the sleep studies, respiratory events were defined as cessations 
(apneas) or discrete reductions (hypopneas) in airflow or chest 
impedance, lasting > 10 s and associated with > 2.5% fall in oxygen 
saturation. Sleep time was estimated from visual inspection of the 
sleep record, correlated with a sleep diary completed by the subject or 
the subject’s parent. The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was determined 
by dividing the number of respiratory events by the estimated 
sleep time. The AHI measured with this approach has been shown 
previously to correlate excellently with in-laboratory polysomnography, 
which includes EEG, EOG, and EMG measurement (7). In 
adults, and more so in children, there is no consensus on what threshold 
level of AHI best identifies “affection,” with levels of 5, 10, 15, 20, 
or 30 used in different studies and clinical settings (reviewed in [10]). 
It is clear that such thresholds need to be modified according to the 
method of monitoring and definitions of hypopnea (10). For this report, 
we chose an AHI threshold of 10 to identify a group with clearly 
increased apneic activity (SDB cases). This threshold is higher than 
what is often considered abnormal in clinical settings (. 5) and, thus, 
probably identifies a group with at least a moderate degree of SDB. 
Support for this threshold is derived from our previous work, which 
has shown that children with an AHI at least this high have significantly 
more symptoms of SDB (habitual snoring, nocturnal gasping/ 
snorting, and sleepiness) than do children with lower AHIs (11). An 
AHI level , 5 was chosen to identify a control group with “minimal” 
or no SDB. To minimize misclassification, subjects with AHI levels 
between 5 and 10 were not included in analyses in which SDB was the 
outcome variable (n 5 35). 

Statistical Analyses 

Comparisons of the distribution of demographic and risk factors according 
to group membership (either index/control family or SDB 
present/absent) were made with unpaired t tests (continuous variables), 
with p values adjusted for unequal variances when appropriate, 
or chi square analyses (dichotomous outcomes). The tables present 
continuous variables as means 6 standard deviations (SDs) or as me


dians and the interquartile values (for non-normally distributed values). 
The p values for AHI and BMI were based on analyses of their 
natural logarithms, the distributions of which approximated normality. 
To account for the use of data on family members, in which outcomes 
may be correlated, a generalized linear model for correlated 
data was implemented using Generalized Estimating Equations (Proc 
Genmod, SAS PC 6.11; SAS Institute, Cary, NC) This method models 
the effects of covariates on marginal response probabilities using an 
appropriate link function (the logistic for binary data) (12). In these 
models, the family unit was considered the unit of clustering; additionally, 
an indicator variable was included to account for differences 
in recruitment sources (index family or control). 

RESULTS 

The distributions of physical and demographic characteristics 
and of risk factors in the study population are shown in Table 
1 for children recruited as members of index families and 
neighborhood control subjects. Approximately one half of the 
sample was female. Twenty-seven percent of the sample was 
African-American, reflecting the racial makeup of the greater 
Cleveland area. The majority of the remaining children were 
white (the others consisted of three Hispanics, one Asian, and 
14 “others”). Almost 13% of children had had a history of 
doctor-confirmed asthma and 5% reported persistent wheeze, 
percentages consistent with prevalence estimates for children 
of similar age and racial makeup (13). Subjects from the neighborhood 
control group and index families did not differ with 
respect to age, sex, or asthma prevalence. The frequency of 
obesity and sinus problems was greater in subjects from index 
families. SDB, based on an AHI of > 10, was observed in 
1.6% of children from neighborhood control families, and in 
8.4% of children from index families. The former is consistent 
with estimates of SDB based on two-sampling procedures 
from general population samples (14, 15). The latter is consistent 
with the 3- to 4-fold excess risk of SDB in members of 
families identified by a proband with SDB, as we have reported 
previously (16). Of the children with SDB, sleep apnea 
had been diagnosed in only two prior to study participation 
(i.e., the majority of children were found to have SDB as a 
result of their family’s study participation.) No child had obvi-

A comparison of demographic and anthropometric factors 
in groups without and with moderate SDB (AHI , 5 and > 10) 
is shown in Table 2. Groups did not differ in their sexual 
makeup. A larger proportion of children with moderate SDB 
than without SDB were African-American (56 versus 24%, 
p 5 0.001). Children with SDB also had greater BMIs and had 
larger neck circumferences than did children without SDB. A 
majority of children with SDB were from families with another 
affected member. Age did not differ between affected 
and unaffected groups. 

The distribution of upper and lower respiratory conditions 
in children with and without SDB is shown in Table 3. Children 
with SDB significantly more frequently reported or were 
reported to have had: usual cough, occasional wheeze, persistent 
wheeze, sinus problems, and doctor-diagnosed asthma. 
FEV1 and FVC levels, which were technically acceptable for 
only 163 children (mean age, 11.6 yr), tended to be lower in 
the group with SDB, but these differences were not statistically 
significant. 

Although obesity and sinus and respiratory problems were 
related to SDB, obesity was not significantly associated with 
either sinus problems (20% of nonobese children were reported 
to have sinus problems as compared with 25% of obese

had persistent wheeze compared with 3% of obese children). 

The results of the analyses that adjusted for the familial 
correlations within the data and also for recruitment sources 
(neighborhood control or index family) are presented in Table 

4. Significant associations exist between SDB and obesity, African 
American race, sinus problems, wheeze (occasional or 
persistent), cough, and doctor-diagnosed asthma. Obese children 
(defined by a BMI . 28) were four to five times more 
likely to have SDB than were nonobese children, and African 
Americans were approximately three and a half times more 
likely to have SDB than were other children. After additionally 
adjusting for obesity and African American race, significant 
relationships between SDB and respiratory symptoms 
and illnesses persisted. The strongest relationship was between 
SDB and usual cough; however, this symptom could be 
assessed only in children , 13 yr of age (the version of the 
questionnaire for older subjects did not contain this question). 
Persistent wheeze more strongly predicted SDB than occasional 
wheeze (adjusted odds ratio, 7.45 versus 3.29 for persistent 
and occasional wheeze, respectively). Children with doctor-
diagnosed asthma were estimated to be at an almost 4-fold 
increased risk for SDB than were nonasthmatic children. A 
history of sinus problems also increased risk of SDB approximately 
five fold. Age did not significantly predict SDB. 
Although sinus problems and asthma may occur in the 
same individual (17), a significant association between these 
two conditions was not seen in our data (sinus problems were 
reported by 27% of children with asthma and by 19% of the 
nonasthmatics; p . 0.25). To evaluate the extent to which 
upper (sinus) as compared with lower (asthma/wheeze) respiratory 
problems contributed to an excess risk of SDB, we 
assessed the extent to which each condition independently 
predicted SDB using a model that included obesity, race, recruitment 
source, sinus problems, and persistent wheeze as covariates, 
and SDB as the outcome. In this model, the adjusted 
odds ratio for sinus problems was 5.21 (95% confidence interval 
[CI], 1.66 to 16.12), and for persistent wheeze it was 8.76 
(95% CI, 1.28 to 60.27), suggesting that each condition independently 
predicted SDB. 

The relationship of race to SDB, independent of obesity is 
provided in Table 4 (second line, third and fourth columns). 
The relationship of race to SDB persisted when additionally 
considering the effects of asthma (odds ratio, adjusted for obesity 
and asthma, 3.49), sinus problems (obesity- and sinus-

adjusted odds ratio, 6.23), and persistent wheeze (obesity- and 
wheeze-adjusted odds ratio, 3.81). 

We also assessed whether a relationship between SDB and 
respiratory symptoms could be explained by current maternal 
(passive) smoke exposure. Forty-three percent of the mothers 
of children with SDB reported smoking at least one cigarette a 
day during the previous month as compared with 26% of the 
mothers of children without SDB. After adjusting for recruitment 
source, race, and obesity, and accounting for the clustered 
family data, no relationship between SDB and passive 
smoking was suggested (odds ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.89 to 2.80). 

Because there is uncertainty regarding the optimal cutoff 
values of BMI that identify obesity in children, analyses also 
were repeated for BMI as a continuous variable. This demonstrated 
that for each increase of 1 kg/m2 of BMI above the 
mean, risk of SDB increased by 12%. Use of BMI, rather than 
obesity defined as a binary variable, did not alter the results of 
the multiple adjusted logistic regression analyses presented in 
Table 4. 

Because the identification of hypopneas from the sleep 
records was dependent on observing a reduction in oxygen 
saturation with changes in breathing amplitude (from the 
thermistor or impedance channels), we assessed whether the 
higher AHIs in the asthmatic as compared with the nonasthmatic 
children could have resulted from differences in their 
levels of oxygen saturation. No differences were noted between 
the asthmatic and the nonasthmatic subjects in baseline 
oxygen saturation (97.7 6 1.3 versus 97.5 6 1.7, p 5 0.51 for 
asthmatics and nonasthmatics, respectively) or for average 
saturation with hypopneas/apneas (94.6 6 1.9 versus 94.8 6 
2.1, p 5 0.58). 

DISCUSSION 

Although recent epidemiologic studies have helped define the 
prevalence and risk factors for SDB in adults, relatively little 
is known regarding the distribution of SDB and risk factors 
for SDB in pediatric populations. The majority of reports of 
SDB in children are of patients referred for clinical evaluation, 
often because of profound sleepiness, behavioral problems, 
or cor pulmonale (18–22). Case series of symptomatic 
children emphasize the importance of adenotonsillar hypertrophy, 
nasal obstruction, facial anomalies, micrognathia, neuromuscular 
disease, or certain inherited syndromes as risk factors 
for SDB (20). These data, however, are likely biased by 
the selection processes that influence referral of symptomatic 
children for evaluation. In the current study, we were able to 
exploit the relatively high prevalence of SDB in family members 
of affected probands to study risk factors for SDB in a 
large sample of children with a wide range of apneic activity, 
the majority of whom were not referred for clinical evaluation. 
The findings from this sample derived from an urban community 
in the United States show that children and adolescents 

, 18 yr of age at increased risk for SDB include children who 
are obese, African Americans, and children with both upper 
and lower respiratory conditions. 
Susceptibility to SDB relates to the propensity for repetitive 
upper airway collapse. In any given person, this is determined 
by anatomic and neuromuscular factors that influence upper 
airway size and/or function. In adults, the strongest risk factors 
for SDB are male sex and obesity (23, 24). This study has demonstrated 
that, in children, sex does not significantly influence 
SDB risk. This is consistent with previous epidemiologic data 
that suggest no differences in snoring between boys and girls 
(15). Lack of a gender effect suggests that the sex differences 
seen in adults may be mediated by sex hormones (and their in


fluence on respiratory control and/or body fat distribution), 
which likely play a smaller role in prepubertal children. 

This study does demonstrate a significant association between 
obesity, as measured by the BMI, and increased neck 
circumference, with SDB. However, the magnitude of the effect 
is approximately one-half that which has been previously 
reported for adults (odds ratios approximately 5 compared 
with 10 to 12 in adults) (24, 25). A lesser effect of obesity in 
children may relate to relatively lower levels of obesity observed 
generally in children than in adults, or because obese 
children may be relatively “protected” because of other factors 
such as ventilatory control mechanisms. 

We previously reported increased SDB in African Americans 
as compared with whites, an effect that was most pronounced 
in the age group , 25 yr. In the current report, 
focused on children , 18 yr, we estimate that African Americans 
are approximately 3.5 times more likely to have SDB than 
a racial group consisting predominantly of white individuals. 
This effect is independent of both obesity and the respiratory 
risk factors described below. It is possible that some of the excess 
risk might be related to adenotonsillar hypertrophy, 
which is difficult to objectively quantify. Although we have attempted 
to systematically evaluate adenotonsillar hypertrophy 
from physical examination, we have been unable to validate 
its quantification, and, thus, chose not to report these 
data here. It is also possible that racial differences result from 
sociocultural differences in parental behaviors and the home 
environment that influence the sleep patterns of children, such 
as cosleeping (26). 

A focus of this report was to examine the relationship between 
upper and lower respiratory problems and SDB. We 
hypothesized that exposures or pathophysiologic processes 
that promote nasopharyngeal or airway inflammation influence 
SDB susceptibility. Data from an epidemiologic study 
from the United Kingdom indicated that the frequency of 
snoring was increased in asthmatics as compared with nonasthmatic 
subjects; this relationship was significant among adults 

, 40 yr of age (27). Larsson and colleagues (28) in Sweden 
found an increased prevalence of symptoms of SDB (snoring 
and apneas) in adults with chronic bronchitis when compared 
with a reference population. The Swedish study also reported 
an increased prevalence of snoring and apnea in subjects who 
reported wheezing and dyspnea. In children, questionnaire 
surveys have pointed out significant relationships of snoring 
with asthma and bronchitis (29, 30), and with allergic rhinitis 
and passive smoking (14, 29). Odds ratios, relating asthma and 
cough in snorers versus nonsnorers ranged from 2 to 3 (29). 
With the use of objective monitoring of breathing during sleep, 
we confirmed a significant association between upper and 
lower respiratory symptoms and asthma with SDB and demonstrated 
that these associations were independent of sex, 
obesity, family history, and race. Furthermore, with multivariate 
modeling, we were able to quantify the extent to which 
risk was attributable to upper versus lower respiratory problems. 
Our data suggest that symptoms of lower respiratory 
problems (wheeze or doctor-confirmed asthma) and a history 
of sinus problems both independently increase risk of SDB. 
Furthermore, risk of SDB in association with lower respiratory 
problems appears “dose-dependent,” in that children with 
persistent wheeze appear to be at greater risk than children 
with “occasional” wheeze. Additionally, these associations do 
not appear to be due to confounding by active maternal smoking. 
There are a number of potential pathophysiologic processes 
that could account for the relationship of upper and 
lower respiratory conditions with SDB. The association between 
sinus problems and SDB may relate to increased upper

airway resistance often found in children with inflamed or abnormal 
upper airways (31, 32). An increased upper airway resistance 
may lead to the generation of negative inspiratory 
pressure and intraluminal collapse, promoting hypopneas or 
apneas (32). 

The association of SDB with lower respiratory problems is 
probably more complex, and the direction of the predominant 
causal pathway is unclear. It is possible that SDB may cause or 
exacerbate airway hyperresponsiveness. With SDB, increased 
negative intrathoracic pressure is generated, which may promote 
gastroesophageal reflux, and, in turn, cause vagal stimulation 
and bronchoconstriction (33). Intrathoracic pressure 
swings and/or hypoxia also may increase cholinergic tone (potentiating 
bronchoconstriction) independent of esophageal re-
flux (34, 35). SDB may produce abnormalities in upper airway 
muscles and mucosa that may alter oropharyngeal reflexes, 
which potentiates bronchoconstriction (34, 35). A causative 
association between SDB and asthma is suggested by two 
studies that demonstrated improved asthma control in asthmatics 
with SDB or loud snoring that were treated with nasal 
continuous positive airway pressure (34, 36). The reverse 
causal pathway (asthma causing or exacerbating SDB) also is 
possible. Asthmatics frequently experience sleep disruption 
because of nocturnal bronchoconstriction (37, 38). Experimental 
sleep restriction has been reported to increase the frequency 
of apneas in snorers (39), possibly because of adverse 
effects of sleep deprivation on respiratory control. Finally, 
asthma and SDB may be linked because of common risk factors 
that promote airway inflammation and/or disturb neuromuscular 
control of breathing. The patency of the upper airway 
and overall bronchomotor tone may be influenced by 
common sleep-state-specific or circadian-rhythm-specific influences. 
Alterations in both bronchomotor tone and respiratory 
muscle function occur in REM sleep (37, 40), which also 
is the time when apneas are often the most pronounced. 

It is possible that children with SDB with an affected family 
member may differ from children in whom the disorder occurs 
in a “nonfamilial” form. The relative impact of the risk factors 
discussed in this report are likely different for children with 
congenital anomalies, severe underlying comorbidities, and 
neuromuscular diseases. Because SDB occurs more frequently 
as a familial than as a sporadic disorder (2), and because family 
history is a significant risk factor for SDB in children (odds 
ratio, 4 to 5) (11), the data from this study should be broadly 
generalizable to the majority of children in the community 
with elevated AHI levels. 

The measurement of the AHI in this study was based on a 
simple approach for collecting six channels of data in an unattended 
setting. This approach has been used extensively in epidemiologic 
studies to provide reliable estimates of the AHI 
that, in adults, correlates excellently with the AHI determined 
by conventional polysomnography (7). The optimal recording 
approach for sleep studies of children is an area of controversy. 
It is possible that the sometimes subtle changes in 
breathing pattern, in particular, periods of hypoventilation, 
that occur in children with SDB be identified best with inductance 
plethysmography and measurement of carbon dioxide 
(41). Recognizing that children may not desaturate as markedly 
as adults, we used a 2.5% level of desaturation rather 
than the 4% used in many adult studies (42) to help identify 
hypopneas. We also identified hypopneas on the basis of changes 
in the amplitude of either the impedance or the thermistor signal, 
an approach that may increase the sensitivity compared 
with use of a single channel to identify breathing changes. We 
previously demonstrated that this approach for monitoring 
and scoring successfully distinguishes children with and with


out SDB symptoms (11). Additionally, in our analyses, we did 
not use clinical criteria for identifying abnormality (which are 
variable across centers and specific to the recording apparatus). 
Rather, we maximized the contrast between children 
with and without “exposure” to SDB by creating two groups 
of children with clearly different AHI levels. A level of 10 
likely identifies children with at least moderate levels of SDB. 
A level of , 5, however, may include some children, who, if 
symptomatic, might be considered to have some degree of 
SDB. Redefining affection status differently, using a cutoff 
level of , 1 to define a normal population, and a level of . 5 
as an abnormal level, resulted in generally similar but somewhat 
less significant associations between SDB and the risk 
factors under consideration (e.g., odds ratios of 2.2 for wheeze, 

2.3 for race, and 6.1 for obesity). We also used a 10-s duration 
criterion to identify obstructed breathing events. This may differ 
from what is done in some pediatric sleep laboratories. It is 
possible that different recording approaches and SDB definitions 
may have identified a slightly different population of “affected” 
children. However, it seems unlikely that alternative 
definitions would result in qualitative differences in the findings 
of this study. 
Both the prevalence and the clinical significance of SDB to 
general health and development in children are poorly understood. 
We observed a frequency of SDB in our control sample 
of children of 1.6%. The results of the studies of Gislason and 
Benediktsdottir (15) and Ali and colleagues (43), which focused 
on small samples of children with multiple symptoms 
drawn from their larger population-based samples, also indicate 
that the minimum prevalence of SDB is in the range of 1 
to 3%. Clinical case series and limited epidemiologic data suggest 
that children with untreated SDB experience substantial 
morbidity. Even mild forms of SDB may be important in children, 
who may be particularly susceptible to adverse effects of 
sleep disruption and gas exchange abnormalities that may 
negatively impact growth and development. The findings from 
this study identify several risk factors for SDB in children, 
highlighting risk associated with obesity, African American 
race, and respiratory problems. Further understanding how 
these risk factors negatively impact upper airway patency may 
aid in elucidating the pathogenesis of SDB and optimizing 
treatment strategies.
