Abstract 
The facial patterns of 29 children under the age of 15 years with tonsil and/or adenoid and sleep 
disorder problems was analysed. The lateral-cephalograms of these patients was digitized in a 
zero-based computer program using Ricketts analysis to examine facial patterns. Results of the 
analysis were compared with the mean of the control group, n = 41 (9-year-old Japanese children). 
There were significant differences (P < 0.01–0.001) between the patient group and the 
control group when comparing the facial axis, lower facial height, mandibular arc, total facial 
height, and McNamara–Pogonion. The facial pattern of children with sleep breathing disorders 
was discovered to be the dolico facial pattern.

INTRODUCTION 

As adult patients with obstructive sleep apnea have a 
dolico facial pattern,1 we analysed the facial patterns 
of children with sleep breathing disorders to determine 
whether or not there was any correlation. 

SUBJECTS AND METHOD 

The study analysed 29 children under the age of 15 
years. Each child had habitual loud snoring and/or 
sleep apnea that had been noticed by the parents of 
the subjects. After taking patients’ cephalograms, we 
found enlarged tonsils and adenoids. We then scanned 
and digitized these for computer analysis (Fig. 1). 
The data were summarized and compared against the 
control group, n = 41.2 

RESULTS 

Five (17.2%) children had tonsil problems, seven 
(24.1%) had adenoid problems, and 17 (58.6%) had 
both tonsil and adenoid problems. There were signifi-

cant differences (P < 0.005) between the patient group 
and control group when comparing the facial axis 
(FX), lower facial height (LFH), mandibular arc, total 
facial height (TFH), and McNamara–Pogonion. Data 
analysis found that children with sleep breathing disorders 
had a dolico facial pattern (Table 1). 

DISCUSSION 

According to Ricketts analysis, there are three facial 
pattern classifications among orthodontic patients: (i) 
brachyo facial pattern (short face); (ii) mesio facial 
pattern (medium face: Japanese standard of facial axis 
is 86 ± 3); and (iii) dolico facial pattern (long face).3 
The facial pattern of the present population series 
was dolico facial pattern. 

The facial pattern of adults and children with sleep 
breathing disorders is the dolico facial pattern. However, 
the data of the children demonstrated a lesser 
degree of dolico facial pattern compared with the 
adults. (The data of adult patients with obstructive 
sleep apnea were as follows: FX 79.8, LFH 55.7, and 
TFH 69.8) When the tonsil and/or adenoid obstructs 
the airway, the negative pressure in the chest deforms 
it into a ‘funnel chest’ condition. This negative pressure 
in the chest causes the retraction of the tongue 
as well as the mandible, thereby possibly developing a

Figure 1. Cephalometric measurements. The cephalometric 
points and planes were: BA (basion), anterior margin of 
the foramen magnum; NA (nasion), junction of nasal and 
frontal bones; PT (pterygoid point), antero-inferior border 
of foramen rotundum; CC (center of cranium), intersection 
of cranial base plane and facial axis; O (orbitale), lower 
border of orbit; PR (porion), upper border of porus acusticus 
externus; POG (Pogonion), anterior border of symphysis 
of mandible; PM (protuberance menti), upper border of 
protuberance menti; GN (gnathion), intersection of facial 
plane and mandibular plane; XI, center of mandibular 
ramus; DC (condyle center), center of crossing part of 
condyle to cranial base plane; ANS, anterior nasal spine; A 
(point A), junction of alveolar bone of maxilla with anterior 
nasal spine; cranial base plane, BA–NA; Frankfort horizontal

mandibular plane, lower border of mandible; condylar axis, 
DC–XI; corpus axis, XI–PM; McNamara line, perpendicular 
to FH through NA.

The facial pattern of children with sleep breathing 
disorders was determined to be the dolico facial 
pattern (long face).
