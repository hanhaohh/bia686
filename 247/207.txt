Objective: To measure the impact of tonsillectomy 
and adenoidectomy (T&A) on children’s behavioral 
and emotional problems using a standardized assessment. 


Design: Prospective study. 

Setting: Tertiary care children’s hospital. 

Patients: Thirty-six children, aged 2 through 18 years, 
with symptoms of nighttime snoring, observed apneas, 
and daytime mouth breathing and physical examination 
results demonstrating 3+ or 4+ tonsils scheduled for 
T&A. 

Intervention: Parents completed a standard survey of 
their children’s symptoms of sleep apnea and a standardized 
measure of children’s competencies and problems, 
the Child Behavior Checklist for ages 2 through 3 years 
or 4 through 18 years, before T&A and 3 months postoperatively. 


Main Outcome Measure: The Child Behavior Checklist 
total problem score. 

Results: The preoperative Child Behavior Checklist total 
problem score was consistent with abnormal behavior 
for 10 children (28%). After T&A (n = 15), only 2 
scores were abnormal, but the change was not statistically 
significant. In contrast, the mean total problem score 
was 7.5 points lower after surgery (95% confidence interval, 
5.1-9.7), indicating a significant decrease (P.001, 
matched t test). 

Conclusions: This pilot study demonstrates a high prevalence 
(28%) of abnormal behavior in children undergoing 
T&A for chronic upper airway obstruction. Scores 
on a standardized measure of behavior improve following 
T&A, but larger studies with increased statistical 
power are needed to clarify the degree of improvement 
and its clinical importance.

HILDREN WITH obstructive 
sleep apnea syndrome 
(OSAS) usually are 
brought to medical attention 
because of nighttime 
breathing difficulties. Parents report symptoms 
of snoring, apneic pauses, choking, 
gasping, struggling to breath, restless sleep, 
unusual sleeping positions, and frequent 
awakenings.1-4 Although daytime sleepiness 
may be present, it is not a universal 
symptom in children compared with adults.5 
Pediatric OSAS has also been associated with 
cor pulmonale and right-sided heart failure,
3,4,6-8 systemic hypertension,3,9 failure to 
thrive,3,4,6 enuresis,3,10 and neurocognitive 
and behavioral abnormalities. 

The diagnosis of pediatric OSAS may 
be confirmed by polysomnography. However, 
there are few normative data available 
for polysomnography in children, 
sleep laboratories able to adequately study 

children are not widely available, and the 
studies are time-consuming and expensive. 
Thus, since tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy 
(T&A) is curative in most 
children, many children with suspected 
OSAS undergo T&A without preoperative 
polysomnography.11 

Although behavioral disturbances, including 
learning difficulties, attention disorders, 
hyperactivity, aggression, and antisocial 
behavior, have been reported in 
children with sleep apnea, there have been 
few studies using standardized behavioral 
assessments.3,6,12-16 Most studies have 
relied on parental reports of children’s behavior 
before and after treatment.6,14,17 The 
objective of this study was to determine 
the impact of T&A on the behavioral and 
emotional problems of children with OSAS 
or upper airway obstruction using a standardized 
assessment, the Child Behavior 
Checklist (CBCL).18,19

RESULTS 
Parents of 36 children completed the CBCL preoperatively. 
Patient demographics are presented in Table 1. 
The male-female ratio was 2:1, and the mean patient 
age was 4.6 years (range, 2-10 years). Most families 
were middle class or upper middle class (annual family 
income between $21 000 and $100 000),21 and the 
mean education level of the parent who completed the 
form was 2 years of postsecondary education. Fifteen 
parents returned the postoperative surveys. There 
were no clinical or demographic differences between 
those who returned the second survey and those who 
did not. 

Mean preoperative and postoperative symptom 
scores are presented in Table 2 and Table 3. One 
parent did not complete the standard questionnaire, 
and some responses were left incomplete by the parents. 
The postoperative scores were much lower than 
the preoperative scores, as would be expected after 
T&A. Entry T scores and score classifications for the 
total problem score, internalizing and externalizing 
groupings, and the individual syndrome scales are presented 
in Table 4. Sample size varied because some 
of the syndrome scales are applicable to only the 
CBCL/2-3 or the CBCL/4-18, and there were many 
incomplete responses for the total competence items. 

The total problem score was abnormal for 10 patients 
(28%), the internalizing group was abnormal for 3 
patients (8%), the externalizing group was abnormal 
for 9 patients (25%), and the individual syndrome 
scales were abnormal for between 0% and 20% of 
patients. Problem scales most affected were total competence 
(20%), sleep problems (17%), somatic complaints 
(11%), social problems (8%) and destructive 
behavior (8%). 

The change in T score and change in classification 
after T&A for the 15 patients with complete data 
are presented in Table 5. The mean total problem 
score was 7.5 points lower after surgery, resulting in a 
statistically significant decrease (P.001). Scores were 
also significantly lower after T&A for the internalizing 
subgroup and the individual syndrome scales of withdrawn, 
somatic complaints, anxious/depressed, attention 
problems, and thought problems. Sleep problems, 
destructive behavior, and total competence were not 
subjected to analysis because of the small numbers of 
patients in these groups. Although there were trends 
toward improvement, changes in classification were 
not significant for the total problem score or the individual 
syndrome scales. There were no significant relationships 
between family income and level of parent 
education and entry T scores or changes in classification 
postoperatively.

COMMENT 
This pilot study demonstrates a high prevalence (28%) of 
abnormal behavior in children undergoing T&A for OSAS 
or chronic upper airway obstruction. The CBCL scores significantly 
improved following T&A, although changes in 
classification (normal, borderline, or abnormal) were not 
statistically significant. Subclasses that showed significant 
improvement after T&A were withdrawn behavior, 
somatic complaints, anxious/depressed, attention problems, 
and thought problems. 

Although widely cited as a common complication 
of pediatric OSAS, neurocognitive and behavioral disturbances 
have mostly been inferred from case series 
where parents’ reports were the sole criteria for evaluation. 
Reports of improved behavior after treatment of 
OSAS have also largely consisted of anecdotal observations 
by parents and teachers. There have been only 4 
prior reports using standardized measures to assess the 
developmental and behavioral disturbances of children 
with OSAS.

pected sleep apnea and 66 controls. They administered 3 
subscales of the Conners’ Behavior Rating Scale to their 
parents and teachers. Only 7 children (all in the high-
risk group) had a detectable breathing disorder, but the 
high-risk children had significantly higher scores on the 
hyperactive and inattentive Conners’ subscales completed 
by both the parents and teachers and a significantly 
higher score on the aggressive subscale completed 
by the parents. In a follow-up study, Ali et al13 repeated 
their evaluation along with the administration of the 
continuous performance test, a measure of sustained 
attention in children, to 33 children with suspected 
sleep apnea who were scheduled for T&A. Of these 33 
children, 12 displayed a sleep and breathing disorder 
(SBD group) by video recording and pulse oximetry, and 
21 had normal sleep. Eleven of these children were 
matched by age and sex to those in the SBD group 
(snorer group). Ten other children without a history of 
snoring served as controls. After T&A, the SBD group 
showed a small but statistically significant improvement 
in all 3 behavior subscales of the Conners’ Parent Rating 
Scale, whereas the snorer group improved only on the 
hyperactivity subscale. There were no significant 
changes for any of the groups on the Conners’ Teacher 
Rating Scale. Following T&A, there were significant 
improvements on the continuous performance test by 
both the SBD and snorer groups. 

Rhodes et al15 administered the Wide Range Assessment 
of Memory and Learning to 14 morbidly obese children, 
5 with OSAS. The 5 children with OSAS had significantly 
lower scores on general memory, verbal 
memory, learning, and vocabulary. Gozal22 evaluated 297 
first-grade children whose school performance was in the 
lowest 10th percentile by a detailed OSAS questionnaire 
and a single night recording of pulse oximetry and transcutaneous 
partial pressure of carbon dioxide. Sleep-
associated gas exchange abnormalities were identified in 
54 children. Of these children, 24 underwent T&A, and 
their mean grades during the second grade increased significantly 
compared with the 30 children whose parents 
declined treatment.

forensic situations, and evaluation of problems related 
to child abuse.18,19 Our results agree with prior studies 
in emphasizing improvement in attention and thought 
problems after T&A but do not support improvement in 
aggressive or antisocial tendencies. 

Adults with OSAS have been shown to experience 
deficits in attention, memory, intellectual abilities, problem-
solving functions, and psychomotor skills using a 
wide range of validated tests.17,23,24 Many of these behavioral 
and neurocognitive functions improve following successful 
treatment.17,23 Recent studies have reported the 
higher incidence of traffic accidents in adult patients with 
OSAS.25 Although the physiologic mechanism by which 
OSAS produces its neurocognitive and behavioral effects 
is unknown, disrupted sleep patterns and hypoxemia 
are integral to their development.23,24 Although these 
defects are present in adults with sleep apnea, we cannot 
generalize these findings to children. 

Our pilot data suggest that behavioral, emotional, 
and neurocognitive difficulties are present in children with 
OSAS and improve after treatment. Further larger-scale 
work is needed to define the precise spectrum of these 
abnormalities, clarify the degree of improvement after 
treatment of OSAS, elucidate their clinical importance, 
and provide data to allow their early recognition.
