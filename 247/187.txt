Abstract 


Obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
(OSA) 
in 
children, 
characterized 
by 
hypoventilation 
secondary 
to 
upper 
airway 
obstruction, 
often 
results 
from 
tonsil 
and 
adenoid 
hypertrophy. 
Adenotonsillectomy 
is 
the 
standard 
therapy 
in 
this 
patient 
population. 
The 
immediate 
postoperative 
period 
is 
complicated 
occasionally 
by 
respiratory 
difficulties 
that 
may 
require 
intubation 
and 
mechanical 
ventilation. 
Recently, 
physicians 
have 
provided 
temporary 
airway 
support 
using 
continuous 
and 
bilevel 
positive 
airway 
pressure 
(BiPAP) 
devices. 
Reported 
complications 
of 
positive 
airway 
pressure 
devices 
include 
local 
abrasions 
to 
the 
nose 
and 
mouth; 
dryness 
of 
the 
nose, 
eyes, 
and 
mouth; 
sneezing; 
nasal 
drip, 
bleeds, 
and 
congestion; 
sinusitis; 
increased 
intraoccular 
pressure; 
non-compliance; 
and 
pneumocephalus. 
Subcutaneous 
emphysema 
following 
facial 
trauma, 
dental 
extractions, 
adenotonsillectomy, 
and 
sinus 
surgery 
has 
been 
reported. 
There 
is 
also 
a 
hypothetically 
increased 
risk 
of 
subcutaneous 
emphysema 
following 
the 
use 
of 
positive 
airway 
pressure 
ventilation 
in 
the 
tonsillectomy 
patient. 
Between 
January 
1997 
and 
July 
1998, 
1321 
patients 
underwent 
tonsillectomy 
and:or 
adenoidectomy 
at 
our 
institution. 
In 
reviewing 
the 
records 
of 
all 
pediatric 
intensive 
care 
unit 
admissions 
during 
that 
time 
period, 
we 
identified 
nine 
patients, 
of 
the 
1321, 
who 
required 
BiPAP 
postoperatively. 
Of 
these, 
four 
children 
were 
obese, 
four 
had 
preexisting 
neurological 
disorders, 
and 
one 
underwent 
endoscopic 
sinus 
surgery 
and 
adenoidectomy. 
Three 
children 
were 
asthmatic, 
and 
three 
were 
less 
than 
3 
years 
of 
age. 
Two 
obese 
children 
were 
discharged 
with 
home 
BiPAP, 
one 
of 
whom 
had 
been 
on 
BiPAP 
prior 
to 
surgery. 
All 
patients 
tolerated 
BiPAP 
without 
complications. 
This 
preliminary 
report 
suggests 
that 
BiPAP 
is 
a 
safe 
and 
effective 
method 
of 
respiratory 
assistance 
in 
the 
adenotonsillectomy 
patient 
with 
preexisting 
conditions 
who 
is 
predisposed 
to 
postoperative 
airway 
obstruction. 
Furthermore, 
with 
BiPAP, 
the 
risks 
of 
intubation 
and 
ventilator 
dependence 
are 
avoided.

1. 
Introduction 
Tonsillectomy 
and 
adenoidectomy 
(T&A) 
are 
among 
the 
most 
commonly 
performed 
surgical 
procedures. 
During 
the 
past 
20 
years, 
the 
number 
of 
T&As 
performed 
for 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
(OSA) 
and 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
has 
increased 
markedly 
[1]. 
It 
is 
estimated 
that 
5% 
of 
children 
snore 
habitually, 
and 
50% 
of 
habitual 
snorers 
have 
OSA. 
Up 
to 
63% 
of 
children 
undergoing 
adenotonsillectomy 
have 
a 
history 
of 
snoring, 
and 
59–75% 
of 
these 
children 
have 
OSA 
[2]. 
The 
standard 
therapy 
for 
OSA 
in 
children 
is 
adenotonsillectomy. 


The 
current 
use 
of 
strict 
indications 
for 
T&A 
has 
resulted 
in 
a 
sicker 
cross 
section 
of 
the 
population 
undergoing 
this 
procedure 
[3,4]. 
While 
improved 
anesthetic 
and 
surgical 
techniques 
have 
made 
T&A 
safer 
procedures, 
the 
possibility 
of 
serious 
complications, 
including 
respiratory 
failure, 
hemorrhage, 
and 
anesthetic 
sequelae, 
persists. 
Children 
with 
OSA 
have 
a 
significantly 
greater 
risk 
of 
developing 
severe 
respiratory 
compromise 
requiring 
medical 
intervention 
following 
adenotonsillectomy 
than 
children 
who 
undergo 
T&A 
for 
other 
indications 
[2,5,6]. 
There 
have 
been 
reports 
of 
subcutaneous 
emphysema 
following 
adenotonsillectomy 
that 
resulted 
in 
pneumomediastinum 
and 
pneumothorax 
[7,8]. 
The 
potential 
cardiorespiratory 
collapse 
which 
may 
result 
from 
such 
complications 
can 
be 
life-
threatening. 


Preoperatively, 
OSA 
is 
commonly 
treated 
in 
both 
children 
and 
adults 
with 
non-invasive 
positive 
pressure 
ventilation 
with 
good 
success 
and 
minimal 
complications. 
Recently, 
acute 
perioperative 
respiratory 
stabilization 
in 
cases 
of 
post-T&A 
respiratory 
compromise 
has 
been 
achieved 
with 
noninvasive 
positive 
pressure 
ventilation 
[2,6,9]. 


Continuous 
positive 
airway 
pressure 
devices 
(CPAP) 
and 
BiPAP 
are 
generally 
thought 
to 
be 
safe 
alternatives 
to 
intubation 
and 
mechanical 
ventilation. 
Complications 
of 
CPAP 
and 
BiPAP, 
including 
nasal 
drying 
and 
congestion, 
eye 
irritation, 
ulcerations 
on 
the 
nasal 
bridge, 
and 
non


compliance 
have 
been 
well 
recognized 
as 
limiting 
factors 
in 
the 
use 
of 
these 
devices 
[10–13]. 
Unusual 
complications 
of 
subcutaneous 
emphysema 
and 
pneumocephalus 
following 
the 
use 
of 
CPAP 
have 
been 
reported 
in 
adults. 
These 
complications 
are 
most 
likely 
the 
result 
of 
air 
dissecting 
through 
a 
defective 
mucosal 
and 
soft-tissue 
barrier 
and 
facilitated 
by 
the 
positive 
pressure 
from 
CPAP 
[11–13]. 
We 
performed 
a 
preliminary 
review 
of 
the 
use 
of 
BiPAP 
in 
T&A 
patients 
at 
our 
institution 
to 
determine 
its 
safety 
and 
efficacy. 
This 
was 
undertaken 
because 
of 
concerns 
regarding 
the 
potential 
risk 
of 
subcutaneous 
emphysema, 
pneumomediastinum, 
and 
pneumothorax, 
and 
the 
increasing 
use 
of 
noninvasive 
positive 
pressure 
ventilation 
to 
support 
acute 
respiratory 
compromise 
immediately 
following 
surgery. 


2. 
Methods 
A 
total 
of 
1321 
children 
underwent 
tonsillectomy 
and:or 
adenoidectomy 
at 
our 
institution 
between 
1 
January 
1997 
and 
31 
July, 
1998. 
Pediatric 
intensive 
care 
unit 
(PICU) 
admissions 
during 
this 
time 
period 
were 
examined, 
and 
all 
patients 
admitted 
with 
a 
diagnosis 
of 
respiratory 
compromise 
were 
identified. 
Those 
patients 
who 
had 
undergone 
tonsillectomy 
and:or 
adenoidectomy 
and 
were 
admitted 
to 
the 
PICU 
for 
respiratory 
compromise 
were 
selected 
for 
review 
for 
this 
study. 
Nine 
of 
the 
1321 
patients 
were 
found 
to 
have 
respiratory 
compromise 
following 
surgery, 
and 
required 
ventilatory 
support 
with 
BiPAP. 
The 
indication 
for 
surgery 
in 
all 
of 
these 
patients 
was 
OSA. 
The 
charts 
of 
these 
nine 
patients 
were 
reviewed 
in 
detail. 


Patient 
age, 
weight, 
sex, 
craniofacial 
abnormalities 
and 
comorbid 
disease 
were 
noted. 
The 
surgical 
technique 
in 
all 
cases 
was 
Bovie 
cautery 
for 
tonsillectomy. 
Operative 
time 
did 
not 
vary 
significantly 
in 
the 
nine 
patients, 
and 
there 
were 
no 
intraoperative 
complications. 
There 
were 
no 
anesthesia 
complications.

tution, 
and, 
therefore, 
were 
not 
included. 
Respiratory 
compromise 
was 
diagnosed 
by 
the 
otolaryngologist 
or 
the 
anesthesiologist. 
The 
need 
for 
respiratory 
support 
with 
BiPAP 
was 
identified 
by 
the 
intensivist. 


3. 
Results 
Of 
the 
nine 
patients 
identified 
for 
the 
study, 
eight 
underwent 
T&A, 
and 
one 
underwent 
functional 
sinus 
surgery 
with 
adenoidectomy. 
Four 
of 
the 
patients 
were 
obese. 
One 
child 
had 
Prader–Willi 
syndrome, 
mental 
retardation, 
asthma, 
and 
mitral 
valve 
insufficiency, 
and 
required 
home 
BiPAP 
upon 
discharge 
from 
the 
hospital. 
Four 
of 
the 
nine 
children 
had 
underlying 
neurologic 
disorders, 
including 
mental 
retardation:cerebral 
palsy 
(MRCP) 
(two 
children), 
seizures, 
and 
encephalopathy. 
Reactive 
airway 
disease 
prior 
to 
surgery 
was 
present 
in 
four 
children. 
Three 
children 
were 
less 
than 
three 
years 
of 
age. 
One 
child 
required 
BiPAP 
for 
OSA 
for 
one 
month 
prior 
to 
surgery. 
This 
child 
continued 
to 
require 
BiPAP 
subsequent 
to 
discharge 
from 
the 
hospital. 
Only 
one 
child 
had 
no 
known 
comorbid 
disease; 
her 
only 
risk 
factor 
for 
the 
development 
of 
postoperative 
respiratory 
compromise 
was 
her 
young 
age 
of 
2 
years. 


All 
children 
tolerated 
BiPAP 
without 
significant 
complications. 
One 
child 
refused 
to 
wear 
the 
Bi-
PAP 
mask 
after 
the 
first 
4 
h, 
by 
which 
time 
he 
was 
able 
to 
be 
managed 
with 
oxygen 
support 
via 
nasal 
cannula. 
Bilevel 
positive 
airway 
pressure 
requirements 
ranged 
from 
4 
to 
6 
h 
for 
one 
child 
to 
long-term 
home 
BiPAP 
in 
another. 
The 
patients 
were 
monitored 
in 
the 
PICU. 
In 
six 
of 
the 
nine 
cases, 
the 
children 
were 
discharged 
home 
with 
no 
further 
need 
for 
respiratory 
support. 
Two 
children 
required 
home 
BiPAP 
postoperatively. 
One 
of 
these 
patients 
had 
Prader–Willi 
syndrome; 
the 
other 
had 
severe 
sleep 
apnea 
requiring 
home 
BiPAP 
prior 
to 
surgery. 
One 
child 
required 
long-term 
home 
oxygen 
therapy 
but 
did 
not 
need 
positive 
pressure 
ventilatory 
assistance. 


There 
was 
no 
evidence 
of 
subcutaneous 
emphysema 
in 
any 
of 
the 
patients, 
despite 
treatment 
with 
BiPAP 
immediately 
following 
surgery. 
Clinical 
features 
identified 
previously 
as 
increasing 
the 
risk 
of 


postoperative 
respiratory 
compromise 
in 
OSA 
patients 
were 
consistent 
with 
our 
patient 
population. 
These 
features 
included 
obesity, 
young 
age, 
craniofacial 
abnormalities, 
and 
comorbid 
disease 
[2,3,5,6]. 


4. 
Discussion 
Subcutaneous 
emphysema, 
pneumomediastinum, 
and 
pneumothorax 
may 
complicate 
T&A. 
Subcutaneous 
air 
resulting 
from 
tonsillectomy 
is 
postulated 
to 
infiltrate 
through 
a 
disruption 
of 
the 
epithelial 
mucosal 
layer 
in 
the 
oropharynx. 
Alternatively, 
it 
may 
result 
from 
endotracheal 
tube 
trauma 
to 
the 
laryngotracheal 
tree. 
Once 
air 
is 
trapped 
in 
the 
soft-tissue 
spaces, 
it 
may 
dissect 
along 
the 
fascial 
planes 
of 
the 
neck, 
mediastinum, 
and 
abdominal 
wall 
[14]. 
While 
the 
clinical 
course 
of 
subcutaneous 
emphysema 
and 
pneumomediastinum 
is 
generally 
self-limited 
and 
benign, 
there 
is 
the 
potential 
for 
life-threatening 
cardiorespiratory 
consequences. 
Pneumothorax 
has 
been 
reported 
in 
50% 
of 
patients 
with 
pneumomediastinum 
[13]. 
Tension 
pneumomediastinum 
resulting 
in 
compression 
of 
the 
heart 
by 
accumulated 
mediastinal 
air 
may 
cause 
massive 
decreases 
in 
cardiac 
output 
and 
circulatory 
arrest. 
Impedance 
of 
pulmonary 
vascular 
flow 
by 
air 
within 
the 
vascular 
sheaths 
may 
lead 
to 
additional 
cardiorespiratory 
complications 
[14]. 
The 
possibility 
of 
acute 
airway 
obstruction 
due 
to 
massive 
amounts 
of 
retropharyngeal 
subcutaneous 
emphysema 
must 
be 
recognized. 
Lastly, 
some 
important, 
although 
not 
life-threatening, 
complications 
of 
subcutaneous 
cervical 
air 
are 
eustachian 
tube 
dysfunction, 
serous 
otitis 
media, 
and 
hearing 
loss. 
When 
air 
dissects 
along 
the 
peritubular 
fascial 
planes 
and 
movement 
of 
palatal 
muscles 
is 
limited, 
aeration 
of 
the 
middle 
ear 
may 
be 
compromised 
[12]. 


Once 
a 
stabilized 
airway 
is 
assured, 
management 
of 
this 
complication 
involves 
conservative 
therapy 
including 
time, 
reassurance 
of 
the 
patient 
and 
family, 
and 
avoidance 
of 
actions 
that 
may 
exacerbate 
or 
potentiate 
subcutaneous 
air. 
Avoiding 
Valsalva’s 
maneuvers, 
which 
may 
increase 
alveolar 
pressures 
and 
cause 
alveolar 
rupture, 
may 
be 
achieved 
with 
cough 
suppressants, 
stool

softeners, 
analgesics, 
and 
bed 
rest. 
Increased 
positive 
pressure 
in 
the 
oropharynx, 
as 
occurs 
with 
CPAP 
and 
BiPAP, 
may 
need 
to 
be 
limited 
to 
prevent 
exacerbation 
of 
the 
subcutaneous 
air. 


The 
increasing 
number 
of 
T&As 
performed 
for 
OSA 
also 
increases 
the 
risks 
of 
postoperative 
respiratory 
compromise. 
Preoperative 
identification 
of 
high-risk 
patients 
with 
obesity, 
age 
less 
than 
2 
years, 
craniofacial 
abnormalities, 
neuromuscular 
disorders 
such 
as 
MRCP, 
and 
preoperative 
BiPAP 
support 
is 
essential 
in 
the 
preparation 
for 
management 
of 
postoperative 
complications. 
While 
there 
are 
many 
options 
for 
the 
management 
of 
respiratory 
compromise, 
we 
have 
found 
BiPAP 
to 
be 
a 
safe 
alternative 
to 
intubation. 
The 
BiPAP 
system 
provides 
a 
noninvasive 
means 
of 
delivering 
ventilatory 
assistance 
to 
a 
spontaneously 
breathing 
patient. 
It 
has 
been 
proven 
useful 
in 
improving 
ventilation 
and 
oxygen 
saturation 
in 
both 
chronic 
and 
acute 
respiratory 
failure 
[9,15,16]. 
This 
device 
may 
obviate 
the 
need 
for 
and 
prevent 
the 
associated 
physical 
and 
psychological 
trauma 
and 
complications 
of 
translaryngeal 
intubation. 
Patients 
may 
communicate 
verbally, 
cough, 
and 
swallow 
independently 
while 
on 
BiPAP. 
All 
nine 
postoperative 
patients 
treated 
by 
this 
method 
and 
reviewed 
in 
this 
study 
had 
positive 
responses 
with 
no 
complicating 
events. 
These 
patients 
were 
all 
monitored 
in 
the 
PICU 
during 
the 
immediate 
postoperative 
period 
while 
on 
BiPAP. 
This 
pilot 
study 
suggests 
that 
BiPAP 
is 
a 
safe 
and 
effective 
means 
of 
managing 
perioperative 
respiratory 
compromise 
in 
the 
T&A 
patient. 
Close 
monitoring 
of 
these 
patients 
for 
evidence 
of 
subcutaneous 
emphysema 
and 
its 
associated 
morbidities 
is 
necessary. 
A 
heightened 
awareness 
in 
physicians 
managing 
the 
post-T&A 
patient 
on 
BiPAP 
is 
essential, 
as 
the 
increased 
risk 
of 
subcutaneous 
emphysema 
due 
to 
both 
the 
surgical 
procedure 
and 
the 
use 
of 
positive 
pressure 
ventilation 
may 
result 
in 
severe, 
life-threatening 
complications.
