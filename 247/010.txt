One of the most frequently encountered conditions associated 
with obesity is sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). In adults, the 
risk of SDB increases by 1.14 for every unit increase in body mass 
index (BMI) (1). In the pediatric population, the risk for developing 
SDB is fourfold greater in obese children than in children 
who are not obese (2). Although the prevalence of SDB in all 
children is believed to range from 2 to 3% (3–5), the prevalence in 
adolescents who are morbidly obese exceeds 50% (6, 7). Obesity 
is therefore strongly associated with abnormal upper airway control 
during sleep across all age groups. 

Adenotonsillectomy, the first line of treatment in the management 
of childhood SDB, is the most commonly performed 
surgical procedure in children. The annual rate of adenotonsillectomy 
in children aged 0 to 14 years ranges from 19 per 10,000 
in Canada to 115 per 10,000 in the Netherlands (8). At least half 
of these procedures are performed to relieve symptoms of SDB. 
In the first few weeks after adenotonsillectomy, obese children 
with SDB have a less favorable response to surgery than lean 
children. However, neither the long-term outcome nor the fac

Scientific 
Knowledge

the 
Subject 


The current practice is to treat children with sleep-disordered 
breathing (SDB) by adenotonsillectomy without clear 
guidelines for postoperative follow-up to assess recurrence. 

What 
This 
Study 
Adds 
to 
the 
Field 


Three clinical parameters confer independent increased risk 
for high recurrence of SDB after adenotonsillectomy: gain 
velocity in BMI, obesity, and being African American. 
Rapid body mass index gain is an independent risk for 
recurrence after adenotonsillectomy. Recurrence is associated 
with an increase in blood pressure that is independent of 
body mass index. 

tors that contribute to recurrence of the disorder after adenotonsillectomy 
are clearly understood. Moreover, the impact of 
recurrence of SDB on important cardiovascular risk factors, 
such as blood pressure (BP), has never been examined. 

Research investigating the relationship between adiposity 
and SDB has thus far focused on mechanical disease mechanisms, 
such as the volume of parapharyngeal and abdominal fat 
(9–11). These disease mechanisms do not, however, fully explain 
the absence of SDB in approximately half of children with 
morbid obesity. It also remains unclear why for the same level 
of obesity some children have recurrence of SDB after adenotonsillectomy 
whereas others have normal respiratory patterns. 

Obesity is associated with an increase in endocrine and 
inflammatory activities of fat cells, many of which may modulate 
respiratory control (12–14). Several studies have demonstrated 
that the inflammatory consequences of obesity and its cardiovascular 
morbidity are influenced by the rate of weight gain over time 
independent of actual weight (15–19). Thus, the degree of adiposity 
and rate of weight gain may reflect different disease processes 
(20, 21). Together, these disease processes contribute to 
the overall obesity-related morbidity. 

In this study, we sought to determine the 1-year recurrence 
of SDB in children after adenotonsillectomy and its impact on 
blood pressure. We investigated a novel construct, where two 
different measures of growth, BMI and gain velocity in BMI, 
might have independent effects on upper airway control during 
sleep. We tested the hypothesis that, independent of the degree 
of obesity, the rate of gain in BMI increases the risk of recurrence 
of SDB, which in turn contributes to elevation of BP 1 
year after treatment by adenotonsillectomy.

treat symptoms of SDB had been made by their otolaryngologist 
before enrollment in the study. Children were evaluated at four time 
points: before undergoing adenotonsillectomy, and 6 weeks, 6 months, 
and 1 year after adenotonsillectomy. At each time point, they underwent 
polysomnographic evaluation and physical examination, which 
included documentation of weight, height, BP, and BMI. 

Healthy children matched for age and sex were enrolled as a comparison 
group. The reasons for studying a group of healthy children were 
as follows: (1) to derive a cutoff for recurrence of SDB at 1 year defined 
as the level of apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) that exceeds by 1 SD the 
average AHI measured from the comparison group and (2) to determine 
the trend and variability of AHI over the duration of the study. Children 
in this group were monitored for 1 year and received three 6-month evaluations. 
The protocol was approved by the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital 
institutional review board. Informed consent was obtained from 
the parents or legal guardian of each child, and assent was obtained 
from children older than 7 years. 

Subjects 


Children ranging in age from 7 to 13 years with nightly snoring and 
hypertrophy of the tonsils and adenoids were prospectively recruited for 
this study. Inclusion criteria for children with SDB were as follows: (1)an 
agreed upon decision between the otolaryngologist and the child’s 
parents to undergo adenotonsillectomy to treat symptoms of obstructive 
breathing during sleep and (2) a polysomnogram consistent with the 
diagnosis of SDB. The comparison group consisted of age-and sex-
matched healthy children without history of obstructive breathing during 
sleep. To retain children in the comparison group, their polysomnogram 
should have been without evidence of SDB or alveolar hypoventilation 
during sleep. Exclusion criteria for both groups were the presence of 
chronic medical conditions and genetic syndromes as determined by 
history and physical examination. 

Polysomnography 


Polysomnography studies were performed overnight according to the 
American Thoracic Society standards (22, 23), using computerized 
systems (Telefactor; Grass, West Warwick, RI). The interpretation of 
polysomnography was performed by an investigator (R.A.) who was 
blinded as to which group subjects were enrolled in, their medical and 
demographic characteristics, and the time sequence of the study. All 
investigators including the otolaryngologist were blinded to the results 
of the study. However, results were communicated to the managing 
otolaryngologist only when baseline AHI was 15 events or more per 
hour. This level of AHI was used by the managing otolaryngologist 
as an indication to perform the surgery at the main campus of the 
Cincinnati Children’s Hospital rather than in a satellite facility and to 
admit the child postoperatively for overnight observation. 

SDB was defined as an obstructive AHI of more than 1 event per hour 
of sleep. The recurrence of SDB was defined as an AHI of 3 events or 
more per hour of sleep. This level was derived from the comparison 
group population by calculating the level that exceeded by 1 SD the mean 
value of the comparison group at 1 year. 

BP 
and 
BMI 
Slope 
Measurements 


BP measurements were the average of three readings obtained after 
a minimum rest period of 5 minutes with the subjects in the sitting 
position. BP was measured before and 6 and 12 months after adenotonsillectomy. 
BMI gain velocity for the SDB group was calculated using 
BMI from the four visits as the slope of a linear regression line predicting 
BMI from time at baseline, scaled as change in BMI per year. BMI slope 
for the comparison group was derived from three time points. 

Statistical 
Analysis 


Exact tests were used to measure differences between the SDB groups in 
rates for dichotomous variables. Differences in AHI levels were tested 
with the Wilcoxon nonparametric test, whereas differences in age, BMI, 
and BP were tested with t 
tests. Comparisons between two time points 
within the SDB group for BP were performed by paired t 
tests. A two-
tailed P 
value of less than 0.05 indicated statistical significance for all tests. 

Three sets of multivariable logistic models predicting an AHI of 
3 or more at the 1-year follow-up were constructed. The independent 
variables common to all models included age, sex, race, and BMI slope. 
The three sets of models differed in whether BMI at baseline, BMI at 
1 year, or a mean BMI was entered into the model. In each of the models, 
all possible two-way interactions between either BMI variables or any of 
the demographic covariates were examined. All P 
values and confidence 
intervals derived from these logistic regressions were likelihood based. 
For each model, the C-statistic, or area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve, was noted. Reduced models were estimated by 
removing one predictor at a time from the full model, and noting the 
c-statistics. C-statistics for the reduced models were compared to assess 
the relative contributions of different predictors to the overall predictive 
power of the full model. 

A model that included age, race, BMI, and AHI at 1 year was constructed 
to predict the final systolic and diastolic BP. 

RESULTS 


Ninety-seven children, 62 with SDB and 35 in the comparison 
group, were enrolled in the study. After the initial evaluation, 22 
children with SDB and 5 control subjects elected to withdraw 
from the study. A comparison of age, sex, race, BMI, AHI, and 
systolic and diastolic BP showed only a higher diastolic BP (62 6 
8 
vs. 55 6 
5 mm Hg, P 
5 
0.03) in children with SDB who completed 
the study compared with those who withdrew. Children in the 
comparison group who completed the study had a higher BMI 
(19 6 
4 vs. 16 6 
2, P 
5 
0.03) compared with those who withdrew. 
Seventy children completed the whole protocol. Forty met the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria for SDB and 30 made up the comparison 
group. Eighteen of 40 children with SDB and 3 of 30 in the 
comparison group had a BMI greater than the 95th percentile at 
baseline. Half the SDB group had an AHI more than 3 at the 
1-year evaluation (Table 1). Among those who had an AHI

greater than 3 at 1 year, six (30%) had an AHI higher than their 
baseline value. In the same time period, 2 of the 30 children (7%) 
in the comparison group developed SDB, one child was obese and 
one nonobese. 

Change 
in 
AHI 
after 
Adenotonsillectomy 


The AHI of children with SDB decreased significantly from a 
mean of 9.2 6 
14 at baseline to 1.4 6 
2 at 6 weeks after surgery 
(P 
< 
0.001). There was no difference in AHI measured at 6 weeks 
between those who ultimately had recurrence of SDB after 1 year 
and those who did not (Figure 1). The 6-week AHI showed no 
correlation with the AHI measured preoperatively or the AHI 
measured at 6 months and 1 year after surgery. 

In the period from 6 months to 1 year postoperatively, both 
obese and nonobese children showed a trend toward increasing 
AHI over time (Table 2). A positive correlation was measured 
between preoperative AHI and that measured at 6 months (r 
5 
0.5, P 
, 
0.01) and 1 year (r 
5 
0.5, P 
, 
0.01) after surgery. These 
results suggest that preoperative polysomnography findings predict 
the 1-year outcome of surgery regardless of the short-term 
improvement seen at the 6-week postoperative time point.

Year 
after 
Adenotonsillectomy 


Children with an AHI of 3 or more at 1 year were more likely to 
have an accelerated BMI gain, to be more obese, to be African 
American, and to have more severe SDB at baseline (Table 1). 
The rate of BMI gain, measured as BMI regression slope, was 
significantly larger in children with recurrence versus those 
without recurrence of SBD (Table 1). 

Multivariable 
Logistic 
Regression 


The independent effect of the BMI regression slope on the risk 
of SDB recurrence after adenotonsillectomy was demonstrated 
through multivariable logistic regression (Table 3). There were 
no significant two-way interactions between predictors in any of 
the models predicting SDB recurrence. Whether the assessment

of BMI in the model was that from baseline, at 1 year, or from 
a mean BMI over 1 year, recurrence was significantly predicted 
by African-American race, BMI, and the BMI slope (Table 3). 
These same variables were significant predictors when the nonsignificant 
variables, age and sex, were removed (results not shown). 
The c-statistics for the reduced models suggest that race, BMI, 
and BMI gain provided roughly equal amounts of predictive 
power to the models. Odds ratios for SDB recurrence, adjusted 
for other variables in the models, were approximately 1.4 for each 
unit of BMI, 4 to 6 for each unit of BMI change per year, and 15 for 
African-American race (Table 3). These results demonstrate the 
independent effect of rate of BMI gain on the long-term risk for 
recurrence of SDB after adenotonsillectomy. 

Relationship 
of 
Recurrence 
of 
SDB 
to 
Systemic 
BP 


In the comparison group, there was no significant change in 
systolic or diastolic BP over the course of the study. In children 
with SDB, a decline in diastolic BP was evident at 6 months after 
surgery (Figure 2). This significant trend was observed in children 
who had no recurrence and also in those who ultimately had 
recurrence at the 1-year evaluation. In the latter group, there was 
a significant increase in systolic BP compared with preoperative 
levels and compared with those who did not have recurrence. In 
a model that included age, race, BMI, and AHI at the end of the 
follow-up period, AHI was a significant predictor of systolic (P 
5 
0.03) and diastolic (P 
5 
0.0004) BP 1 year after adenotonsillectomy. 

Evaluation 
for 
Recurrence 
of 
Hypertrophy 
of 
the 
Adenoids 
after 
Adenotonsillectomy 


Subjects who had recurrence of SDB were invited to undergo 
a clinical evaluation and/or airway radiograph. In contrast to 
surgical removal of adenoidal tissue, the removal of the tonsils is 
complete and therefore regrowth of the tonsils does not occur. 
Thus, the objective of the evaluation was to assess for regrowth of 
the adenoids. Eleven subjects had an airway radiograph; two of 
these subjects had regrowth of the adenoids. In one case, the 
adenoids were nonobstructive and in another case the adenoids 
were obstructive. Nine subjects did not have evidence of regrowth 
of the adenoids. The remaining nine subjects who had recurrence 
of SDB did not receive an evaluation. The reasons were change in 
address or a refusal to pursue further evaluation because of the 
significant improvement in their AHI after surgery. 

DISCUSSION 


Several new observations with important implications for clinical 
practice and for understanding the pathogenesis of SDB in 
children emerged from this study. We report for the first time 
the longitudinal outcome of adenotonsillectomy in healthy children, 
the important influence of BMI gain velocity and African-
American race on recurrence of SDB, and the longitudinal changes 
in BP associated with the recurrence of SDB.

An important observation made in this study relates to the 
timing of the assessment of SDB after adenotonsillectomy. To 
date, most postadenotonsillectomy outcome studies have focused 
on the assessment of SDB 6 to 16 weeks after surgery (24–26). 
Resolution of SDB during this window of time was usually 
interpreted as a cure for the disorder. However, the high rate of 
recurrence of SDB that we observed 1 year after surgery in both 
obese and nonobese children indicates that SDB is a chronic 
condition. In fact, the absence of a significant correlation between 
the 6-week postoperative AHI and AHI measured at any earlier 
or later time speaks to the limited predictive value of the 6-week 
evaluation. Furthermore, large BP increases in children who had 
recurrence of SDB and the independent association of AHI with 
both 1-year systolic and diastolic BP point to the potential 
morbidity of unrecognized residual SDB after adenotonsillectomy. 
In view of our findings, it would be clinically prudent to 
extend the traditional 6-week follow-up, commonly used in clinical 
practice, to at least a 1-year follow-up. 

In our study population, adenotonsillectomy was associated 
with partial to complete resolution of SDB in both obese and 
nonobese children. Although in obese children the 1-year AHI 
decreased significantly from that measured preoperatively, the 


number of obese children with an AHI greater than 3 increased 
from 67 to 79%. On one hand, these findings appear to indicate 
the beneficial effect of adenotonsillectomy in all children with 
SDB independent of BMI. On the other hand, they suggest the 
presence of a subset of children who are refractory to a long-term 
benefit, and in fact susceptible to progression of SDB despite 
adenotonsillectomy. Although children who were obese at baseline 
were more likely to be refractory to the benefit of adenotonsillectomy, 
there was an additional and independent risk 
of SDB reoccurrence due to the rate of BMI gain during the 
duration of the study. These results highlight the differential 
disease mechanisms between those due to obesity and those due 
to the rapid change in body composition associated with accelerated 
BMI gain. 

Different obesity-related conditions and parameters, as distinct 
mediators of disease morbidity, have emerged from studies 
of pathways linking obesity to abnormal glucose homeostasis and 
cardiovascular diseases. Among these conditions is adiposity 
rebound, defined by the age after infancy at which BMI starts to 
rise and measured as BMI gain from birth to childhood. The role 
of BMI gain from infancy to childhood in obesity-related morbidity 
was highlighted by Bhargava and colleagues (27). In their

study of 1,492 young adults, they examined the relation of serial 
changes in childhood BMI to impaired glucose tolerance in young 
adulthood. Children, in whom impaired glucose tolerance or 
diabetes later developed, were characterized by a low BMI between 
birth and 2 years of age, a young age at adiposity rebound, 
and a sustained accelerated gain in BMI until adulthood. A 
similar association between rate of weight gain and the risk of 
cardiovascular disease in children and adults has been recently 
described (18, 19, 28). 

Our study, together with those noted above, regarding the 
independent role of BMI gain in disease development, clearly 
support the concept of BMI gain trajectory as an independent risk 
factor for SDB, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. The association 
of BMI gain with abnormal glucose homeostasis and 
markers of early atherosclerosis in children (15, 27) is similar to 
the trend we observed between BMI gain and risk for SDB after 
adenotonsillectomy. The similarity in these trends raises the 
important question of whether SDB is one link between a high 
rate of BMI gain during childhood and abnormal glucose homeostasis 
and cardiovascular disease in adulthood. 

In all regression models examined in our study, being African 
American increased the risk of recurrence of SDB after adenotonsillectomy. 
This observation identifies the racial differences in 
conferring the risk of developing SDB in children. 

A limitation of this study design is that it did not address the 
reproducibility of AHI in untreated children with SDB over a 1year 
period. Because measuring the reproducibility of AHI over 
a period of 1 year in children with varying degrees of severity of 
SDB would require withholding therapy, and is not ethically acceptable, 
we included a healthy control group, which was followed 
for the same duration as children with SDB. Although the findings 
derived from the comparison group do not necessarily reflect 
the reproducibility of AHI in children with SDB, they nevertheless 
demonstrate the small variation of this index over a period of 
1 year. 

Conclusions 


There is a high risk of recurrence of SDB in children 1 year after 
adenotonsillectomy that was associated with increasing BP. 
Gain velocity in BMI, being obese, and being African American 
increased the risk of recurrence of SDB 1 year after adenotonsillectomy. 
We advocate long-term follow-up of children with 
SDB, monitoring of BMI gain, and reevaluation of children who 
demonstrate rapid BMI gain, especially those who are African 
American.
