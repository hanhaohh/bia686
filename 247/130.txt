Summary. In 
adults, 
influence 
of 
body 
position 
on 
the 
occurrence 
of 
respiratory 
events 
during 
sleep 
is 
recognized, 
and 
increased 
numbers 
of 
respiratory 
events 
occur 
when 
the 
supine 
position 
is 
assumed.1–4 
In 
1985, 
Orr 
et

showed 
that 
body 
position 
did 
not 
influence 
respiratory 
events 
during 
sleep 
in 
children.5 
Recently, 
Fernandes 
do 
Prado 
et

showed 
that 
children 
had 
a 
lower 
obstructive 
apnea 
hypopnea 
index 
(AHI) 
in 
supine 
position.6 
Results 
of 
these 
two 
studies 
are 
different 
from 
others 
performed 
on 
adults. 
Moreover, 
upper

were 
not 
considered 
in 
these

The 
aim 
of 
the 
present

was 
to 
evaluate

PATIENTS AND METHODS 

Patients 

The sleep studies of 55 children with obstructive sleep 
apnea syndrome (OSAS) (apnea index (AI) >1) were 
retrospectively evaluated. Children whose body mass 
index (BMI) was higher than the 85th percentile were 
excluded. All of them had been referred to the Sleep 
Laboratory by the ENT Department because of snoring 
and/or a suspicion of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) from 
January–November 2001. 

Children who had slept less than 30 min in any body 
position (prone, supine, or lateral), and children who did 
not have detailed upper airway examinations, were excluded 
from the study. Children with congenital upper 
airway anomalies (e.g., micrognaty, macroglossy) were 
also excluded. Thirty-two children underwent statistical 
analyses. 

Polysomnographic Evaluation 

All individuals arrived at the Sleep Laboratory around 
9 PM, and the sleep studies began between 10–12 PM. 

All individuals were studied with Medilog MPA 
polysomnography (Oxford Medical Ltd., Oxon, UK). 
Only six channels were mounted to children. Breathing 
was monitored with chest and abdominal belts. Airflow 
was monitored by an oronasal thermistor. A finger-pulse 
oxymeter was used for monitorization of oxygen saturation 
and pulse monitoring. A microphone which was 
mounted over the inferior part of the trachea recorded 
breath sound. A body position sensor was mounted on the 
chest. The sleep technician followed patients’ behavior 
and confirmed sleep position from a double-sided window. 

. 
2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc. 
Relationships between respiratory events and body 
posture were established by Medilog MPA software. A 
physician experienced in polysomnographic records 
scored all records on screen manually. Accepted pediatric 
standards were used for scoring of respiratory events.7 The 
scorer had no knowledge of examinations of the children’s 
upper airways. 

Airflow cessation greater than or equal to two breaths’ 
duration was counted as apnea. Decrease in oxygen 
saturation of 3% or more was accepted as desaturation. 
Hypopnea was defined as qualitative reduction in thermistor 
airflow of more than 50% in the presence of 
paradoxical respiratory efforts, associated with desaturation 
>3%. Mean number of apneas and hypopneas per 
hour of study was defined as AHI. Mean number of 
desaturations per hour of study was defined as the oxygen 
desaturation index (ODI).

worse in supine posture.9 Moreover, sleep in the lateral 
position was recommended to adults as a therapeutic 
method (positional therapy). 

Cartwright et al.8 described positional OSAS as a 
subgroup of OSAS.8 They defined ‘‘positional patients’’ 
(PP) as those OSA patients in whom the AHI was at least 
twice as high in supine position as in lateral position. This 
description was used previously for adults. In children, 
there is no accepted description of positional patients. In 
our study, we interpreted two different descriptions: the PP 
description by Cartwright et al.,8 and the absolute majority 
of AHI. We modified the PP description for lateral and 
prone positions in children, because both lateral and prone 
positions were higher than supine position. 

In 37% of our group, AHI was higher in supine position 
than in nonsupine positions. But only 9% (n ¼ 
3) of the 
children were PP for supine position. In children, PPs for 
lateral position (28%) were more frequent than supine PP 
(9%). Nonpositional patients were frequently found 
among children. In adults, various authors previously 
demonstrated that PPs for supine position made up 50– 
60%.1–4 But there is no paper in the literature describing 
lateral positional patients in adult OSA. We showed that 
according to the description of Cartwright et al.,8 lateral 
PPs were more frequent in children, but there was no 
statistical difference. 

The relationship between sleep position and sudden 
infant death syndrome was investigated many times.10–12 
But in children with OSAS, the relationship between sleep 
position and AHI has rarely been investigated. Recently, 
Fernandes do Prado et al. demonstrated that children had a 
lower AHI in supine vs. prone position, and shorter apneas 
in supine position than on their sides.6 But they did not 
separate their groups according to upper airway anomalies. 
We agree with them that breathing in supine position 
is better than in lateral position in children with OSAS. But 
in children with hypertrophic tonsils and adenoid, the 
relationship between respiratory distress and sleep position 
is similar to that in adults. Their AHIs were worse 
when they were in supine position. Children with adenoid 
hypertrophy were very different from adults. Their AHIs 
were high in the lateral position. Even in 7 children with 
adenoid hypertrophy, AHIs were at least twice as high in 
the lateral position as in the supine position plus prone 

Thach and Stark wrote that children in prone or lateral 
position have flexion of their neck, which can lead to 
increased upper airway collapsibility.13 In another study, 
Ishikawa et al. showed that the prone position increases 
upper airway collapsibility.14 Unfortunately, in our study 
we did not record neck position, and prone PPs and children 
with their highest AHI in prone position were very low. 
Therefore, we cannot discuss the role of the prone position 
in children with obstructive sleep apnea. 

In many reviews of OSA, the relationship between sleep 
position and sleep apneas was due to the effect of gravity.15 
Gravity increases the apposition of the soft-palate uvula 
and tongue to the posterior airway wall. This effect is 
more severe when patients sleep in the supine position. In 
an adult series, the relationship between upper airway 
anatomy and sleep position was examined. Pevernagie and 
Shepard wrote that the PP retropalatal area was narrowed 
more than the non-PP retropalatal area.16 They also 
showed that the shapes of the two groups were different 
from each other: elliptical in the PP group, and circular in 
the non-PP group. 

Different from adults, obstruction is usually at the level 
of the adenoids in children.17 Gravity is less important in 
children with adenoid hypertrophy, compared to children 
with tonsil hypertrophy. We speculated that the adenoids 
are more fixed than tonsils, and are not affected by gravity. 
In supine position, tonsils move toward the back and 
become lodged in the upper airway. 

In the current study, we showed that supine position is 
better than lateral position in children with adenoid 
hypertrophy. But children with hypertrophic tonsils and 
adenoid are similar to adults, and they breathe worse when 
they sleep in supine position. These findings may support 
idea of gravity in the etiology of OSA.
