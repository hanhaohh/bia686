effect 
of 
polysomnography 
on 
pediatric

OBJECTIVE: 
We retrospectively investigated the effect 
and predictability of preoperative polysomnography 
(PSG) on the postoperative course of 
younger pediatric patients undergoing adenotonsillectomy. 
STUDY 
DESIGN 
AND 
SETTING: 
A retrospective chart 
review was performed for patients 3 years of age 
and younger who had undergone adenotonsillectomy 
between July 1997 and July 2002 at the 
Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin. 
RESULTS: 
Two hundred eighty-two patients were 
identified. Forty-three patients had preoperative 
PSG. No correlation between the severity of PSG 
results and postoperative course was identified. 
CONCLUSIONS: 
The role of PSG in upper airway 
obstruction and OSA remains controversial. This 
study suggests that although the complication rate 
may be higher in this younger population, these 
complications do not appear to have a large impact 
on their length of stay. 
SIGNIFICANCE: 
This study suggests that the 3-yearsand-
younger group, in the absence of other comorbidities, 
can safely undergo adenotonsillectomy 
without undergoing preoperative PSG. EBM

Sleep-disordered 
breathing 
is 
a 
common 
diagnosis 
in 
the 
pediatric 
population. 
Patients 
generally 
present 
with 
symptoms 
such 
as 
loud 
snoring, 
respiratory 
pauses, 
and 
mouth 
breathing. 
Physical 
examination 
often 
shows 
enlarged 
tonsil 
or 
adenoid 
tissue. 
In 
these 
children, 
adenotonsillectomy 
is 
often 
curative. 
In 
most 
cases, 
the 
decision 
for 
surgery 
is 
established 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
clinical 
history 
and 
physical 
exam. 
The 
gold 
standard 
for 
diagnosis 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
is 
polysomnog-

raphy 
(PSG). 
However, 
PSG 
is 
costly, 
time 
limiting, 
and 
often 
not 
readily 
available.1 
Furthermore, 
its 
value 
as 
a 
preoperative 
tool 
is 
controversial 
with 
regard 
to 
which 
patient 
groups 
require 
or 
benefit 
from 
preoperative 
PSG.2 


Several 
studies 
have 
addressed 
adenotonsillectomy 
and 
have 
identified 
populations 
at 
high 
risk 
for 
postoperative 
complications. 
These 
populations 
include 
children 
with 
craniofacial 
disorders, 
failure 
to 
thrive, 
neurological 
impairment, 
Down 
syndrome, 
obstructive 
sleep apnea, and aged 3 years or younger.3-7 Preoperative 
PSG 
and 
postoperative 
overnight 
observation 
has 
been 
recommended 
for 
these 
patients. 
Polysomnography 
has 
also 
been 
recommended 
for 
differentiating 
primary 
snoring 
from 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea.8,9 
In 
addition, 
tonsillectomy 
is 
often 
postponed 
in 
children 
aged 
3 
or 
younger 
because 
of 
reported 
increases 
in 
risks. 
Some 
authors 
believe 
that 
polysomnographic 
results 
are predictive of postoperative complications and 
postoperative course.3-5,7 This study attempts to retrospectively 
review 
the 
postoperative 
course 
in 
children 
3 
years 
of 
age 
and 
younger 
and 
to 
correlate 
this 
course 
with 
the 
severity 
of 
obstruction 
by 
diagnosis 
on 
preoperative 
PSG. 
We 
hypothesize 
that 
the 
severity 
of 
sleep-
disordered 
breathing 
or 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
(UAO) 
identified 
by 
PSG 
does 
not 
correlate 
well 
with 
the 
severity 
of 
postoperative 
complications 
and 
postoperative 
course. 


MATERIALS 
AND 
METHODS 


A 
search 
by 
procedure 
code 
identified 
all 
children 
who 
underwent 
tonsillectomy 
or 
adenotonsillectomy 
at 
The 
Children’s 
Hospital 
of 
Wisconsin 
between 
July 
1997 
and 
July 
2002. 
This 
data 
set 
was 
then 
limited 
to 
those 
children 
3 
years 
of 
age 
and 
younger 
who 
had 
procedures 
performed 
by 
attending 
surgeons 
or 
by 
a 
resident 
with 
attending 
supervision. 
The 
Children’s 
Hospital 
Institutional 
Review 
Board 
granted 
approval 
for 
this 
study. 


Data 
were 
extracted 
from 
each 
patient’s 
medical 
chart 
and 
included 
the 
following: 
preoperative 
PSG 
results, 
admitting 
diagnosis, 
surgeon, 
medical 
comorbidities, 
length 
of 
stay 
(LOS), 
postoperative 
complications, 
and 
associated 
interventions. 
In 
addition, 
postoperative 
progress 
notes 
were 
reviewed 
to 
identify 
the 
general 
postoperative 
course 
for 
each 
patient 
as 
well 
as 
any 
information 
that 
could 
be 
attributed 
to 
the 
medical 
decision-making 
process.

RESULTS 


During 
the 
5-year 
period 
described, 
there 
were 
4,057 
adenotonsillectomy 
or 
tonsillectomy-alone 
procedures 
performed. 
The 
charts 
for 
305 
children 
aged 
3 
years 
or 
younger 
were 
reviewed. 
Of 
these, 
23 
children 
were 
excluded 
from 
the 
study 
for 
the 
following 
reasons: 
incomplete 
chart 
(n 
. 
8), 
procedure 
miscoded 
(n 
. 
2), 
additional 
procedures 
performed 
(n 
. 
5), 
or 
procedure 
performed 
during 
period 
of 
acute 
illness 
(n 
. 
8). 
The 
remaining 
282 
sets 
of 
patient 
data 
were 
included 
in 
the 
statistical 
analysis. 
The 
average 
age 
was 
30 
months. 
Table 1 summarizes the age distribution. UAO was 
identified 
as 
the 
primary 
indication 
for 
surgery 
in 
271 
of 
the 
patients. 


Sleep 
studies, 
including 
complete 
16-channel 
(n 
. 
38), 
4-channel 
(n 
. 
3), 
or 
hardcopy 
pulse-oximetry 
(n 
. 
2), 
were 
performed 
preoperatively 
in 
43 
patients. 
The 
average 
age 
of 
patients 
who 
had 
a 
preoperative 
PSG 
was 
25.9 
months, 
compared 
with 
31.1 
months 
in 
the 
non-PSG 
group 
(P 
. 
0.0001). 
Twenty-seven 
patients 
were 
identified 
as 
having 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
(OSA) 
with 
a 
respiratory 
disturbance 
index 
(RDI) 
that 
ranged 
from 
1 
to 
52. 
There 
was 
no 
statistical 
difference 
in 
the 
average 
LOS 
for 
patients 
with 
OSA 
when 
the 
subjects 
were 
grouped 
by 
using 
their 
RDI 
as 
a 
measure 
of 
OSA 
severity. 
The 
average 
LOS 
for 
patients 
with 
OSA 
was 
1.57 
days. 
The 
discharge 
criteria 
for 
patients 
typically 
requires 
that 
the 
patient 
not 
require 
any 
supplemental 
oxygen 
and 
be 
able 
to 
maintain 
oxygen 
saturations 
of 
90% 
without 
periods 
of 
sustained 
desaturation 
attributed 
to 
UAO. 
Upper 
airway 
resistance 
syndrome 
(UARS) 
was 
identified 
in 
11 
patients. 
UARS 
is 
abnormally 
increased 
upper 
airway 
resistance 
during 
sleep 
that 
leads 
to 
increased 
respiratory 
effort 
and 
sleep 
fragmentation 
without 
classically 
defined 
apneic 
or 
hypopneic 
episodes or notable declines in oxygen satura-
tion.10 The average LOS for patients with UARS 


(2.2 
days) 
was 
longer

LOS 
stay 
(1.57 
days) 
for 
patients 
with 
OSA 
(P 
. 
0.0448). 
The 
remaining 
sleep 
studies 
without 
a 
calculated 
RDI 
or 
UARS 
were 
classified 
as 
normal, 
mildly 
abnormal, 
or 
significantly 
abnormal 
by 
the 
pulmonologist 
reading 
the 
study. 


The 
average 
LOS 
for 
each 
age 
distribution 
was 
also 
calculated 
for 
each 
age 
group 
in 
both 
the 
non-PSG 
and 
PSG 
groups. 
The 
average 
LOS 
for 
all 
comparable 
age 
groups 
was 
less 
in 
the 
non-PSG 
group, 
with 
the 
shortest 
average 
LOS 
occurring 
in 
the 
37-to 
47-month 
age 
distribution 
in 
both 
the 
non-PSG 
and 
PSG 
groups. 
The 
average 
LOS 
for 
the 
non-PSG 
group 
was 
1.06 
days, 
compared 
with 
1.98 
days 
in 
the 
PSG 
group 
(P 
. 
0.0001). 
The 
age 
distribution 
and 
average 
LOS 
for 
both 
groups are listed in Table 2. 


Complications 
were 
identified 
in 
62 
patients 
(21.9%). 
For 
this 
study, 
a 
complication 
was 
defined 
as 
any 
documented 
desaturation 
event 
(regardless 
of 
SaO2 
nadir) 
or 
any 
other 
event 
or 
complication 
that 
required 
medical 
intervention 
or 
readmission 
or 
that 
prolonged 
the 
patient’s 
length 
of 
hospital 
stay. 
Comparisons 
were 
made 
between 
patients 
without 
PSG 
(n 
. 
239) 
and 
those 
with 
PSG 
results 
(n 
. 
43). 
Complications 
occurred 
in 
43 
patients 
(17.9%) 
in 
the 
non-PSG 
group 
and 
in 
19 
patients 
(44.2%) 
in 
the 
PSG 
group. 
The 
most 
common 
complication 
identified 
was 
oxygen 
desaturation 
in 
both 
groups, 
representing 
65.1% 
of 
the 
total 
complications 
in 
the 
non-PSG 
group 
and 
57.9% 
in 
the 
PSG 
group. 
Overall, 
desaturation 
events 
represented 
a 
13.8% 
complication 
rate 
(n 
. 
39) 
for 
the 
entire 
study 
population. 
Complications 
for 
each 
group 
are 
listed 
in 
Table 3. Additionally, Table 4 lists the total number of 
complications 
for 
the 
62 
patients 
identified 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
age 
distribution 
of 
the 
complication. 
The 
highest 
complication 
rate 
(32.8%) 
was 
found 
in 
the 
24-monthsand-
younger 
age 
group, 
with 
the 
lowest 
complication 
rate 
(8.1%) 
occurring 
in 
the 
37-to 
47-month 
age 
group. 
There 
was 
no 
statistical 
difference 
in 
the 
mean 
age 
of 
the 
patients 
who 
had 
complications 
in 
the 
PSG 
group 


(26.5 
months) 
compared 
with 
the 
case 
of 
the 
non-PSG 
group 
(27.2 
months), 
with 
a 
P 
value 
equal 
to 
0.7279. 
The 
average 
LOS 
for 
patients 
with 
complications 
in 
each group was also calculated and listed in Table 4. 
The 
average 
LOS 
for 
patients 
with 
complications 
in 
the 
non-PSG 
group 
was 
1.74 
days, 
compared 
with 


2.63 
days 
in 
the 
PSG 
group. 
A 
trend 
toward 
a 
longer 
average 
LOS 
in 
the 
PSG 
group 
was 
identified 
but 
the 
difference 
did 
not 
reach 
statistical 
significance 
(P 
. 
0.0997). 
Comorbidities 
and 
associated 
medical 
conditions 
were 
present 
in 
88 
patients. 
The 
most 
common 
conditions 
are listed in Table 5. Fifty-seven (23.8%) of the

DISCUSSION 


Sleep-disordered 
breathing 
is 
common 
in 
the 
pediatric 
population, 
with 
a 
reported 
prevalence 
between 
4% and 11%.11,12 UAO secondary to adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy 
is 
the 
primary 
cause 
of 
this 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
and 
has 
replaced 
recurrent 
tonsillitis 
as 
the 
most 
common 
indication 
for 
adenotonsillectomy 
in 
children.13 Adenotonsillectomy is considered the primary 
surgical 
treatment 
option 
for 
children 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
disorders, 
having 
been 
shown 
to 
improve 
sleep, 
breathing, 
PSG 
results, 
enuresis, 
and 
patient quality of life.14,15 


Several 
studies 
have 
compared 
the 
clinical 
diagnosis 
of OSA with formal PSG.16,17 These studies 
were 
completed 
before 
the 
recognition 
of 
UARS 
and 
before 
a 
clear 
consensus 
on 
a 
PSG 
definition 
of 
pediatric 
sleep 
apnea; 
therefore, 
the 
accuracy 
of 
making 
the 
clinical 
diagnosis 
of 
OSA 
remains 
in 
question 
when 
compared 
with 
PSG. 
In 
clinical 
practice, 
the 
decision 
to 
perform 
an 
adenotonsillectomy 
is 
often 
made 
without 
the 
benefit 
of 
a 
diagnostic 
sleep 
study, 
and 
the 
decision 
to 
perform 
surgery 
is 
based 
on 
clinical 
history 
and 
exam 
findings. 
This 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
findings 
of 
our 
study 
in 
which 


only 
15% 
of 
the 
patients 
(n 
. 
43) 
had 
a 
formal 
sleep 
study 
before 
their 
surgery. 
Sleep 
studies 
may 
also 
include 
nocturnal 
or 
hard 
copy 
to 
evaluate 
OSA. 
When 
used 
in 
children 
suspected 
of 
having 
OSAS, 
these studies have shown a high predictive value.22 
Sleep 
studies 
are 
typically 
ordered 
for 
patients 
with 
other 
comorbidities 
or 
for 
those 
patients 
considered 
to 
be 
at 
an 
increased 
risk 
for 
surgery 
when 
their 
clinical 
diagnosis 
is 
unclear. 
In 
this 
study, 
72% 
of 
the 
patients 
with 
sleep 
studies 
had 
other 
comorbidities 
or 
medical 
conditions, 
compared 
with 
24% 
of 
the 
patients 
without 
sleep 
studies. 


PSG 
has 
also 
been 
advocated 
as 
method 
to 
predict 
which 
children 
are 
at 
risk 
of 
postoperative 
respiratory 
complications 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
and 
to 
assist 
with 
postoperative 
planning 
and 
monitoring. 
Several 
studies 
have 
looked 
at 
the 
risk 
factors 
associated 
with 
postoperative complications.3-5,7 All of these studies 
identify 
age 
either 
younger 
than 
2 
years 
or 
younger 
than 
3 
years 
as 
a 
significant 
risk 
factor 
for 
postoperative 
respiratory 
compromise. 
Other 
risk 
factors 
identified 
include 
craniofacial 
anomalies, 
failure 
to 
thrive, 
hypotonia, 
morbid 
obesity, 
apnea 
or 
hypopnea 
index 
greater 
than 
5 
(or 
10), 
and 
preoperative 
oxygen 
saturation 
nadir. 
These 
studies 
were 
all 
performed 
retrospectively 
and 
used 
different 
inclusion 
and 
exclusion 
criteria 
for 
patients 
and 
various 
definitions 
and 
classifications 
for 
their 
complications. 


The 
complication 
rate 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
in 
children 
reported 
in 
several 
series 
ranges 
from 
0 
to 
32%, with airway issues or compromise representing 
0 to 16% of these complications.6,18-20 Those studies 
that 
were 
limited 
to 
younger 
children 
(3 
years 
of 
age 
and 
younger) 
showed 
a 
rate 
of 
airway 
complications 
ranging from 0 to 5%.6,18,19 Our study compares similarly, 
with 
an 
overall 
complication 
rate 
of 
22%, 
but 
our 
rate 
of 
airway 
complications, 
based 
on 
our 
classification, 
was 
higher 
with 
a 
rate 
of 
14% 
(n 
. 
39). 
It 
is 
difficult 
to 
compare 
the 
complication 
rates 
among 
studies 
because 
of 
the 
definitions 
used. 
For 
this 
study, 
a 
complication 
was 
defined 
as 
any 
documented 
desaturation 
event 
(regardless 
of 
SaO2 
nadir) 
or 
any 
other 
event 
or 
complication 
that 
required 
medical 
intervention

Some 
studies 
have 
identified 
minor 
and 
major 
complications depending upon the intervention required,
7 whereas other studies have attempted to identify 
complications 
based 
on 
the 
degree 
of 
airway 
obstruction 
or oxygen saturation nadir.4,5 This makes it 
difficult 
to 
compare 
complication 
rates 
among 
these 
studies 
to 
the 
results 
found 
in 
this 
study. 
Furthermore, 
the 
significance 
of 
postoperative 
desaturations 
is 
controversial. 
Theoretically, 
a 
decrease 
in 
oxygen 
saturation 
may 
increase 
the 
postoperative 
patient 
risk; 
however, 
no 
formal 
studies 
support 
this 
conclusion. 


In 
this 
study, 
we 
evaluated 
the 
severity 
of 
sleep-
disordered 
breathing 
or 
UAO 
identified 
on 
preoperative 
PSG 
to 
determine 
how 
well 
this 
correlated 
with 
a 
patient’s 
postoperative 
course; 
this 
was 
done 
by 
using 
average 
LOS 
as 
an 
indicator. 
There 
was 
no 
statistical 
difference 
in 
the 
average 
LOS 
for 
patients 
who 
were 
identified 
to 
have 
OSA 
when 
the 
severity 
of 
their 
OSA 
was 
compared 
by 
using 
their 
RDI. 
However, 
when 
comparing 
the 
patients 
with 
OSA 
to 
those 
with 
UARS, 
there 
was 
a 
statistically 
significant 
difference 
in 
the 
average 
LOS 
for 
these 
patients. 
The 
average 
LOS 
for 
OSA 
patients 
was 
1.5 
days, 
compared 
with 
2.2 
days 
in 
the 
UARS 
patients 
(P 
. 
0.0424). 
UARS 
has 
generally 
been 
considered 
to 
be 
a 
more 
mild 
form 
of 
sleep-
disordered 
breathing 
as 
compared 
with 
OSA; 
therefore, 
it 
is 
difficult 
to 
explain 
these 
findings. 
Additionally, 
the 


patients 
who 
underwent 
preoperative 
PSG 
had 
a 
longer 
average 
LOS 
(1.98 
days) 
compared 
with 
the 
patients 
in 
the 
non-PSG 
group 
(1.06 
days). 
This 
was 
statistically 
significant 
(P 
. 
0.0001). 
This 
indicates 
that 
patients 
who 
undergo 
preoperative 
sleep 
studies 
are 
likely 
at 
an 
increased 
risk 
postoperatively 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
factors 
such 
as 
their 
underlying 
medical 
condition 
or 
comorbidities. 
This 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
findings 
of 
this 
study 
in 
that 
the 
PSG 
group 
had 
a 
higher 
percentage 
of 
comorbidities 
(72%) 
when 
compared 
with 
the 
non-PSG 
group 
(24%). 


We 
recognize 
the 
limitations 
of 
a 
retrospective 
review 
in 
that 
it 
is 
not 
always 
possible 
to 
determine 
the 
rationale 
for 
all 
of 
the 
postoperative 
decisions 
that 
were 
made 
for 
each 
subject. 
This 
also 
made 
it 
difficult 
to 
accurately 
classify 
complications, 
because 
the 
oxygen 
saturation 
nadir 
and 
duration 
for 
desaturation 
events 
was 
not 
always 
recorded 
and 
may 
only 
be 
represented 
by 
a 
comment 
in 
the 
medical 
chart, 
such 
as 
“desats 
noted”. 
Second, 
the 
surgical 
technique 
and 
adjuvant 
therapies, 
such 
as 
steroids, 
anesthetic 
methods, 
and 
postoperative 
analgesia 
were 
not 
controlled 
for 
and 
are 
not 
addressed 
by 
this 
study. 
Additionally, 
we 
did 
not 
review 
the 
complication 
rate 
at 
this 
institution 
for 
all 
age 
groups 
other 
than 
those 
3 
years 
of 
age 
and 
younger; 
instead, 
we 
used 
the 
reported 
complication 
rates 
from 
other 
studies 
for 
comparison 
regarding 
older 
age 
groups. 


CONCLUSION 


This 
study 
suggests 
that 
although 
the 
complication 
rate 
may 
be 
higher 
in 
this 
younger 
population, 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
complications 
does 
not 
appear 
to 
have 
a 
large 
impact 
on 
their 
LOS. 
This 
study 
also 
suggests 
that 
the 
3-years-and-younger 
group, 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
other 
comorbidities, 
can 
safely 
undergo 
adenotonsillectomy 
without 
undergoing 
preoperative 
PSG, 
provided 
that 
close 
attention 
is 
paid 
to 
postoperative 
clinical 
findings 
while 
patients 
are 
being 
monitored. 
Furthermore, 
the 
cost, 
time, 
and 
expertise 
necessary 
for 
interpretation 
of 
the 
data 
have 
all 
affected 
the 
relative 
utility 
of 
PSG, 
especially 
in 
the 
pediatric 
population. 
The 
average 
cost 
of 
overnight 
PSG 
at 
a 
qualified 
institution 
is 
between

Volume

$600 and $2,800.21 Although home studies are valuable 
in 
the 
evaluation 
of 
adults, 
young 
children 
most 
often 
require 
overnight 
stays 
at 
centers 
where 
the 
study 
is 
being 
performed. 
Given 
this 
information, 
it 
would 
be 
impractical 
and 
not 
clinically 
justified 
to 
consider 
performing 
PSG 
on 
all 
pediatric 
patients 
before 
adenotonsillectomy. 
Higher 
risk 
as 
indicated 
by 
the 
increased 
LOS 
for 
certain 
patient 
groups 
with 
comorbidities 
does 
appear 
to 
exist, 
and 
we 
would 
reserve 
the 
use 
of 
preoperative 
PSG 
for 
these 
patients 
and 
for 
patients 
with 
ambiguous 
clinical 
history. 
The 
data 
in 
this 
study 
are 
inconclusive 
with 
regard 
to 
which 
medical 
conditions 
or 
comorbidities, 
and 
which 
immediate 
postoperative 
findings, 
would 
mandate 
an 
overnight 
inpatient 
stay. 
We 
believe 
that 
this 
question 
can 
only 
be 
answered 
with 
a 
prospective 
study 
that 
controls 
for 
the 
previously 
mentioned 
surgical 
variables 
and 
clearly 
defines 
the 
timing, 
degree, 
and 
duration 
of 
respiratory 
complications 
and 
their 
interventions. 


Preoperative 
PSG 
findings 
had 
little 
influence 
on 
the 
postoperative 
management 
of 
patients 
in 
this 
study. 
Postoperative 
management 
decisions 
are 
primarily 
based 
on 
the 
postoperative 
clinical 
findings 
present 
for 
each 
patient. 
Patients 
are 
managed 
individually 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
their 
postoperative 
course 
or 
established 
protocol, 
regardless 
of 
the 
PSG 
recommendations 
or 
predictions.
