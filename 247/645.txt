Objective: 
To 
determine, 
in 
a 
series 
of 
children 
younger 
than 
6 
years 
undergoing 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
treatment 
of 
clinical 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
syndrome 
(OSAS), 
the 
effect 
of 
age 
on 
prevalence 
of 
postoperative 
respiratory 
complications. 
The 
primary 
objective 
was 
to 
define 
a 
practice 
standard 
for 
postoperative 
hospital 
admission. 


Design: 
Retrospective 
analysis. 


Setting: 
Cincinnati 
Children’s 
Hospital 
Medical 
Center, 
Cincinnati, 
Ohio. 


Patients: 
All 
children 
younger 
than 
6 
years 
who 
underwent 
adenotonsillectomy 
to 
treat 
OSAS 
from 
June 
1, 
1999, 
to 
May 
31, 
2001. 


Main 
Outcome 
Measures: 
The 
percentage 
of 
children 
younger 
than 
3 
years 
undergoing 
adenotonsillectomy 
to 
treat 
OSAS 
who 
experience 
a 
postoperative 
respiratory 
complication. 


Results: 
Of 
2315 
patients 
younger 
than 
6 
years 
undergoing 
an 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
treatment 
of 
OSAS, 
149 
(6.4%) 
developed 
a 
postoperative 
respiratory 
complication. 
Even 
though 
there 
was 
a 
lower 
incidence 
of 
comorbid 
medical 
conditions 
in 
this 
cohort, 
children 
younger 
than 
3 
years 
were 
at 
a 
greater 
risk 
for 
developing 
a 
postoperative 
respiratory 
complication 
compared 
with 
those 
aged 
3 
to 
5 
years 
(9.8% 
vs 
4.9%, 
P.001). 
Logistic 
regression 
analysis 
revealed 
that 
children 
younger 
than 
3 
years 
had 
a 
nearly 
2-fold 
increased 
risk 
for 
respiratory 
complications 
postoperatively 
(odds 
ratio, 
1.98; 
95% 
confidence 
interval, 
1.412.77) 
when 
controlling 
for 
race 
and 
sex. 


Conclusions: 
Adenotonsillectomy 
to 
treat 
OSAS 
is 
associated 
with 
a 
significantly 
higher 
rate 
of 
postoperative 
respiratory 
complication 
in 
children 
younger 
than 
3 
years 
compared 
with 
children 
aged 
3 
to 
5 
years. 
Our 
results 
support 
hospital 
admission 
for 
all 
patients 
younger 
than 
3 
years 
undergoing 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
treatment 
of 
OSAS.

BSTRUCTIVE 
SLEEP 
APNEA 
syndrome 
(OSAS) 
in 
children 
is 
characterized 
by 
recurrent 
events 
of 
partial 
or 
complete 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
during 
sleep, 
resulting 
in 
disruption 
of 
normal 
ventilation 
and 
sleep 
patterns.1,2 
If 
untreated, 
childhood 
OSAS 
may 
lead 
to 
significant 
morbidity3-7 
and, 
in 
rare 
cases, 
mortality. 
These 
sequelae 
are 
the 
result 
of 
chronic 
nocturnal 
hypoxemia, 
acidosis, 
and 
sleep 
fragmentation. 
Obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
syndrome 
has 
become 
an 
important 
indication 
for 
adenotonsillectomy, 
which 
has 
become 
the 
first-line 
treatment 
for 
OSAS 
in 
children.2 
Several 
studies8,9 
have 
shown 
that 
adenotonsillectomy 
reverses 
the 
symptoms 
associated 
with 
childhood 
OSAS. 
Because 
physicians 
have 
increasing 
awareness 
of 
neurocognitive 
deficits 
associated 
with 
OSAS 
treated 
later 
in 
childhood,10 
more 
children 
are 
now 
undergoing 
adenotonsillectomy 
at 
a 
younger 
age. 


Because 
of 
advances 
in 
anesthetic 
and 
surgical 
techniques, 
third-party 
payers 
often 
encourage 
physicians 
to 
perform 
pediatric 
adenotonsillectomies 
on 
an 
outpatient 
basis. 
Altering 
practice 
patterns 
to 
include 
children 
at 
high 
risk 
for 
postoperative 
morbidity 
as 
candidates 
for 
outpatient 
adenotonsillectomy 
requires 
careful 
examination. 
With 
the 
use 
of 
dexamethasone 
phosphate 
and 
ondansetron 
hydrochloride, 
perioperative 
care 
of 
patients 
undergoing 
adenotonsillectomy 
has 
improved 
by 
reducing 
postoperative 
discomfort, 
improving 
dietary 
tolerance, 
and 
reducing 
postoperative 
emesis.11 
By 
reducing 
these 
postoperative 
complications, 
respiratory 
morbidity 
now 
accounts 
for 
most 
hospitalizations 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSAS 
and 
is 
a 
major 
factor 
in 
determining 
whether 
to 
perform 
inpatient 
vs 
outpatient 
surgery. 
The 
goal 
of 
this 
study 
is 
to 
determine, 
in 
a 
population 
of 
children 
undergoing 
adenotonsillectomy 
to 
treat 
clinical 
OSAS, 
the 
effect 
of 
age 
on 
prevalence 
of

Cincinnati 
Children’s 
Hospital 
Medical 
Center 
(CCHMC) 
serves 
as 
the 
community 
hospital 
for 
children 
in 
Cincinnati, 
Ohio, 
and 
as 
the 
tertiary 
care 
center 
for 
the 
greater 
Cincinnati 
area. 
Because 
more 
than 
2500 
adenotonsillectomies 
are 
performed 
annually 
at 
CCHMC, 
it 
is 
well 
suited 
to 
provide 
evidence 
that 
may 
guide 
practice 
patterns 
for 
care 
of 
children 
after 
adenotonsillectomy. 


METHODS
STUDY 
DESIGN 


All 
children 
who 
underwent 
an 
adenoidectomy, 
tonsillectomy, 
or 
both 
at 
CCHMC 
or 
its 
satellite 
facilities 
from 
June 
1, 
1999, 
to 
May 
31, 
2001, 
were 
identified 
from 
a 
medical 
records 
database. 
A 
search 
was 
performed 
using 
Current 
Procedural 
Terminology 
codes 
to 
determine 
the 
type 
of 
surgery 
and 
International 
Classification 
of 
Diseases, 
Ninth 
Revision 
(ICD-9)12 
diagnosis 
codes 
to 
determine 
the 
indication 
for 
surgery. 
In 
this 
manner, 
we 
identified 
children 
who 
had 
undergone 
an 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
obstructive 
breathing 
during 
sleep. 
A 
retrospective 
medical 
record 
review 
was 
undertaken 
to 
describe 
the 
children 
who 
met 
the 
inclusion 
criteria. 
The 
study 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
institutional 
review 
board 
at 
CCHMC. 


Exclusion 
criteria 
for 
study 
enrollment 
are 
as 
follows: 


v 
Recurrent 
adenotonsillitis 
as 
an 
indication 
for 
adenotonsillectomy. 


v 
No 
report 
of 
snoring 
on 
preoperative 
history 
and 
physical 
examination. 


v 
Concurrent 
surgical 
procedures 
that 
could 
lead 
to 
increase 
in 
the 
duration 
of 
general 
anesthesia. 


v 
Children 
with 
baseline 
low 
oxygen 
saturation 
or 
those 
requiring 
respiratory 
support 
preoperatively. 


The 
presence 
of 
obstructive 
breathing 
during 
sleep 
was 
determined 
by 
a 
history 
of 
snoring 
and 
the 
presence 
of 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy 
on 
physical 
examination 
by 
an 
otolaryngologist. 
The 
preoperative 
physician 
evaluation 
history, 
and 
physical 
examination 
were 
reviewed 
to 
determine 
the 
presence 
of 
comorbid 
conditions. 
Effects 
of 
comorbid 
conditions 
have 
been 
previously 
reported 
in 
children 
older 
than 
3 
years.13 
The 
patients 
were 
then 
stratified 
by 
age 
to 
establish 
the 
prevalence 
of 
postoperative 
respiratory 
complications 
in 
each 
age 
group. 
In 
this 
study, 
the 
exclusion 
criteria 
consisted 
of 
recurrent 
adenotonsillitis 
as 
an 
indication 
for 
adenotonsillectomy, 
no 
report 
of 
snoring 
on 
the 
preoperative 
physical 
examination 
and 
medical 
history 
obtained 
by 
the 
nursing 
staff, 
a 
lack 
of 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy 
on 
physical 
examination, 
any 
concurrent 
surgical 
procedures 
that 
could 
lead 
to 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
duration 
of 
general 
anesthesia, 
and 
a 
baseline 
preoperative 
awake 
hypoxia 
or 
the 
need 
for 
respiratory 
support 
before 
surgery. 


OPERATIVE 
PROCEDURE 


General 
anesthesia 
was 
induced, 
and 
most 
patients 
were 
given 
balanced 
gas 
anesthesia 
as 
well 
as 
intravenous 
nondepolarizing 
paralytics, 
short-acting 
narcotics, 
dexamethasone, 
and 
ondansetron 
at 
doses 
appropriate 
for 
patient 
weight. 
Unless 
patients 
were 
allergic 
to 
penicillin, 
patients 
received 
ampicillin 
intravenously, 
with 
the 
dose 
adjusted 
according 
to 
patient 
weight. 
Tonsillar 
tissue 
was 
removed 
using

The 
large 
number 
of 
adenotonsillectomies 
performed 
at 
our 
institution 
has 
resulted 
in 
a 
fairly 
standardized

technique 
that 
is 
followed 
closely 
by 
all 
attending 
physicians, 
fellow 
physicians, 
and 
resident 
house 
staff. 


STATISTICAL 
ANALYSIS 


We 
used 
SAS 
software 
(version 
8.2; 
SAS 
Inc, 
Cary, 
NC) 
for 
the 
statistical 
analyses. 
We 
performed 
descriptive 
analysis 
to 
calculate 
mean 
age 
and 
frequency 
counts 
of 
demographic 
variables 
and 
to 
identify 
children 
with 
postadenotonsillectomy 
respiratory 
complications 
stratified 
by 
age 
and 
those 
with 
comorbid 
medical 
conditions. 
We 
performed 
2 
analysis 
to 
compare 
patient 
age 
groups 
(3 
years 
and 
3-5 
years) 
for 
differences 
in 
percentages 
according 
to 
(1) 
sex 
and 
race 
and 
(2) 
postadenotonsillectomy 
respiratory 
complications. 
We 
calculated 
univariate 
logistic 
regression 
analysis 
to 
identify 
risk 
factors 
that 
independently 
predicted 
the 
presence 
of 
postoperative 
respiratory 
complications 
in 
children 
with 
OSAS. 
We 
then 
used 
multiple 
logistic 
regression 
analysis 
to 
calculate 
the 
odds 
ratios, 
which 
were 
adjusted 
for 
the 
effects 
of 
other 
risk 
factors 
in 
the 
model. 
In 
all 
regression 
analyses, 
the 
dependent 
variable 
was 
the 
occurrence 
of 
postoperative 
respiratory 
complications. 
The 
effect 
of 
age 
on 
the 
dependent 
variable 
was 
evaluated 
in 
separate 
models 
using 
age 
as 
a 
continuous 
variable 
or 
as 
a 
dichotomous 
variable 
(3 
years 
vs 
3-5 
years). 
A 
P 
value 
of 
less 
than 
.05 
was 
used 
to 
determine 
statistical 
significance. 


RESULTS
A 
total 
of 
3404 
patients 
younger 
than 
6 
years 
underwent 
tonsillectomy 
and/or 
adenoidectomy 
at 
CCHMC 
from 
May 
1999 
to 
June 
2001. 
Obstructive 
breathing 
during 
sleep 
was 
the 
indication 
for 
surgery 
in 
2315 
children 
(68%). 
The 
149 
children 
who 
developed 
postoperative 
respiratory 
complications 
requiring 
intervention 
constituted 
the 
study 
group, 
and 
no 
mortalities 
were 
noted 
among 
those 
children. 


Of 
all 
children 
with 
clinical 
OSAS, 
55.3% 
were 
boys, 
and 
44.7% 
were 
girls; 
83.4% 
were 
white, 
and 
14.1% 
were 
African 
American. 
We 
noted 
no 
significant 
differences 
in 
the 
percentage 
of 
patients 
in 
the 
group 
younger 
than 
3 
years 
and 
the 
group 
who 
were 
3 
to 
5 
years 
based 
on 
race 
or 
sex 
(Table). 
In 
analysis 
of 
all 
patients 
younger 
than 
6 
years 
who 
experienced 
respiratory 
complications, 
the 
most 
common 
complication 
was 
oxygen 
desaturation, 
which 
was

Of 
note, 
an

was 
required 
for 
treatment, 
with 
34.0% 
of 
patients 
receiving 
a 
nasopharyngeal 
airway 
and 
8.8% 
requiring 
endotracheal 
intubation. 
Among 
the 
27 
children 
with 
complications 
who 
had 
a 
chest 
radiograph, 
the 
findings 
for 
17 
(63%) 
revealed 
abnormalities 
that 
included 
atelectasis, 
infiltrate, 
and 
pulmonary 
edema. 
Other 
respiratory 
complications 
included 
the 
following: 


1. 
Oxygen 
desaturations 
below 
90%, 
requiring 
oxygen 
supplementation 
or 
diuretic 
therapy. 
2.

or 


pleural 
effusion. 


Among 
children 
younger 
than 
6 
years, 
58.3% 
had 
a 
history 
of 
comorbid 
medical 
conditions, 
and 
these 
conditions 
included 
asthma 
(29.5%), 
history 
of 
prematurity 
(15.4%), 
obesity 
(13.4%), 
central 
nervous 
system 
conditions 
(7.3%), 
craniofacial 
malformations 
(4.0%), 
and 
a 
history 
of 
previous 
airway 
surgery 
(4.0%). 
Obesity 
was 
defined 
as 
weight 
equal 
to 
or 
greater 
than 
the 
97th 
percentile 
for 
age 
and 
sex. 
It 
should 
be 
noted 
that 
fewer 
children 
in 
the 
group 
that 
was 
younger 
than 
3 
years 
had 
a 
comorbid 
medical 
condition 
than 
those 
in 
the 
3-to 
5-year-old 
group 
(51.4% 
vs 
64.9%). 


Children 
younger 
than 
3 
years 
with 
clinical 
OSAS 
were 
at 
a 
greater 
risk 
for 
experiencing 
postoperative 
respiratory 
complications 
compared 
with 
children 
who 
were 
aged 
3 
to 
5 
years 
(9.8% 
vs 
4.9%; 
P.001) 
(Figure). 
Likewise, 
comparing 
2-year-olds 
with 
3-year-olds 
yielded 
a 
significant 
increase 
in 
prevalence 
in 
respiratory 
complications 
(P.02). 


Logistic 
regression 
analysis 
demonstrated 
that 
children 
younger 
than 
3 
years 
have 
a 
nearly 
2-fold 
increased 
risk 
for 
respiratory 
complications 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
clinical 
OSAS 
(odds 
ratio, 
1.98; 
95% 
confidence 


interval, 
1.41-2.77) 
when 
controlling 
for

COMMENT
The 
number 
of 
adenotonsillectomies 
performed 
annually 
in 
the 
United 
States 
decreased 
from 
1.4 
million 
in 
1959 
to 
340 
000 
in 
1985. 
Chronic 
infection 
was 
the 
primary 
surgical 
indication 
for 
adenotonsillectomy 
in 
previous 
decades, 
whereas 
now 
airway 
obstruction 
and 
OSAS 
have 
become 
important 
preoperative 
indications 
for 
surgery.14 
In 
a 
recent 
review 
of 
the 
National 
Hospital 
Data 
Survey 
from 
1995 
to 
1999,15 
adenotonsillectomy 
remains 
the 
most 
common 
inpatient 
otolaryngologic 
surgical 
procedure 
for 
American 
children 
younger 
than 
15 
years. 
Several 
reports 
confirm 
the 
beneficial 
effects 
of 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSAS 
on 
children’s 
growth,3 
school 
performance,3 
and 
cardiac 
function.16 


Postoperative 
respiratory 
complications 
have 
been 
reported 
to 
occur 
in 
5% 
to 
25% 
of 
children 
with 
OSAS 
undergoing 
an 
adenotonsillectomy.13,17-21 
These 
complications 
include 
oxygen 
desaturation, 
atelectasis, 
pneumonia, 
pulmonary 
edema, 
pleural 
effusion, 
pneumothorax 
or 
pneumomediastinum, 
and 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
manifested 
as 
inspiratory 
stridor 
with 
increased 
work 
of 
breathing. 
The 
interventions 
employed 
to 
treat 
these 
conditions 
include 
oxygen 
supplementation, 
nasopharyngeal 
airway, 
administration 
of 
antibiotics 
to 
treat 
pneumonia, 
or 
diuretic 
therapy 
to 
treat 
pulmonary 
edema. 
The 
increased 
work 
of 
breathing 
may 
necessitate 
respiratory 
support 
ranging 
from 
continuous 
positive 
airway 
pressure 
to 
endotracheal 
intubation 
and 
mechanical 
ventilatory 
support. 


We 
present 
the 
largest 
young 
study 
population 
with 
clinical 
OSAS 
as 
the 
indication 
for 
adenotonsillectomy. 
In 
this 
series, 
the 
prevalence 
of 
postadenotonsillectomy 
respiratory 
complications 
in 
children 
with 
clinical 
OSAS, 
over 
a 
2-year 
period, 
was 
9.8% 
for 
children 
younger 
than 
3 
years 
and 
4.9% 
for 
children 
aged 
3 
to 
5 
years. 
Several 
factors 
could 
have 
contributed 
to 
the 
lower 
prevalence 
of 
posttonsillectomy 
respiratory 
complications 
in 
our 
study 
compared 
with 
prevalence 
rates 
reported 
in 
previous 
studies.18,22,23 
These 
factors 
include 
differences 
in 
referral 
patterns, 
study 
population, 
and 
diagnostic 
criteria 
for 
OSAS. 
Our 
results 
are 
in 
agreement 
with 
previous 
studies 
that 
report 
an 
increased 
risk 
for 
postoperative 
respiratory 
complications 
in 
children 
younger 
than 
3 
years.17-19,24-27 
It 
is 
important 
to 
mention 
that 
some 
of 
these 
previous 
studies 
were 
limited 
by 
small 
numbers 
of 
patients 
younger 
than 
3 
years17,18,23,25 
or 
included 
patients 
with 
OSAS 
and 
chronic 
adenotonsillitis 
as 
an 
indication 
for 
adenotonsillectomy 
in 
their 
case 


series.19,26-28 


Advances 
in 
anesthetic 
and 
surgical 
techniques 
have 
been 
reported 
to 
reduce 
postoperative 
morbidity

in 
children 
undergoing 
an 
adenotonsillectomy, 
and 
third-party 
payers 
often 
encourage 
adenotonsillectomy 
in 
these 
patients 
to 
be 
performed 
on 
an 
outpatient 
basis. 
Studies15,29-33 
have 
shown 
outpatient 
adenotonsillectomy 
to 
be 
a 
safe 
and 
cost-effective 
procedure 
for 
many 
pediatric 
patients, 
but 
some 
of 
these 
studies 
are 
limited 
owing 
to 
exclusion 
of 
patients 
with 
OSAS29 
or 
by 
small 
numbers 
of 
young 
pediatric 
patients.32,33 
The 
use 
of 
dexamethasone 
and 
ondansetron 
has 
improved 
the 
perioperative 
care 
of 
patients 
undergoing 
adenotonsillectomy. 
Dexamethasone 
has 
been 
shown 
to 
reduce 
postoperative 
discomfort, 
improve 
dietary 
tolerance, 
and 
almost 
eliminate 
postoperative 
emesis, 
presumably 
by 
reducing 
the 
inflammation 
in 
the 
oropharynx.
11 
With 
reduction 
of 
these 
postoperative 
complications, 
respiratory 
morbidity 
now 
accounts 
for 
a 
major 
number 
of 
hospitalizations 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSAS. 
Thus, 
the 
risk 
for 
postoperative 
respiratory 
complications 
is 
a 
major 
factor 
in 
determining 
whether 
to 
perform 
inpatient 
vs 
outpatient 
surgery. 
Despite 
using 
dexamethasone 
and 
ondansetron 
as 
a 
common 
procedure 
in 
all 
pediatric 
adenotonsillectomies 
at 
CCHMC, 
postoperative 
respiratory 
complications 
are 
persistently 
higher 
in 
very 
young 
children 
with 
OSAS. 


To 
best 
use 
health 
care 
dollars, 
it 
is 
thus 
essential 
to 
identify 
which 
children 
with 
OSAS 
are 
better 
suited 
to 
undergo 
inpatient 
adenotonsillectomy. 
The 
presence 
of 
comorbid 
conditions 
such 
as 
asthma, 
prematurity, 
and 
craniofacial 
malformations 
have 
been 
correlated 
with 
occurrence 
of 
postoperative 
respiratory 
complications,
2,13,17,18,23 
and 
as 
such, 
inpatient 
adenotonsillectomy 
is 
well 
accepted 
in 
these 
patients. 
Even 
for 
children 
without 
comorbid 
medical 
conditions, 
young 
age 
remains 
a 
widely 
accepted 
risk 
factor 
for 
postoperative 
respiratory 
complications.27 
In 
our 
study 
population 
of 
children 
with 
postoperative 
respiratory 
complications, 
51.4% 
of 
children 
younger 
than 
3 
years 
had 
a 
history 
of 
comorbid 
medical 
conditions, 
leaving 
nearly 
half 
of 
these 
children 
who 
experienced 
a 
postoperative 
respiratory 
complication 
with 
no 
medical 
history. 
Despite 
having 
no 
comorbid 
medical 
conditions, 
a 
large 
number 
of 
young 
children 
experienced 
postoperative 
respiratory 
complications, 
further 
highlighting 
young 
age 
as 
a 
criterion 
to 
consider 
when 
planning 
hospital 
admission. 
These 
findings 
are 
supported 
by 
Shapiro 
and 
Bhattacharyya,34 
who 
found 
outpatient 
adenotonsillectomy 
to 
be 
less 
cost-effective 
than 
hospital 
admission 
in 
children 
younger 
than 
3 
years 
(P.001). 


There 
are 
some 
limitations 
to 
this 
study. 
Parental 
history 
of 
snoring 
and 
a 
diagnosis 
of 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy 
were 
used 
as 
markers 
for 
obstructive 
breathing 
during 
sleep. 
This 
may 
have 
lead 
to 
the 
inclusion 
of 
some 
children 
with 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy 
who 
do 
not 
have 
objective 
OSAS, 
as 
could 
be 
proved 
with 
polysomnography. 
Also, 
the 
retrospective 
design 
prevents 
us 
from 
determining 
the 
association 
of 
severity 
of 
comorbid 
conditions 
with 
type 
and 
severity 
of 
postoperative 
respiratory 
complications. 


In 
conclusion, 
treating 
OSAS 
with 
adenotonsillectomy 
is 
associated 
with 
postoperative 
respiratory 
complications 
in 
about 
10% 
of 
children 
younger 
than 
3 
years 


in 
our 
study 
group. 
The 
prevalence 
of 
postoperative 
respiratory 
complications 
is 
significantly 
higher 
in 
children 
younger 
than 
3 
years 
compared 
with 
children 
aged 
3 
to 
5 
years. 
This 
study 
provides 
additional 
evidence 
for 
guidelines 
from 
the 
Academy 
of 
Otolaryngology 
Head 
and 
Neck 
Surgery 
promoting 
inpatient 
adenotonsillectomy 
in 
patients 
younger 
than 
3 
years.
