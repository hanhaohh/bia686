Abstract—Questions 
remain 
as 
to 
whether 
pediatric 
sleep 
disordered 
breathing 
increases 
the 
risk 
for 
elevated 
blood 
pressure 
and 
blood 
pressure–dependent 
cardiac 
remodeling. 
We 
tested 
the 
hypothesis 
that 
activity-adjusted 
morning 
blood 
pressure 
surge, 
blood 
pressure 
load, 
and 
diurnal 
and 
nocturnal 
blood 
pressure 
are 
significantly 
higher 
in 
children 
with 
sleep 
disordered 
breathing 
than 
in 
healthy 
controls 
and 
that 
these 
blood 
pressure 
parameters 
relate 
to 
left 
ventricular 
remodeling. 
24-hour 
ambulatory 
blood 
pressure 
parameters 
were 
compared 
between 
groups. 
The 
associations 
between 
blood 
pressure 
and 
left 
ventricular 
relative 
wall 
thickness 
and 
mass 
were 
measured. 
140 
children 
met 
the 
inclusion 
criteria. 
In 
children 
with 
apnea 
hypopnea 
index 
5 
per 
hour, 
a 
significant 
difference 
from 
controls 
was 
the 
morning 
blood 
surge. 
Significant 
increases 
in 
blood 
pressure 
surge, 
blood 
pressure 
load, 
and 
in 
24-hour 
ambulatory 
blood 
pressure 
were 
evident 
in 
those 
whom 
the 
apnea 
hypopnea 
index 
exceeded 
5 
per 
hour. 
Sleep 
disordered 
breathing 
and 
body 
mass 
index 
had 
similar 
effect 
on 
blood 
pressure 
parameters 
except 
for 
nocturnal 
diastolic 
blood 
pressure, 
where 
sleep 
disordered 
breathing 
had 
a 
significantly 
greater 
effect 
than 
body 
mass 
index. 
Diurnal 
and 
nocturnal 
systolic 
blood 
pressure, 
diastolic 
blood 
pressure, 
and 
mean 
arterial 
blood 
pressure 
predicted 
the 
changes 
in 
left 
ventricular 
relative 
wall 
thickness. 
Therefore, 
sleep 
disordered 
breathing 
in 
children 
who 
are 
otherwise 
healthy 
is 
independently 
associated 
with 
an 
increase 
in 
morning 
blood 
pressure 
surge, 
blood 
pressure 
load, 
and 
24-hour 
ambulatory 
blood 
pressure. 
The 
association 
between 
left 
ventricular 
remodeling 
and 
24-hour 
blood 
pressure 
highlights 
the 
role 
of 
sleep 
disordered 
breathing 
in 
increasing 
cardiovascular 
morbidity.

he 
association 
between 
sleep 
disordered 
breathing 
(SDB) 
and 
cardiovascular 
morbidity 
in 
adults 
has 
become 
an 
important 
consideration 
in 
the 
management 
of 
patients 
with 
SDB. 
Results 
from 
numerous 
cross-sectional 
and 
prospective 
studies 
of 
blood 
pressure 
(BP) 
control 
in 
adults 
support 
the 
concept 
that 
hypertension 
is 
an 
intermediate 
end 
point 
between 
SDB 
and 
cardiovascular 
disease.1,2 
Further 
support 
of 
this 
concept 
is 
derived 
from 
studies 
linking 
SDB 
to 
atherosclerotic 
pathways.3– 
6 
These 
studies 
provide 
insight 
into 
the 
mechanisms 
of 
vascular 
injury 
secondary 
to 
SDB. 
Although 
the 
impact 
of 
duration 
of 
this 
disorder 
on 
the 
development 
of 
risk 
factors 
for 
cardiovascular 
disease 
is 
difficult 
to 
estimate, 
morbidity 
secondary 
to 
SDB 
seems 
to 
manifest 
gradually, 
often 
taking 
decades. 
As 
such, 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
isolated 
cases 
of 
heart 
failure, 
children 
with 
SDB 
rarely 
show 
evidence 
of 
cardiovascular 
disease. 
Thus 
far, 
studies 
addressing 
whether 
children 
with 
SDB 
acquire 
risk 
factors 
for 
the 
early 
development 
of 
cardiovascular 
disease 
are 
inconclusive. 


Findings 
from 
several 
pediatric 
studies 
suggest 
that 
BP 
dysregulation 
is 
associated 
with 
the 
presence 
of 
SDB. 
We 


have 
previously 
demonstrated 
that 
in 
a 
group 
of 
children 
with 
SDB, 
the 
severity 
of 
the 
disorder 
was 
associated 
with 
increased 
BP 
variability 
and 
decreased 
nocturnal 
dipping.7 
Additionally, 
several 
cross-sectional 
studies 
have 
described 
trends 
of 
increasing 
BP 
with 
greater 
frequency 
of 
apnea 
and 
hypopneas 
index 
(AHI) 
during 
sleep.8–10 
To 
date, 
however, 
the 
level 
of 
SDB 
severity 
at 
which 
BP 
in 
pediatric 
SDB 
patients 
begins 
to 
diverge 
from 
that 
of 
healthy 
controls 
is 
not 
known. 
Furthermore, 
the 
relationship 
between 
24-hour 
ambulatory 
BP 
in 
children 
with 
SDB 
and 
changes 
in 
left 
ventricular 
geometry 
has 
not 
yet 
been 
evaluated. 


Twenty-four–hour 
ambulatory 
BP 
monitoring 
provides 
a 
window 
through 
which 
several 
measures 
of 
BP 
control 
can 
be 
examined. 
Among 
these 
measures 
are 
the 
rate 
of 
BP 
rise 
during 
the 
transition 
from 
sleep 
to 
wakefulness 
(referred 
to 
as 
morning 
BP 
surge), 
BP 
load, 
and 
diurnal 
and 
nocturnal 
BP 
measurements, 
all 
of 
which 
are 
important 
predictors 
of 
cardiovascular 
disease.11–15 
These 
parameters 
are 
known 
to 
be 
influenced 
by 
physical 
activity, 
degree 
of 
adiposity, 
and

demographic 
characteristics. 
A 
rigorous 
comparison 
of 
these 
parameters 
in 
children 
with 
SDB 
and 
healthy 
controls 
that 
adjusts 
for 
these 
confounding 
factors 
has 
not, 
however, 
been 
performed. 
We 
thus 
designed 
the 
current 
study 
to 
test 
the 
hypothesis 
that 
the 
morning 
BP 
surge, 
BP 
load, 
and 
diurnal 
and 
nocturnal 
BP 
are 
significantly 
higher 
in 
children 
with 
SDB 
than 
in 
healthy 
controls. 
We 
also 
endeavored 
to 
determine 
the 
level 
of 
SDB 
severity 
in 
children 
at 
which 
these 
specific 
BP 
measures 
significantly 
differ 
from 
healthy 
controls 
and 
how 
these 
measures 
relate 
to 
measures 
of 
left 
ventricular 
remodeling. 
The 
knowledge 
gained 
will 
provide 
an 
insight 
into 
the 
early 
cardiovascular 
changes 
associated 
with 
SDB 
in 
children 
and 
serve 
as 
a 
useful 
guideline 
for 
the 
management 
of 
children 
with 
the 
disorder. 


Methods 
Subjects 


Children 
ranging 
in 
age 
from 
7 
to 
13 
years 
with 
nightly 
snoring 
and 
hypertrophy 
of 
the 
tonsils 
and 
adenoids 
were 
recruited 
for 
this 
study. 
The 
inclusion 
criteria 
for 
the 
SDB 
group 
consisted 
of 
absence 
of 
chronic 
medical 
conditions 
and 
genetic 
syndromes, 
a 
polysomnogram 
consistent 
with 
the 
diagnosis 
of 
SDB 
which 
was 
defined 
as 
obstructive 
AHI 
greater 
than 
1 
per 
hour 
of 
sleep. 
Age-and 
gender-
matched 
healthy 
children 
comprised 
a 
control 
group. 
Additional 
inclusion 
criteria 
for 
the 
control 
group 
were: 
(1) 
absence 
of 
history 
of 
obstructive 
breathing 
during 
sleep; 
and 
(2) 
absence 
of 
SDB 
or 
alveolar 
hypoventilation 
on 
polysomnography. 
Children 
receiving 
chronic 
medications 
were 
excluded 
if 
they 
were 
unable 
to 
temporally 
discontinue 
their 
use. 
The 
duration 
of 
discontinuation 
of 
medications 
was 
recommended 
by 
the 
hospital 
pharmacists 
based 
on 
the 
pharmacokinetics 
of 
the 
drug. 
Children 
enrolled 
in 
this 
study 
were 
newly 
recruited 
and 
were 
not 
part 
of 
any 
of 
our 
prior 
studies. 


Polysomnography 


Polysomnography 
studies 
were 
performed 
overnight 
according 
to 
the 
American 
Thoracic 
Society 
standards16,17 
using 
computerized 
systems 
(Grass, 
Telefactor). 
The 
interpretation 
of 
polysomnography 
was 
performed 
by 
the 
investigator 
RA 
who 
was 
blinded 
as 
to 
which 
group 
subjects 
were 
enrolled 
in 
and 
to 
the 
results 
of 
24-hour 
ambulatory 
BP 
monitoring. 
The 
interpretations 
of 
BP 
and 
actigraphy 
were 
performed 
by 
a 
coordinator 
who 
was 
also 
blinded 
to 
the 
results 
of 
polysomnography. 


Twenty-Four-Hour 
Ambulatory 
BP 
Monitoring 


Noninvasive 
ambulatory 
BP 
was 
performed 
with 
an 
automatic 
BP 
monitor 
(SpaceLabs 
90207), 
which 
recorded 
BP 
and 
heart 
rate 
(HR) 
every 
15 
minutes 
during 
the 
awake 
period 
and 
during 
sleep. 
BP 
recording 
was 
obtained 
approximately 
2 
weeks 
after 
the 
polysomnography 
studies. 
For 
the 
purpose 
of 
calculating 
average 
BP 
during 
wakefulness 
and 
sleep, 
data 
were 
synchronized 
at 
the 
point 
of 
sleep 
onset, 
as 
determined 
by 
the 
actigraphy 
readings. 
The 
15-minute 
BP 
and 
HR 
readings 
were 
then 
averaged 
into 
1-hour 
epochs 
for 
each 
subject. 
Sleep 
data 
were 
defined 
as 
Time 
8 
hours, 
where 
the 
actigraphy 
continued 
to 
indicate 
sleep. 
Wake 
data 
were 
defined 
as 
Time 
10 
hours, 
where 
the 
actigraphy 
indicated 
wake. 
Data 
from 
the 
9th 
hour 
from 
sleep 
onset 
included 
varying 
periods 
of 
wakefulness 
and 
sleep 
and, 
therefore, 
were 
not 
used. 
For 
the 
purpose 
of 
calculating 
morning 
BP 
surge, 
data 
were 
synchronized 
at 
the 
point 
of 
wake 
onset, 
as 
determined 
by 
the 
actigraphy 
readings. 
The 
morning 
BP 
surge 
was 
defined 
as 
the 
slope 
of 
BP 
from 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
last 
hour 
of 
sleep 
to 
the 
end 
of 
the 
first 
hour 
of 
awakening. 
BP 
load 
was 
measured 
by 
calculating 
the 
percentage 
of 
systolic 
and 
diastolic 
measurements 
above 
the 
95th 
percentile 
according 
to 
published 
age 
and 
gender-appropriate 
values.18 


Assessment 
of 
Physical 
Activity 
by 
Actigraphy 


Subjects 
wore 
an 
actigraph 
(Ambulatory 
Monitoring 
Inc) 
on 
their 
wrist 
during 
wakefulness 
and 
sleep. 
Activity 
was 
recorded 
in 
10-second 
epochs 
throughout 
the 
24-hour 
period. 
A 
weighted 
activity 
per 
subject 
was 
calculated 
by 
weighting 
by 
5 
the 
actigraphy 
reading 
corresponding 
to 
the 
15-minute 
BP 
measurement, 
adding 
the 
previous 
5 
actigraphy 
readings, 
and 
then 
calculating 
the 
average. 
The 
square 
root 
transformation 
was 
applied 
to 
all 
activity 
measures 
to 
reduce 
the 
positive 
skew 
of 
the 
distribution 
and 
to 
improve 
normality.19 


Echocardiography 


Two-dimensional 
and 
two-dimensionally 
directed 
M-mode 
echocardiographic 
images 
were 
recorded 
to 
determine 
relative 
wall 
thickness 
and 
left 
ventricular 
mass 
as 
previously 
described.20 


Statistical 
Analysis 


All 
results 
are 
expressed 
as 
meanSD, 
except 
where 
noted 
as 
meanSEM. 
Log 
transformation 
of 
AHI 
was 
performed 
to 
achieve 
normal 
distribution. 
The 
body 
mass 
index 
(BMI) 
was 
converted 
into 
a 
Z 
score 
according 
to 
the 
standard 
published 
by 
the 
CDC.21 
For 
comparison 
of 
means, 
a 
1-way 
analysis 
of 
variance 
was 
performed 
for 
Age, 
BMI, 
and 
BMIZ; 
differences 
in 
other 
continuous 
variables 
were 
tested 
with 
the 
Kruskal-Wallis 
nonparametric 
test. 
Pearson 
chi-square 
tests 
were 
used 
to 
measure 
differences 
between 
groups 
for 
gender, 
race, 
and 
BP 
load 
variables. 
A 
significance 
level 
of 
0.05 
was 
used 
for 
all 
tests. 


Inferential 
Analysis 


Three-step 
analyses 
were 
performed 
to 
determine 
the 
independent 
effect 
of 
SDB 
on 
BP 
parameters. 
The 
first 
step 
aimed 
at 
determining 
whether 
a 
difference 
in 
BP 
and 
HR 
existed 
between 
the 
control 
and 
the 
SDB 
groups 
by 
performing 
a 
repeated 
measures 
analysis 
and 
modeling 
within 
subject 
variance/covariance 
over 
time. 
The 
following 
independent 
variables 
were 
used: 
group, 
time 
defined 
as 
the 
hourly 
BP 
measurements, 
age, 
BMI 
Z 
score, 
gender, 
activity, 
and 
race. 
SDB 
groups 
were 
compared 
with 
controls, 
using 
Dunnett 
adjustment. 
The 
second 
step 
consisted 
of 
subgrouping 
the 
study 
population 
into 
lean 
and 
obese 
children 
and 
performing 
a 
repeated 
measures 
analysis 
comparing 
the 
LS-means 
of 
4 
groups: 
lean-
control, 
lean-SDB, 
obese-control, 
and 
obese-SDB. 
Such 
approach 
was 
taken 
to 
further 
discern 
the 
influence 
of 
SDB 
from 
that 
of 
obesity 
in 
predicting 
BP. 
The 
third 
step 
aimed 
at 
determining 
the 
overall 
effect 
of 
polysomnographic 
parameters; 
namely 
AHI, 
lowest 
oxygen 
saturation, 
and 
arousal 
index 
on 
BP. 
A 
mixed 
model 
analysis 
was 
performed 
with 
polysomnographic 
parameters 
used 
as 
continuous 
variables. 
A 
null-model 
chi-square 
likelihood 
ratio 
test 
was 
used 
to 
determine 
goodness-of-fit 
(P0.0001) 
for 
all 
models. 


The 
relative 
predictive 
contributions 
of 
BMI 
and 
AHI 
were 
tested 
for 
a 
significant 
difference 
as 
follows: 
both 
were 
standardized 
to 
unit 
SD 
before 
entry 
into 
repeated 
measures 
models 
predicting 
BP. 
Their 
2 
coefficients 
from 
a 
model 
were 
then 
compared 
using 
a 
t 
test. 


The 
relationship 
between 
BP 
parameters 
and 
left 
ventricular 
relative 
wall 
thickness 
and 
mass 
was 
measured 
by 
partial 
Pearson 
correlation 
adjusted

analysis. 
The 
linear 
regression 
controlled 
for 
gender 
and 
ethnicity 
in 
addition 
to 
age 
and 
BMI 
Z 
score. 


Initial 
analyses 
focused 
on 
comparing 
healthy 
controls 
to 
all 
SDB 
subjects. 
We 
considered 
the 
possibility 
that 
a 
significant 
divergence 
of 
BP 
parameters 
in 
SDB 
subjects 
may 
not 
occur 
in 
mild 
cases, 
but 
does 
occur 
in 
children 
with 
higher 
levels 
of 
AHI. 
Based 
on 
descriptive 
statistics 
and 
the 
distribution 
of 
subjects 
available 
in 
our 
study, 
we 
hypothesized 
that 
children 
with 
AHI 
5 
may 
exhibit 
a 
significant 
difference 
in 
BP 
parameters 
from 
healthy 
controls. 
Whereas 
the 
primary 
analyses 
focused 
on 
comparing 
the 
control 
group 
to 
the 
severe 
group, 
we 
also 
compared 
the 
control 
group 
to 
the 
mild 
(AHI 
5) 
group. 


Informed 
consent 
was 
obtained 
from 
the 
parents/legal 
guardian 
of 
each 
child, 
and 
assent 
was 
obtained 
from 
children 
older 
than 
7

Fifty-three 
percent 
of 
subjects 
with 
SDB 
had 
an 
AHI 
between 


1.1 
and 
5 
per 
hour 
of 
sleep 
(mild 
SDB), 
whereas 
47% 
of 
subjects 
had 
an 
AHI 
5 
(severe 
SDB). 
In 
subjects 
with 
severe 
SDB, 
the 
obstructive 
AHI 
were 
more 
frequent 
and 
lasted 
longer 
than 
in 
those 
with 
mild 
SDB 
and 
also 
were 
associated 
with 
lower 
oxygen 
desaturation 
compared 
with 
those 
with 
mild 
SDB 
and 
healthy

(BMI274.8). 
Differences 
between 
least 
square 
means 
adjusted 
for 
age, 
gender, 
race, 
and 
activity 
were 
measured 
between 
lean

and 
lean 
children 
with 
SDB 
for 
wake 
systolic 
BP 
1080.7 
versus 
1110.7 
(P0.01), 
wake 
diastolic 
BP 
670.5

(p.

wake 
mean

810.5 
versus

(P0.0002), 
and 
wake 
HR 
910.9 
versus 
950.8 
(P0.003). 
Differences 
in 
the

parameters 
were 
measured 
for 
diastolic 
BP 
560.6 
versus 
580.6 
(P0.007) 


and 
mean 
arterial 
BP 
720.6 
versus 
740.6 
(P0.04). 
Because 
of 
the 
small 
number 
of 
obese 
controls, 
there 
was 
no 
difference 
measured 
in 
any 
of 
BP 
parameters 
between 
the 
2 
obese 
groups. 
In 
comparison 
to 
lean 
children 
with 
SDB, 
obese 
children 
with 
SDB 
had 
a 
higher 
wake 
systolic

1140.8 
versus 
1100.7 
(P0.001) 
and

1021 
versus 
980.9 
(P0.02) 
after 
adjusting 
for 
the 
severity 
of 
SDB. 
There 
were 
no 
significant 
differences 
in 
diastolic 
or 
mean 
arterial

between 
the 
two 
SDB 
groups. 


Mixed 
Model 
Analysis 


The 
mixed 
model 
analyses 
with 
Log 
AHI 
as 
a 
continuous 
variable 
showed 
that 
AHI 
was 
a 
significant 
predictor 
for 
systolic, 
diastolic, 
and 
mean 
arterial 
BP 
surge 
as 
well 
as 
diurnal 
and 
nocturnal 
systolic, 
diastolic 
and 
mean 
arterial 
BP 
(Tables 
3 
and 
4). 
The 
minimum 
oxygen 
saturation 
was 
a 
significant 
predictor 
of 
wake 
systolic 
BP 
(P0.03), 
diastolic 
BP 
(P0.03), 
and 
mean 
arterial 
BP 
(P0.005). 
During 
sleep 
the 
minimum 
oxygen 
saturation 
predicted 
systolic 
BP 
(P0.02), 
diastolic 
BP 
(P0.0005), 
and 
mean 
arterial 
BP 
(P0.002). 
The 
log 
arousal 
index 
was 
also 
a 
significant 
predictor 
of 
wake 
diastolic 
BP 
(P0.004), 
wake 
mean 
arterial 
BP 
(P0.04), 
sleep 
diastolic 
BP 
(P0.02), 
and 
mean 
arterial 
BP 
(P0.03). 
These 
results 
indicate 
a 
dose 
dependent 
increase 
in 
BP 
with 
increase 
severity 
of 
SDB 
in 
children.

Relative 
Contributions 
of 
Obesity 
and

to 
24-Hour 
Ambulatory 
BP 


The 
relative 
predictive 
contributions 
of 
AHI 
and 
BMI 
were 
significantly 
different 
for 
nocturnal 
diastolic 
BP 
with 
parameter 
estimates 
of 
0.16 
and 
0.01, 
respectively 
(0.150.08, 
P0.03). 
However, 
there 
was 
no 
significant 
difference 
in 
the 
predictive 
contributions 
of 
Log 
AHI 
and 
BMI 
Z 
score 
of 
diurnal 
systolic 
BP, 
diastolic 
BP, 
and 
sleep 
systolic 
BP. 
These 
results 
demonstrate 
that 
SDB 
severity 
and 
BMI 
have 
similar 
effect 
on 
BP 
parameters 
except 
for 
nocturnal 
diastolic 
BP 
where 
SDB 
has 
a 
significantly 
greater 
effect 
than 
BMI.

The

for

0.310.009,

in

included

Discussion 
Our 
results 
clearly 
indicate 
that 
after 
adjusting 
for 
physical 
activity 
and 
controlling 
for 
confounding 
factors, 
children 
with 
SDB 
exhibit 
a 
significantly 
higher 
24-hour 
BP 
and 
faster 
HR 
than 
age-and 
gender-matched 
healthy 
controls. 
The 
study 
adopted 
a 
rigorous 
and 
novel 
approach 
in 
discerning 
the 
effect 
of 
obesity 
from 
that 
of 
SDB 
on 
BP 
in 
children. 
The 
differences 
in 
BP 
parameters 
observed 
in 
the 
whole 
study 
population 
were 
clearly 
evident 
when 
the 
same 
analyses 
were 
applied 
to 
lean 
controls 
and 
lean 
children 
with 
SDB. 
Also, 
we 
have 
found 
that 
differences 
in 
BP 
parameters 
are 
associated 
with 
end 
organ 
changes, 
namely 
left 
ventricular 
remodeling. 
Additionally, 
for 
the 
first 
time, 
we 
have 
described 
the 
level 
of 
SDB 
associated 
with 
elevation 
of 
BP 
and 
have 
demonstrated 
that 
the 
AHI 
threshold 
associated 
with 
BP 
dysregulation 
falls 
within 
the 
range 
thought 
to 
represent 
the 
mildest 
level 
of 
SDB. 
These 
collective 
findings 
provide 
new 
insights 
into 
the 
early 
stages 
of 
BP 
dysregulation 
associated 
with 
SDB 
and 


provide 
evidence 
supporting 
a 
rationale 
for 
treating 
children 
with 
even 
a 
mild 
degree 
of 
SDB. 


The 
study 
examined 
3 
BP 
parameters: 
morning 
BP 
surge, 
BP 
load, 
and 
mean 
nocturnal 
and 
diurnal 
BP. 
We 
have 
showed 
that 
children 
with 
mild 
SDB 
exhibited 
an 
exaggerated 
morning 
systolic 
BP 
surge 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
significant 
elevation 
in 
nocturnal 
and 
diurnal 
BP. 
However, 
those 
with 
an 
AHI 
greater 
than 
5 
exhibited 
both 
a 
significantly 
greater 
morning 
BP 
surge 
and 
elevation 
of 
nocturnal 
and 
diurnal 
BP 
as 
compared 
with 
healthy 
controls. 
Several 
investigators 
have 
proposed 
that 
an 
exaggerated 
morning 
BP 
surge 
may 
advance 
vascular 
remodeling 
from 
the 
larger 
arteries 
to 
the 
small 
resistance 
vessel 
because 
of 
the 
shear 
stress 
of 
an 
exaggerated 
fluctuations 
of 
blood 
flow 
on 
the 
vessel 
wall.22–24 
Indeed, 
various 
cardiovascular 
morbidities 
have 
been 
described 
in 
patients 
with 
an 
exaggerated 
morning 
BP 
surge. 
These 
studies, 
conducted 
primarily 
in 
adults, 
consistently 
indicate 
that 
morning 
BP 
surge 
is 
an 
important 
predictor 
of 
the 
development 
of 
risk 
markers 
such 
as 
increased 
carotid 
intima 
thickness14 
myocardial 
hypertrophy 
and 
infarction25 
and 
cardiovascular 
events, 
such 
as 
stroke.26,12 
Morning 
BP 
surge 
is 
a 
normal 
phenomenon 
attributed 
to 
enhanced 


-adrenergic 
vasoconstrictor 
response,27 
increased 
activity 
of 
the 
rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone 
system, 
and 
reduced 
early 
morning 
endothelial 
function. 
The 
mechanisms 
of 
exaggerated 
morning 
BP 
surge 
in 
children 
with 
SDB 
have 
not 
yet 
been 
studied. 
As 
with 
the 
morning 
BP 
surge, 
increased 
BP 
load 
is 
also 
known 
to 
trigger 
myocardial 
and 
vascular 
remodeling. 
Mitsnefes 
and 
colleagues 
have 
reported 
that 
in 
children 
who 
have 
undergone 
renal 
transplants, 
systolic 
BP 
load 
was 
associated 
with 
decreased 
carotid 
artery 
distensibility.14 


The 
clinical 
significance 
of 
the 
differences 
in 
BP 
parameters 
between 
children 
with 
SDB 
and 
healthy 
controls 
is 
highlighted 
by 
the 
observed 
independent 
association 
between 
BP 
and 
left 
ventricular 
remodeling. 
We 
have 
previously 
demonstrated 
a 
greater 
relative 
wall 
thickness 
and 
left 
ventricular 
mass 
index 
in 
children 
with 
SDB 
as 
compared 
with 
children 
with 
simple 
snoring.20 
However, 
casual 
BP 
measurements 
were 
not 
significantly 
different 
between 
groups. 
This 
study 
adds 
to 
the 
previous 
knowledge 
showing 
that 
changes 
in 
ambulatory 
BP, 
although 
small 
in 
magnitude, 
correlate 
with 
measures 
of 
end 
organ 
damage. 


Understanding 
the 
causal 
relationship 
between 
BP 
dysregulation 
and 
SDB 
in 
children 
requires 
reevaluation 
of 
BP 
after 
resolution 
of 
SDB. 
To 
accurately 
predict 
the 
reversibility 
of 
BP 
dysregulation 
after 
treatment, 
it 
is 
essential 
to 
determine 
which 
BP 
parameter(s) 
is/are 
differentially 
affected 
by 
obesity 
versus 
SDB. 
We 
have 
shown 
that 
there 
was 
no 
significant 
difference 
between 
the 
effects 
of 
BMI 
and 
AHI 
on 
wake 
systolic 
and 
diastolic 
BP 
and 
sleep 
systolic 
BP. 
However, 
a 
greater 
contribution 
by 
SDB 
to 
changes 
in 
nocturnal 
diastolic 
BP 
was 
observed. 
Thus, 
in 
future 
studies 
that 
examine 
the 
effect 
of 
treatment 
on 
BP 
regulation 
in 
children 
with 
SDB, 
we 
anticipate 
observing 
a 
greater 
change 
in 
nocturnal 
diastolic 
BP 
than 
in 
BP 
measurements 
that 
seem 
to 
be 
equally 
influenced 
by 
obesity 
and 
SDB.

Additionally, 
children 
with 
SDB 
exhibit 
a 
faster 
HR 
during 
wakefulness 
and 
during 
sleep 
even 
after 
controlling 
for 
confounding 
variables. 
Diurnal 
and 
nocturnal 
BP 
and 
HR 
are 
thus 
independently 
associated 
with 
measures 
of 
severity 
of 
SDB. 
A 
normal 
physiological 
response 
to 
increasing 
BP 
is 
a 
slowing 
of 
HR 
through 
a 
baroreceptor 
loop. 
The 
presence 
of 
a 
significant 
elevation 
of 
BP 
simultaneously 
with 
an 
increase 
in 
HR 
may 
be 
an 
indicator 
of 
baroreflex 
dysfunction 
in 
children 
with 
SDB. 
Exaggerated 
sympathetic 
tone 
or 
elevation 
in 
blood 
volume 
might 
be 
possible 
pathways 
overriding 
tight 
baroreceptor 
control. 


An 
important 
limitation 
to 
the 
study 
is 
the 
cutoff 
we 
have 
used 
to 
define 
the 
95th 
percentile 
for 
systolic 
and 
diastolic 
BP. 
The 
study 
referenced 
the 
data 
to 
distributions 
of 
casual 
BP 
published 
in 
the 
Report 
of 
the 
Second 
Task 
Force 
on 
Blood 
Pressure 
Control 
in 
Children.18 
Applying 
casual 
BP 
cutoffs 
to 
ambulatory 
BP 
measurements 
to 
set 
threshold 
limits 
for 
defining 
BP 
pressure 
load 
and 
hypertension 
does, 
however, 
introduce 
an 
important 
error. 
This 
error 
is 
derived 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
ambulatory 
BP 
normative 
data 
tend 
to 
provide 
higher 
BP 
limits 
for 
age 
and 
gender 
compared 
with 
casual 
BP. 
We 
have 
elected 
to 
use 
casual 
BP 
cutoffs 
because 
the 
age 
and 
height 
of 
our 
study 
population 
fell 
outside 
the 
ranges 
previously 
published 
in 
ambulatory 
BP 
literature. 
In 
an 
effort 
to 
minimize 
the 
error 
derived 
from 
the 
discrepancy 
between 
the 
2 
methods, 
we 
applied 
the 
same 
cutoff 
to 
children 
with 
SDB 
and 
healthy 
controls. 
We 
also 
avoided 
categorizing 
subjects 
as 
hypertensive 
based 
on 
a 
casual 
BP 
cutoff. 


Despite 
these 
limitations, 
our 
study 
clearly 
demonstrates 
a 
significant 
trend 
of 
an 
increasing 
number 
of 
measurements 
exceeding 
the 
cutoff 
for 
casual 
BP 
with 
increasing 
severity 
of 
SDB. 


The 
findings 
from 
this 
study 
broaden 
our 
knowledge 
of 
BP 
control 
in 
children 
with 
SDB 
by 
demonstrating 
that 
in 
the 
prehypertensive 
stage, 
a 
cluster 
of 
ambulatory 
BP 
parameters 
reflect 
a 
dysregulation 
of 
BP 
control. 
These 
parameters 
include 
increases 
in 
both 
BP 
surge 
and 
BP 
load, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
previously 
described 
changes 
in 
BP 
variability 
and 
nocturnal 
BP 
dipping.7 


Perspectives 


This 
study 
describes 
the 
complex 
interaction 
between 
physical 
activity, 
adiposity, 
and 
SDB 
in 
modifying 
diurnal 
and 
nocturnal 
BP 
parameters 
in 
otherwise 
healthy 
children. 
The 
detection 
of 
a 
significant 
difference 
in 
systolic 
BP 
surge 
at 
a 
mild 
level 
of 
SDB 
suggests 
that 
exaggerated 
rise 
in 
morning 
BP 
might 
be 
one 
of 
the 
earliest 
changes 
in 
BP 
control 
in 
children 
with 
SDB. 
The 
linear 
relationship 
between 
24-hour 
BP 
and 
left 
ventricular 
wall 
thickness 
provides 
a 
mechanism 
for 
cardiac 
remodeling 
in 
children 
with 
SDB. 
The 
findings 
also 
suggest 
that 
children 
with 
SDB 
who 
are 
left 
untreated 
may 
be 
at 
increasing 
risk 
for 
left 
ventricular 
hypertrophy, 
itself 
an 
independent 
risk 
factor 
for 
cardiovascular 
disease. 
With 
the 
widespread 
availability 
of 
24-hour 
ambulatory, 
and 
because 
of 
the 
relationship 
found 
in 
our 
study 
between 
parameters 
of 
BP 
with 
end-organ 
damage, 
such 
test 
could 
guide 
the 
management 
of 
children 
with 
SDB.
