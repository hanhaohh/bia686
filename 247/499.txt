ABSTRACT. Objective. The pathophysiological mechanisms 
of growth impairment frequently associated with 
the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in children 
are poorly defined. The main objective of this study 
was to evaluate whether nighttime upper airway obstruction 
attributable to adenotonsillar hypertrophy and subsequent 
surgical treatment affect the circulating concentrations 
of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and IGF-
binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) along with other growth 
parameters in children. 

Patients and Methods. We initially studied 70 children 
(mean age: 5.8 years; range: 2.4–10.5 years) admitted 
to a university hospital because of clinical symptoms of 
OSAS. Their sleep was monitored with a 6-channel computerized 
polygraph. Data on anthropometry and circulating 
concentrations of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 were generated 
and compared with corresponding characteristics in 
control children (N . 
35). Thirty children with an obstructive 
apnea-hypopnea index (OAHI) of 1 or more 
were categorized as children with OSAS (mean OAHI: 

5.4 [95% confidence interval for mean (CI): 3.8 –6.9]), 
whereas 40 children with an OAHI of <1 were considered 
as primary snorers (PS) (mean OAHI 0.13 [95% CI: 
0.05–0.21]). Nineteen children with OAHI >2 underwent 
adenotonsillectomy attributable to OSAS and were reassessed 
6 months later together with 34 nonoperated children 
with OAHI <2. 
Results. There were no initial differences in relative 
height and weight for height between the 3 groups of 
children. No differences were observed in peripheral 
IGF-I concentrations, but both OSAS and PS children 
had reduced peripheral IGFBP-3 levels. The operated 
children with initial OSAS experienced a highly significant 
reduction in their OAHI from 7.1 (95% CI: 5.1–9.1) 
to 0.37 (95% CI: 0.2–0.95). Weight-for-height, body mass 
index, body fat mass, and fat-free mass increased during 
the follow-up in the operated children with OSAS, 
whereas only fat-free mass and relative height increased 
in the PS children. Both the IGF-I and the IGFBP-3 concentrations 
increased significantly in the operated children, 
whereas no significant changes were seen in the PS 
children. 

Conclusions. These observations indicate that growth 
hormone secretion is impaired in children with OSAS 
and PS. Respiratory improvement after adenotonsillec-

noring is relatively common in children, with 
the prevalence of regular snoring about 10% in 
preschool-aged subjects.1–3 Obstructive sleep 
apnea syndrome (OSAS), a condition related to snoring, 
is estimated to affect 0.7% to 3.4% of all children 
according to epidemiologic surveys.1,2,4 Pediatric 
OSAS may occasionally lead to even life-threatening 
complications,5 but less serious complications, such 
as failure to thrive, are more commonly recognized. 
Retarded weight and height gain as complications of 
pediatric OSAS and “catch-up” growth after treatment 
have been well-documented.6–11 The prevalence 
of this phenomenon is unknown. The cause of 
poor growth is not known, although many different 
reasons have been implicated. Abnormal nocturnal 
growth hormone (GH) secretion has been suggested 
as one possible cause.5,9,12 

Circulating concentrations of insulin-like growth 
factor-I (IGF-I) and IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) 
are strongly related to diurnal GH secretion, reflecting 
mean daily GH levels, and seem to correlate well 
with physiologic changes in GH secretion.13,14 IGF-1 
is perceived as the main mediator of the growth-
promoting actions of GH,15 but its association with 
growth in children with OSAS has been poorly explored. 


The purpose of this study was to examine the 
growth of children with symptoms of obstructive 
sleep disorder, verified as OSAS or primary snoring 
on overnight sleep monitoring. The main objective 
was to analyze the relationship between obstructive 
sleep disturbance and biochemical growth factors, as 
well as the effect of surgical treatment (adenotonsillectomy) 
on growth and growth factors.

PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS 

Participants 

The study population comprised children referred from primary 
health care to the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Oulu 
University Hospital, during the period 1994 –1997 for an assessment 
of their need for treatment because of nighttime snoring, 
apneas, or difficult breathing, presumably secondary to adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy. Children with known upper airway anomalies, 
any underlying disease predisposing to upper airway obstruction, 
asthma, or perennial allergy were excluded. The parents completed 
a detailed questionnaire regarding their child’s day and 
nighttime symptoms. After a review of the questionnaires, the 
children with symptoms for 6 months were invited for an ear, 
nose, and throat evaluation and a thorough update of patient 
history. If upper airway anomalies or abnormal facial morphology 
were recognized, the children were excluded. Previous adenoidectomy 
did not lead to exclusion. Seventy-eight children fulfilled 
the inclusion criteria. They had all symptoms suggestive of OSAS, 
were regular snorers and/or were observed to have apneas during 
sleep, and were scheduled for 2 visits 6 months apart. 

Eight families (8 children) of the 78 children did not agree to 
take part in the assessments other than overnight sleep monitoring. 
Seventy children (40 boys), mean age 5.8 years, range 2.4 to 

10.5 years, completed all the first-visit examinations and comprised 
the initial study group. At the follow-up study 6 months 
later, the same examinations were repeated. At this time, 6 children 
did not participate in the study. Four cases involved a 
protocol violation, and 1 case suffered from technical problems. In 
6 cases, the laboratory or radiograph examinations could not be 
repeated. Thus, 53 children (27 boys), mean age 6.5 years, range 
2.9 to 11.1 years, successfully completed the whole study protocol. 
For the anthropometric measurements and endocrinologic 
studies, 35 children (16 boys) with no health related complaints, 
mean age 6.45, range 1.5 to 10.2 years, recruited from child welfare 
clinics and schools, were used as control subjects.16,17 

An assent from the children in addition to informed consent 
from the parents were obtained. The study protocol was approved 
by the Ethics Committee, Medical Faculty, University of Oulu. The 
study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. 

Methods 

Two visits were scheduled 6 months apart. Based on the results 
from the first visit, the children were recognized as OSAS children 
or primary snorers (PS). The children who were monitored to have 
abnormal sleep were treated surgically, whereas the others were 
observed without intervention. All the baseline measurements 
were repeated on the second visit to evaluate the effects of the 
interventional modalities on the measured parameters. 

All children underwent overnight sleep monitoring in the Department 
of Otorhinolaryngology and a clinical examination for 
anthropometric measurements in the Department of Pediatrics on 
the following morning. Thereafter, the blood samples were drawn, 
and the radiograph for bone age assessment was taken. 

The nocturnal sleep was monitored with a 6-channel computerized 
polygraph with leads for an oro-nasal thermistor, a thoracoabdominal 
strain gauge, pulse oximetry, a body position sensor, 
leg electromyogram (EMG) , and a static charge sensitive bed. 
Channels for electroencephalogram , electro-oculogram, or chin 
EMG tracing were not available. All recordings were manually 
checked by the same clinical neurophysiologist (U.T.). 

An obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (OAHI) of 1 or higher, 
including episodes lasting for 10 seconds or more, was considered 
abnormal in this study based on earlier findings18 and on our own 
reference data.19 Although short obstructive apneas lasting for 5 to 
10 seconds were not included into the criterion index, they were 
also scored. An obstructive apneic episode was defined as complete 
cessation of the oronasal airflow as detected by the thermistor 
in the presence of continuous breathing efforts revealed by 
the thoracoabdominal strain gauge or the static charge sensitive 
bed. Hypopnea was defined as a reduction of at least 50% in the 
airflow signal.20 Mixed apneas and hypopneas starting with a 
central and continuing with an obstructive component were classified 
into the obstructive apnea/hypopnea category. Central apnea 
was defined as cessation of the airflow in the absence of 
breathing efforts. Central apneas were not included into the criterion 
index. Intervals of periodic obstructive hypopneas with a 

50% decrease in the oronasal signal amplitude linked to a pulse 
increase at the termination of the hypopneas were scored. 
All the patients and controls were examined for anthropometric 
measurements. Height was measured to the nearest 1.0 mm with 
a Harpenden wall-mounted stadiometer (Holtain Limited, 
Crymtech, Dyfed, United Kingdom) and weight to the nearest 0.1 
kg with an electronic scale. Relative height (standard deviation 
score [SDS]) and weight for height (%) were assessed from Finnish 
growth charts.21 Target height representing the relative midparental 
height was calculated as follows: TH (standard deviation 
score, SDS) . 
[(height (cm) of mother . 
height (cm) of father)/ 
2–171]/10.22 Target height deficit was target height minus relative 
height at the final evaluation. The data on parental height were 
collected by means of a questionnaire.17 The biceps, triceps, and 
subscapular skin folds were measured to the nearest 0.1 mm with 
a Harpenden skinfold caliper (John Bull, British Indicators Ltd, St 
Albans, Herts, United Kingdom).23 Body mass index (BMI) was 
calculated [weight (kg) divided by height squared (m2)]. Finnish 
age-and gender-matched references were used to assess the relative 
BMI in SDS.24 Body density was calculated from the combined 
triceps and subscapular skin fold thickness values according 
to the method described by Parizkova.25 The percentage of body 
fat was calculated with the method described by Keys and 
Brozek.26 All the anthropometric measurements were performed 3 
times, and the mean value was subsequently used. The stage of 
puberty was ascertained according to Tanner and Whitehouse.27 
Radiologic bone age was assessed from radiographs of the left 
hand and wrist according to Greulich and Pyle.28 

Blood samples were taken on the morning following sleep 
monitoring. Plasma IGF-I concentrations were analyzed with a 
radioimmunoassay using commercial reagents (Incstar Corporation, 
Stillwater, MN) with a sensitivity of 1.0 nmol/L. Serum 
IGFBP-3 concentrations were determined radioimmunologically 
(Diagnostic Systems Laboratories Inc, Webster, TX) with a sensitivity 
of 30 g/L. The methods have intra-assay coefficients of 
variation 5%. Both samples from the same individual were 
analyzed in the same assay, to exclude the effect of interassay 
variation. 

Within a fortnight after the first visit children with OAHI 2 
(19 children) underwent tonsillectomy (and adenoidectomy, if not 
previously performed). Children with OAHI 2 were observed 
without intervention (34 children), including those with mildly 
abnormal sleep monitoring (1OAHI2). 

One child with an OAHI of 2.34 was included in the nonintervention 
group; because of ongoing speech therapy, the speech 
therapist suggested that surgical therapy should be avoided. The 
children served as their own controls. The results from the first 
and the second visits were analyzed within and between the 
groups. 

Statistics 

The data were processed using the SPSS for Windows software 
(SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). Student t test for 2 independent samples 
and paired samples was applied for normally distributed data. 
The nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon signed 
rank tests were used for data with skewed distribution. The Mantel-
Haenszel 2 test was used for ordinal data. Regression analysis 
was applied when the dependent and independent variables were 
continuous, and the residuals ranged from 3 to 3 without obvious 
skewness. 

RESULTS 

First Visit 

Thirty of the children studied had OSAS (OAHI 
1), whereas 40 were considered as PSs (OAHI1; 
Table 1). The relative height and weight for height 
did not differ between the groups (Table 2). The 
OSAS and PS children showed a similar trend toward 
a target height deficit compared with the controls. 
Mean relative height was lower in both groups 
than mean target height. The BMIs were similar in 
the 3 groups (Table 2). All the children studied were 
prepubertal, and the anthropometric data were 
therefore not presented according to sex.

Bone age was only available from 27 children in 
the control group (Table 3). The children with OSAS 
and PS had a retarded relative bone age, whereas the 
controls had an advanced bone age. 

The mean circulating concentrations of IGF-I were 
of the same magnitude in the 3 groups (Table 2). Both 
the OSAS and the PS children had lower IGFBP-3 
concentrations than the control subjects (P . 
.001) 
(Table 2). This was also true after adjustment for age. 
No significant correlation was found between the 
OAHI and the IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 concentrations 
after adjustment for age. 

Follow-up Visit 

On the second visit, significant improvements 
could be seen in the respiratory parameters in the 
surgically treated group of 19 children (OAHI2; 
Table 4). In the nonsurgery group of 34 children 
(OAHI2), no significant changes were observed. 
Weight for height and BMI had increased significantly 
in the operated group (P . 
.001 and P . 
.01, 
respectively). The increase in the weight for height in 

the operated group seemed to be primarily attributable 
to an increase of body fat (P . 
.02); because 
although the mean fat-free mass increased more in 
the operated group, the difference was not significant 
according to the linear regression model with 
age and intervention status as independent variables 
(B . 
0.59; r2 . 
0.21; P . 
.08). Relative height increased 
significantly only in the nonsurgery group 
(P . 
.02). There were no significant changes in bone 
age between the 2 visits in either group. 

The peripheral concentrations of IGF-I and IGFBP-
3 were significantly higher on the second occasion 
in the operated children (P . 
.002 and P .

in the circulating IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels were insignificant. 
The initially significant difference in IGFBP-
3 levels between the operated children and the 
controls (P .

visit (Fig 2). Only in 2 cases (10%) out of 19 were the 
IGF-I and IGFBP-3 concentrations lower on the second 
visit in the operated group, whereas in the non-

DISCUSSION 

Improved growth, especially weight gain, after resolved 
OSAS was accompanied by a significant increase 
in the circulating IGF-I and IGFBP-3 concentrations. 
The pattern of growth improvement after 
surgical treatment of OSAS was consistent with earlier 
studies.6 –11 A detailed analysis of the different 
body mass components showed that the weight increase 
after treatment of OSAS was attributable to an 
increased amount of fat rather than an increase in 
fat-free mass. 

The possible role of abnormal GH secretion in the 
observed growth impairment in OSAS children has 
been addressed in a series of studies.5,7–11 Recently, 
Bar et al9 demonstrated a significant increase in 
weight and serum IGF-1 concentrations after surgical 
treatment of OSAS in 10 prepubertal children. In the 
present study, this was confirmed in 19 children 
operated on and assessed twice. Moreover, 34 children 
with similar symptoms without significant 
OSAS were observed without surgical intervention. 
At baseline, altogether 70 children with obstructive 
sleep disorder were assessed for overnight sleep 
monitoring, and their anthropometric data and 
growth factor concentrations were compared with 
those found in the control subjects.16,17 

GH stimulates the synthesis of IGF-I in the liver 
and other target tissues.29 IGF-I is considered as the 
main mediator of the growth-promoting actions of 
GH,15 reflecting the daily mean GH levels, and it has 
been reported to correlate well with the physiologic 
changes in GH secretion.13 Among prepubertal children, 
IGF-I is not clearly sex-dependent.30 In this 
study, the children remained in prepuberty, when 
the peripheral IGF-I levels increase fairly slowly,30 so 
the increase in age over the relatively short time 
interval between the first and second measurements 
must have very modestly affected the circulating 
IGF-I concentrations, as shown by the insignificant 
increase observed in the nonoperated children. Accordingly, 
the significant increase in peripheral 
IGF-1 levels observed in the operated children suggests 
that the alleviated airway obstruction resulted 
in increased GH secretion. 

IGFBP-3, the GH-dependent major carrier protein 
of IGF-I, has also been shown to correlate significantly 
with nocturnal GH secretion, but not as 
strongly as in the case of IGF-I.14 Although IGFBP-3 
probably exerts some functions of its own on cells, its 
major role is to prolong the half-life of IGF-1.31 The 
major advantage of IGFBP-3 determinations in diagnostics 
is its relative stability over time,14 and it may 
therefore be a more reliable indicator of GH secretion 
over a longer time span than IGF-I. It is also less 
dependent of age than IGF-I.31 In contrast to the 
findings of Bar et al,9 we observed that the IGFBP-3 
concentrations increased significantly along with the 
IGF-I levels in the operated children on the follow-
up, further strengthening the assumption of increased 
GH secretion secondary to the relief of airway 
obstruction. The changes in circulating IGF-I 
and IGFBP-3 concentrations in the follow-up study 
were consistent in the sense that the peripheral concentrations 
only decreased slightly in 2 operated individuals. 


Our findings are consistent with the findings in 
adult OSAS patients, in whom it has been shown that 
successful treatment results in a significant increase 
in nocturnal GH secretion32 and peripheral IGF-I 
levels.33 GH is released in a pulsatile fashion, with 
the initial secretion probably synchronized with the 
onset of slow-wave sleep (SWS), with a strong correlation 
with -wave activity,34 within 90 to 120 minutes 
from the onset of sleep.29 In adults, there is 
convincing evidence of a consistent relationship be

tween SWS and increased GH secretion and decreased 
GH secretion with awakenings.35 In OSAS 
children, the sleep architecture is relatively well-preserved,
36 and the distribution pattern of apneas over 
the night is different from the profile of GH secretion.
29,36 One of the limitations of the methods used 
in this study was the lack of electroencephalogram, 
electro-oculogram, and chin EMG tracing, so the different 
sleep stages could not be differentiated, but 
changes in the proportion of SWS do not seem to be 
significant after treatment of OSAS.37 

Impaired GH secretion is probably not the only 
cause for the failure to thrive, because OSAS children 
may also be obese,38,39 but only the minority was 
overweight in this study. The children classified as 
having OSAS had a higher proportion of body fat, 
but only 2 children had a BMI over 20, 1 girl with 
OSAS (BMI: 21, OAHI: 11.8) and 1 boy who snored 
(BMI: 20.2), and both the OSAS and PS children had 
equal BMIs compared with the control group. 

Increased appetite11 or reduced nighttime caloric 
expenditure could explain some of the increase in fat 
accumulation after the treatment of OSAS.10 However, 
these do not explain the observed changes in 
IGF-I and IGFBP-3 concentrations. The finding that 
relative height increased significantly only in the 
nonoperated group may be attributable to natural 
variation in growth rate, as these children had lower 
relative height at both visits than the OSAS children. 

The fact that no significant differences could be 
observed initially in the anthropometric data or the 
circulating concentrations of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 between 
the children with OSAS and those with primary 
snoring might be explained by sleep abnormalities, 
which were also present in the children 
considered PSs. The children in this study had all 
symptoms suggestive of OSAS, although the majority 
were found to be PSs. This is consistent with the 

findings from other studies,40,41 where half or less of 
the children with such symptoms were actually confirmed 
to have OSAS. The criterion for OSAS, OAHI 
of 1 or higher, was based on normative data established 
by others18 and our own findings in a group of 
30 normal children.19 Coincident desaturation with 
apnea/hypopnea was not a criterion for scoring in 
this study. The mean 4% desaturation index was 
significantly higher in the OSAS group than in the PS 
group, whereas the PS children had a significantly 
higher mean 4% desaturation index than the children 
in our normative data group.19 The PS children had 
also significantly more tachycardic episodes associated 
with prolonged partial obstructive hypoventilation 
than the children in our normative data group,19 
although significantly less than the children with 
OSAS. Some of the PSs could perhaps have been 
classified differently based on the hypoventilation 
criterion,18 despite the lack of significant apneas and 
hypopneas. The significantly reduced IGFBP-3 concentrations 
in the PSs (as well as in the children with 
OSAS) seem to indicate some longer-term abnormality 
in GH secretion also in the PS group. The somewhat 
younger age of the PSs than the controls is 
hardly the explanation, because IGFBP-3 remained 
stable in the nonsurgical group during the follow-up. 
The fact that the snorers showed a similar target 
height deficit and retarded bone age as the children 
with OSAS further supports the idea of long-term 
abnormality in growth regulation also in the PSs. 

The selection of an OAHI of 2 or higher as the 
criteria for surgery in the follow-up study was based 
on the criteria of abnormal OAHI.18,19 The clinical 
impact of mild OSAS is still unknown, which means 
that children with OAHI 2 might well be observed 
for a period of 6 months, whereas symptomatic children 
with more abnormal sleep monitoring results

could hardly be subjected to any follow-up or 
blinded study because of ethical reasons. 

We found here that the circulating IGF-I and IGFBP-
3 concentrations increased significantly in children 
with OSAS after surgical treatment, along with 
a significant increase in weight. These findings suggest 
decreased nocturnal GH secretion secondary to 
upper airway obstruction in children. The mechanisms 
of the initially impaired GH axis have to be 
elucidated in additional studies.
