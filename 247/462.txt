Abstract 


Introduction: 
Snoring 
affects 
biobehavioral 
development 
among 
preschool 
and 
early 
school-age 
children. 
The 
goals 
of 
the 
present 
study 
were 
to 
survey 
the 
parents 
of 
a 
large 
community 
sample 
of 
infants 
and 
young 
toddlers 
to 
evaluate 
(a) 
naturalistic 
sleep 
duration 
and 
location; 
(b) 
snoring 
prevalence; 
and 
(c) 
demographic 
measures 
and 
sleep 
behaviors 
related 
to 
the 
presence 
of 
snoring 
either 
2 
or 
R3 
days/week. 
Methods: 
Questionnaires 
were 
completed 
by 
parents 
of 
children 
ages 
2 
weeks 
to 
2 
years 
attending 
well-baby 
checkups 
and 
were 
also 
mailed 
to 
the 
homes 
of 
six-month-old 
infants. 
Results: 
Data 
from 
944 
children 
were 
available 
for 
analyses. 
No 
age 
differences 
were 
reported 
for 
total 
sleep 
duration, 
co-sleeping, 
or 
snoring. 
Average 
daily 
sleep 
duration 
was12.5G1.8 
h 
(standard 
deviation 
(SD)), 
with 
daytime 
naps 
accounting 
for 
an 
increased 
proportion 
of 
total 
sleep 
duration 
among 
younger 
infants. 
Co-sleeping 
was 
reported 
by 
15% 
of 
families. 
Snoring 
2 
days/week 
was 
reported 
in 
11.8% 
and 
O 
3 
days/week 
in 
5.3% 
of 
participants. 
Survey 
items 
indicating 
risk 
for 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
(SDB) 
clustered 
into 
factors 
related 
to 
the 
child, 
their 
environment, 
and 
their 
family; 
restless 
sleep 
was 
exclusively 
related 
to 
snoring 
2 
days/week 
and 
ethnicity, 
sweating 
during 
sleep, 
and 
noisy 
breathing 
exclusive 
to 
snoring 
R3 
days/week. 
Conclusions: 
Young 
infants 
appear 
to 
sleep 
less 
than 
currently 
recommended. 
Co-sleeping 
is 
relatively 
common 
and 
not 
age-dependent 
through 
the 
first 
2 
years 
of 
life. 
Items 
relating 
to 
the 
child’s 
sleep 
behaviors, 
environment, 
and 
parents’ 
perceptions 
were 
predictive 
of 
positive 
report 
of 
snoring, 
with 
snoring 
rates 
consistent 
with 
a 
significant 
risk 
for 
SDB 
being 
similar 
to 
those 
reported 
for 
older 
children.

Introduction 
Among 
school-age 
children, 
the 
prevalence 
of 
sleep-
disordered 
breathing 
(SDB) 
is 
estimated 
at 
2–3% 
[1,2].Itis 
now 
known 
that 
SDB 
in 
early 
childhood 
leads 
to 
greater 
utilization 
of 
healthcare 
resources 
[3],morefrequent 
cardiovascular 
morbidity 
[4,5] 
and 
co-morbid 
chronic 
illnesses 
[6,7], 
and 
imposes 
deleterious 
consequences 
on 
cognition 
and 
school 
performance 
[8–16], 
as 
well 
as 
greater 
psychiatric 
and 
behavioral 
co-morbidities 
[12,13,17–19].

Although 
recent 
evidence 
points 
to 
reversibility 
of 
many 
of 
these 
morbid 
consequences 
of 
SDB 
in 
children 
[20–23], 
data 
derived 
from 
animal 
models 
of 
SDB 
[24,25] 
and 
one 
epidemiological 
study 
[10] 
suggest 
that 
some 
degree 
of 
long-term 
damage 
may 
occur, 
thereby 
highlighting 
the 
importance 
of 
early 
detection 
and 
timely 
treatment 
of 
pediatric 
SDB. 


Although 
the 
presence 
of 
a 
history 
of 
snoring 
is 
insufficient 
for 
establishing 
the 
diagnosis 
of 
SDB, 
this 
symptom 
is 
considered 
a 
cardinal 
feature 
of 
SDB 
[26]. 
Snoring 
at 
frequencies 
consistent 
with 
a 
measurable 
risk 
for 
SDB 
have 
been 
reported 
in 
6–27% 
of 
children 
[2,6,9,14]. 
Nevertheless, 
we 
should 
caution 
that 
even 
primary 
snoring 
appears 
to 
be 
associated 
with 
some 
degree 
of 
disruption 
of 
sleep 
microarchitecture 
that 
ultimately 
may 
affect 
daytime 
functioning 
in 
children 
[27]. 
Furthermore, 
an 
emerging 
body 
of 
work 
among 
school-age 
children 
indicates 
that 
mild 
SDB 
and 
primary 
snoring, 
exclusive 
of 
obstructive 
sleep

apnea 
(OSA), 
may 
impair 
executive 
function 
[28], 
verbal 
and 
global 
IQ 
and 
memory 
[29], 
attention 
[16,29], 
and 
contributes 
to 
social 
problems 
and 
anxious/depressive 
symptoms 
[16]. 


Similar 
to 
older 
children, 
a 
5–26% 
prevalence 
of 
snoring 
has 
been 
reported 
among 
community 
infants 
[2,30,31]. 
More 
recently, 
we 
have 
also 
found 
that 
higher 
snore-related 
arousal 
indices 
are 
associated 
with 
more 
negative 
indices 
on 
an 
assessment 
of 
mental 
development 
in 
eight-month-old 
infants, 
even 
when 
overnight 
polysomnographic 
evaluation 
fails 
to 
reveal 
the 
presence 
of 
any 
obstructive 
apneas 
or 
hypopneas 
[32]. 


The 
goals 
of 
the 
present 
study 
were 
to 
survey 
a 
large 
community 
sample 
to 
evaluate 
(a) 
naturalistic 
sleep 
duration 
and 
locations; 
(b) 
snoring 
prevalence; 
and 
(c) 
whether 
other 
demographic, 
environmental, 
and 
parent-reported 
infant 
and 
young 
toddler 
sleep 
behaviors 
are 
associated 
with 
snoring 
rates 
that 
are 
either 
consistent 
with 
primary 
snoring 
or 
likely 
to 
indicate 
SDB. 


2. 
Methods 
The 
study 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
Institutional 
Review 
Boards 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Louisville 
and 
at 
Clark 
Memorial 
Hospital, 
Baptist 
Hospital 
East, 
Floyd 
Memorial 
Hospital, 
Norton 
Healthcare, 
Norton 
Suburban 
Hospital, 
and 
University 
of 
Louisville 
Hospital. 
A 
preamble 
letter 
describing 
implied 
consent 
accompanied 
the 
screening 
survey. 


2.1. 
Survey 
instrument 
and 
coding 
The 
instrument 
included 
parent 
and 
child 
demographics 
and 
child 
sleep 
behaviors. 
Survey 
items, 
response 
options 
and 
numerical 
coding 
(in 
italics) 
are 
in 
Appendix 
A. 
The 
survey 
was 
filled 
out 
with 
standard 
intake 
paperwork 
by 
parents 
of 
children 
ages 
2 
weeks 
through 
2 
years 
attending 
well-baby 
checkups 
at 
four 
multiple-provider 
private 
pediatric 
practices 
and 
one 
public 
health 
center. 
A 
letter 
suggesting 
they 
discuss 
the 
symptom 
with 
their 
child’s 
primary 
care 
physician 
was 
sent 
to 
parents 
who 
reported 
that 
their 
child 
snored 
‘frequently’ 
or 
‘almost 
always’ 
and 
also 
copied 
to 
the 
pediatrician. 


The 
survey 
was 
also 
mailed 
to 
the 
homes 
of 
infants 
born 
at 
one 
of 
six 
local 
community 
hospitals, 
whose 
parents 
indicated 
interest 
in 
the 
study 
by 
returning 
a 
reply 
card 
included 
in 
their 
hospital 
discharge 
packet; 
surveys 
were 
sent 
to 
these 
homes 
when 
the 
infant 
reached 
six 
months 
of 
age 
and 
were 
returned 
via 
postage–paid 
mail 
to 
the 
research 
office. 
Parents 
who 
reported 
‘frequent’ 
or 
‘almost 
always’ 
snoring 
were 
either 
invited 
to 
participate 
in 
a 
larger 
study, 
or 
encouraged 
to 
discuss 
the 
symptom 
with 
their 
child’s 
physician. 


2.2. 
Statistical 
analyses 
Descriptive 
statistics 
were 
calculated. 
One-way 
analysis 
of 
variance 
(ANOVA) 
was 
used 
to 
compare 
continuous 
measures 
and 
effects 
sizes 
were 
calculated 
using 
Cohen’s 
d. 
Principal 
component 
analysis 
was 
run 
on 
coded 
measures. 
Data 
were 
analyzed 
using 
SPSS 
version 
13.0; 
factor 
loading 
was 
considered 
significant 
atR.50. 
A 
P!.05 
was 
consideredsignificantinall 
cases. 
Cohen’s 
d!0.2 
was 
considered 
trivial, 
0.2–0.4 
was 
considered 
small, 
0.5–0.8 
was 
considered 
moderate, 
and 
O0.8 
was 
considered 
strong. 


3. 
Results 
There 
were 
1,038 
survey 
respondents. 
Due 
to 
the 
distribution 
methods 
and 
restrictions 
on 
tracking 
nonparticipants, 
the 
response 
rate 
is 
unknown. 
Thirty-four 
respondents 
declined 
to 
answer 
the 
question 
about 
their 
child 
snoring. 
Sixty 
reported 
a 
respiratory 
infection 
currently 
or 
within 
2 
weeks 
of 
survey 
completion; 
26.7 
and 
9.9% 
of 
these 
were 
reported 
to 
snore 
2 
days/week 
and 
R3 
days/week, 
respectively 
and 
were 
excluded 
from 
analyses. 
There 
were 
944 
surveys 
distributed 
over 
10 
standard 
check-up 
time-points 
from 
2 
weeks 
to 
2 
years 
available 
for 
analyses 
(Table 
1). 


There 
was 
no 
age 
effect 
for 
reported 
duration 
of 
sleep 
over 
a 
period 
of 
24 
h 
(time 
from 
bedtime 
to 
rise 
time 
plus 
the 
number 
of 
daytime 
naps 
multiplied 
by 
the 
usual 
length 
of 
each 
nap). 
The 
proportion 
of 
24-h 
sleep 
duration 
accounted 
for 
by 
daytime 
naps 
decreased 
across 
ages 
(FZ 
12.5, 
P!0.001), 
as 
did 
the 
number 
of 
reported 
nocturnal 
awakenings 
(FZ16.1, 
P!0.001). 
One 
or 
more 
nocturnal 
awakenings 
were 
reported 
by 
parents 
of 
49.4% 
of 
12month-
olds 
and 
45.9% 
of 
24-month-olds. 
There 
was 
large 
variation 
on 
all 
nocturnal 
sleep 
and 
daytime 
nap 
measures 
(Table 
2, 
Fig. 
1). 
There 
was 
a 
difference 
between 
maternal 
education; 
children 
of 
mothers 
with 
a 
high 
school 
education 
or 
less 
(NZ224) 
had 
shorter 
nap 
durations 
than 
those 
with 
education 
beyond 
high 
school 
(NZ588) 
(FZ6.4, 
PZ.011,

There 
were 
no 
statistically 
significant

in 
co-sleeping

(Table

who 
were

42.4% 
slept

Three 
infants 
had 
diagnosed

Snoring

11.8% 
of 
subjects; 
5.3% 
were 
reported 
to 
snore 
R3

(Table

The 
following 
magnitude 
differences 
are 
for 
combined 
snoring 
rates 
(R2 
days/week): 
forty-five 
percent 
of 
snoring 
subjects 
and 
31% 
of 
non-snorers 
had 
at 
least 
one 
parent 
who 
smoked 
(c 
2Z10.3, 
PZ0.002). 
Eighty-one 
percent 
of 
snoring 
subjects 
and 
55% 
of 
non-snorers 
had 
at 
least 
one 
parent 
who 
snored 
(c 
2Z36.2, 
P!0.001). 
Maternal 
age 
and 
education 
were 
lower 
among 
snorers 
(FZ5.5, 
PZ 
.019, 
dZ.20; 
FZ15.3, 
P!.001, 
dZ.35, 
respectively). 
The 
number 
of 
breast 
feedings 
per 
day 
was 
lower 
among 
snorers 
(FZ7.6, 
PZ0.006, 
dZ.27). 
Seventy-five 
percent 
of 
snorers 
and 
90% 
non-snorers 
had 
parents 
who 
thought 
their 
child’s 
sleep 
was 
‘frequently’ 
or 
‘almost 
always’ 
normal 
(c 
2Z33.6, 
P!.001). 
Seventeen 
percent 
of 
snorers’ 
parents 
and 
4.4% 
of 
non-snorers’ 
parents 
reported 
being 
concerned 
about 
their 
child’s 
breathing 
during 
sleep 
‘frequently’ 
or 
‘almost 
always’ 
(c 
2Z40.5,

Among 
snorers, 
neither 
maternal

differed 
between 
those 
who

Discussion 
The 
24-h 
sleep 
durations 
for 
infants 
and 
young 
toddlers 
found 
in 
the 
present 
study 
are 
shorter 
than 
the 
commonly 
recommended 
durations 
of 
sleep 
[33] 
and 
those 
found 
in 
a 
recent 
large-scale 
longitudinal 
survey 
report 
of 
data 
from 
Zurich 
[34] 
but 
were 
consistent 
with 
current 
data 
and 
similar 
to 
those 
reported 
in 
the 
recent 
National 
Sleep 
Foundation’s 
(NSF) 
‘Sleep 
in 
America’ 
Poll 
[35]. 
We 
speculate 
that 
the 
questionnaire 
methods 
may 
explain 
some 
of 
these 
discrepancies. 
The 
present 
study 
elicited 
values 
for 
nocturnal 
sleep 
and 
daytime 
naps 
separately; 
nocturnal 
sleep 
was 
further 
verified 
with 
bedtime 
and 
rise 
time 
values, 
and 
naps 
were 
broken 
down 
into 
number 
and 
duration. 
Napping 
has 
previously 
been 
shown 
to 
have 
a 
robust 
pattern 
[36], 
and 
the 
mean 
values 
from 
our 
data 
are 
consistent 
with 
this 
previous 
report 
in 
terms 
of 
both 
the 
number 
of 
naps 
and 
the 
nap

The 
trivial 
effect 
size 
for 
difference 
between 
maternal 
education 
and 
nap 
duration 
does 
not 
explain 
our 
finding 
that 
the 
total 
24-h 
sleep 
times 
did 
not 
change 
from 
birth 
through 
24 
months. 
Further 
validation 
of 
parental 
report 
of 
their 
child’s 
sleep 
duration 
is 
clearly 
needed. 
The 
differences 
may 
also 
be 
culturally 
related; 
Italian 
infants 
from 
0–5 
months 
have 
been 
reported 
to 
have 
the 
same 
total 
sleep 
time 
as 
described 
in 
these 
data, 
although 
that 
group 
did 
report 
a 
decline 
in 
total 
sleep 
time 
across 
age, 
which 
we 
did 
not 
find 
[37]. 
Since 
there 
is 
no 
conclusive 
evidence 
that 
indicates 
that 
sleep 
duration 
below 
a 
certain 
threshold 
in 
this 
age 
range 
is 
non-optimal 
or 
imposes 
particular 
morbidities, 
it 
is 
difficult 
to 
justify 
the 
current 
recommendations 
made 
to 
parents 
supporting 
sleep 
durations 
of 
16 
h/day. 
Indeed, 
such 
a 
priori 
excessive 
expectations 
could 
lead 
parents 
to 
manage 
their 
child 
sleep 
routines 
inappropriately 
and 
consequently 
induce 
sleep 
problems 
later 
in 
life, 
or 
potentially 
could 
lead 
to 
the 
erroneous 
belief 
that 
their 
children 
suffer 
from 
a 
sleep 
disorder. 
Further 
research 
is 
clearly 
needed 
to 
clarify 
the 
normal 
distribution 
of 
sleep 
duration 
in 
this 
young 
population. 


In 
the 
present 
sample, 
one 
of 
every 
10 
children 
between 
the 
ages 
of 
2 
weeks 
and 
2 
years 
exclusively 
slept 
in 
the 
parental 
bed, 
and 
an 
additional 
5% 
slept 
in 
their 
parents’ 
bed 
at 
least 
part 
of 
the 
time. 
The 
prevalence 
of 
co-sleeping 
found 
herein 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
NSF 
report 
for 
toddlers 
but 
somewhat 
lower 
than 
the 
16% 
reported 
for 
infants 
[35].It 
remains 
unclear 
from 
either 
of 
these 
two 
surveys 
what 
proportion 
of 
co-sleeping 
in 
this 
age 
range 
occurs 
by 
choice 
or 
by 
necessity. 
Both 
of 
these 
recent 
studies 
found 
cosleeping 
rates 
lower 
than 
35% 
for 
Caucasian 
and 
lower 
than 
70% 
for 
African-American 
families 
as 
previously 
reported 
by 
Lozoff 
and 
colleagues 
[38]. 
We 
also 
did 
not 
find 
any 
evidence 
for 
demographic 
differences 
in 
our 
study. 
The 
effect 
of 
maternal 
age, 
education 
and 
breastfeeding 
on 
the 


prevalence 
of 
exclusive 
co-sleeping 
was 
small. 
It 
should 
be 
noted 
that 
co-sleeping 
has 
become 
a 
contentious 
issue 
both 
within 
the 
research 
community 
and 
among 
parenting 
groups 
around 
the 
world. 
The 
purpose 
of 
the 
present 
study 
was 
merely 
to 
assess 
current 
sleep 
practices 
among 
community 
parents 
in 
a 
typical 
population 
in 
the 
United 
States; 
a 
comprehensive 
discussion 
of 
co-sleeping 
issues 
is 
clearly 
beyond 
the 
scope 
of 
this 
study. 
However, 
the 
relatively 
high 
proportion 
of 
children 
reported 
to 
be 
co-sleeping 
with 
their 
parents 
further 
emphasizes 
the 
need 
for 
community 
education 
regarding 
safe 
co-sleeping 
practices. 
This 
appears 
to 
be 
particularly 
important 
considering 
that 
despite 
the 
extensive 
efforts 
of 
the 
Back-to-Sleep 
campaign 
in 
the 
United 
States, 
20% 
of 
the 
parents 
of 
infants 
four 
months 
and 
younger 
report 
that 
their 
children 
routinely 
sleep 
in 
the 
prone 
position. 
Parenthetically, 
data 
were 
not 
available 
to 
determine 
the 
sleeping 
positions 
of 
infants 
in 
this 
age 
group 
who 
were 
also 
co-sleeping. 


In 
a 
previous 
study 
we 
showed 
that 
parental 
reports 
of 
‘frequent’ 
and 
‘almost 
always’ 
(R3 
days/week) 
snoring, 
using 
a 
standard 
survey 
questionnaire, 
reliably 
predict 
SDB 
in 
both 
preschool 
and 
early 
school-age 
children 
[15].In 
contrast, 
the 
presence 
of 
‘occasional’ 
(2 
days/week) 
snoring 
was 
associated 
with 
the 
presence 
of 
snoring 
during 
sleep 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
altered 
sleep 
architecture 
or 
cardiorespiratory 
abnormalities 
(i.e. 
primary 
snoring) 
during 
standard, 
overnight 
polysomnography 
[15]. 
The 
previous 
work 
has 
been 
thoroughly 
validated 
for 
use 
with 
preschool 
and 
early 
school 
age 
children 
but 
has 
not 
been 
validated 
on 
children 
younger 
than 
3 
years. 
However, 
a 
subset 
of 
the 
questions 
were 
used 
for 
this 
survey 
to 
find 
that 
approximately 
12% 
of 
healthy 
community 
children 
from 
birth 
to 
2 
years 
were 
reported 
to 
snore 
at 
a 
frequency 
consistent 
with 
a 
polysomnographic 
(PSG) 
diagnosis 
of 
primary 
snoring 
in 
older 
children, 
while 
an 
additional 
5% 
were 
reported 
to 
snore 
at 
a 
weekly 
frequency 
suggesting 
the 
presence 
of 
increased 
risk 
for 
SDB. 
These 
rates 
are 
similar 
to 
previous 
studies, 
whereby

habitual 
snoring 
was 
reported 
in 
w5% 
of 
both 
2–4-montholds 
[30] 
and 
6–12-month-olds 
[2]. 
Similarly, 
among 
1800 
infants 
from 
1–8 
months 
in 
New 
Zealand, 
16% 
were 
reported 
to 
snore 
during 
their 
first 
month 
of 
life 
and 
26% 
to 
have 
snored 
during 
the 
2 
weeks 
preceding 
the 
interview 
[31]. 


Snoring 
in 
infancy 
has 
been 
related 
to 
male 
gender, 
maternal 
cigarette 
smoking, 
prone 
or 
supine 
sleeping, 
respiratory 
infections, 
and 
whether 
the 
infant 
snored 
during 
the 
first 
month 
of 
life 
[31]. 
While 
we 
did 
not 
find 
gender 
or 
body-position 
differences 
in 
the 
current 
study, 
our 
data 
confirm 
the 
findings 
of 
increased 
rates 
of 
snoring 
in 
association 
with 
respiratory 
infection 
and 
with 
living 
in 
a 
cigarette 
smoking 
household. 
In 
addition, 
we 
found 
that 
items 
relating 
to 
the 
child’s 
sleep 
behaviors, 
environment, 
and 
parents’ 
perceptions 
were 
predictive 
of 
positive 
report 
of 
snoring, 
with 
several 
items 
differentiating 
between 
snoring 
frequencies. 


The 
replication 
of 
the 
association 
between 
snoring 
and 
cigarette 
smoking 
is 
particularly 
interesting. 
A 
negative 
relationship 
between 
snore-related 
arousal 
indices 
in 
the 
PSG 
and 
cognitive 
development, 
but 
not 
for 
the 
presence 
of 
snoring 
per 
se, 
was 
found 
in 
infants 
and 
suggests 
that 
sleep 
fragmentation 
induced 
by 
snoring 
may 
underlie 
neurobehavioral 
deficits 
[32]. 
However, 
a 
greater 
number 
of 
those 
infants 
whose 
snoring 
induced 
arousals 
lived 
in 
cigarette 
smoking 
households 
[32]. 
The 
present 
survey 
was 
not 
designed 
to 
gather 
extensive 
information 
about 
the 
exact 
levels 
of 
exposure 
to 
second-hand 
cigarette 
smoke, 
thus 
it 
is 
possible, 
for 
example, 
that 
exposures 
related 
to 
a 
smoking 
grandparent 
living 
in 
the 
home 
or 
a 
child 
spending 
significant 
time 
in 
the 
home 
of 
a 
smoking 
daycare 
provider 
would 
be 
missed. 
Additionally, 
no 
information 
was 
gathered 
regarding 
maternal 
cigarette 
smoking 
or 
exposure 
to 
second-hand 
cigarette 
smoke 
during 
pregnancy. 
However, 
current 
findings 
highlight 
the 
link 
between 
cigarette 
smoking 
exposure 
and 
increased 
upper 
airway 
resistance 
during 
sleep. 


Several 
limitations 
in 
the 
present 
study 
merit 
discussion. 
First, 
no 
survey 
questions 
have 
been 
formally 
validated 
for 
use 
with 
children 
!3 
years 
of 
age. 
However, 
the 
question 
‘How 
often 
does 
your 
child 
snore?’ 
showed 
robust 
predictive 
validity 
invulnerable 
to 
age 
among 
children 
3–8 
years 
old 
during 
validation 
procedures 
[15]. 
Second, 
the 
precise 
survey 
response 
rate 
is 
unknown 
and 
this 
may 
have 
had 
an 
effect 
on 
the 
study 
results. 
Although 
office 
staff 
members 
at 
the 
participating 
pediatric 
clinics 
estimated 
that 
O80% 
of 
their 
patients 
filled 
out 
the 
survey, 
Health 
Information 
Portability 
and 
Accountability 
Act 
(HIPAA) 
legislation 
prevented 
tracking 
these 
numbers 
at 
either 
the 
clinics 
or 
hospitals. 
It 
is 
also 
possible 
that 
there 
were 
differences 
between 
subjects 
who 
filled 
out 
the 
survey 
at 
a 
well-baby 
office 
visit 
compared 
to 
those 
who 
filled 
it 
out 
in 
their 
home. 
While 
a 
selection 
bias 
is 
possible 
and 
cannot 
be 
excluded 
with 
certainty, 
our 
sleep 
times 
and 
snoring 
rate 
results 
are 
consistent 
with 
those 
previously 
reported 
by 
other 
investigators 
[2,30,31,35]. 
Finally, 
despite 
inclusion 
of 
a 
public 
health 
center 
serving 
an 
almost 
exclusively 
minority 
population, 
the 
survey 


participants 
were 
predominantly 
Caucasian. 
Considering 
the 
ethnic 
differences 
in 
snoring 
rates 
found 
herein 
and 
the 
disproportionate 
risk 
of 
SDB 
among 
African-American 
children 
[14,39], 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
the 
snoring 
rates 
reported 
herein 
may 
be 
somewhat 
underestimated. 


Our 
current 
findings 
support 
the 
need 
for 
further 
identification 
and 
evaluation 
of 
very 
young 
children 
in 
whom 
risk 
factors 
for 
SDB 
are 
present, 
a 
process 
that 
appears 
to 
be 
fraught 
with 
formidable 
challenges. 
Children 
under 
1 
year 
old 
are 
specifically 
excluded 
from 
the 
recent 
American 
Academy 
of 
Pediatrics 
guidelines 
for 
diagnosis 
and 
management 
of 
SDB 
in 
childhood 
[40]. 
Co-morbidities 
associated 
with 
SDB, 
such 
as 
recurrent 
upper 
respiratory 
tract 
infection 
and 
delays 
in 
growth 
and 
development, 
are 
often 
the 
presenting 
complaints 
that 
lead 
to 
diagnosis 
of 
SDB 
in 
children 
[41]. 
Lower 
maternal 
education 
and 
cigarette 
smoke 
exposure, 
both 
of 
which 
were 
associated 
with 
the 
presence 
of 
snoring 
in 
the 
present 
study, 
were 
also 
found 
as 
risk 
factors 
for 
sustained 
snoring 
in 
primary 
school 
children 
[42]. 
Unfortunately, 
parental 
education 
about 
symptoms 
of 
SDB 
is 
lacking. 
Indeed, 
only 
8% 
of 
parents 
of 
children 
with 
a 
significant 
history 
of 
snoring 
mentioned 
this 
symptom 
during 
a 
checkup 
preceding 
a 
research 
exit 
interview 
in 
a 
study 
of 
older 
children 
[43]. 
Although 
rates 
of 
parental 
concern 
about 
the 
child’s 
breathing 
were 
higher 
among 
parents 
of 
snorers 
compared 
to 
non-snorers, 
they 
were 
still 
relatively 
low. 


In 
summary, 
snoring 
rates 
consistent 
with 
risk 
for 
SDB 
are 
reported 
by 
parents 
of 
healthy 
infants 
and 
young 
toddlers 
at 
rates 
similar 
to 
those 
reported 
for 
older 
children, 
and 
thereby 
suggest 
a 
similar 
risk 
for 
SDB. 
Therefore, 
further 
objective 
assessments 
on 
the 
prevalence 
of 
SDB 
in 
this 
age 
range 
are 
essential 
to 
define 
the 
magnitude 
of 
the 
problem 
and 
the 
natural 
history 
of 
snoring 
in 
young 
children 
and 
to 
allow 
for 
formulation 
of 
sound 
policies 
regarding 
evaluation 
and 
treatment.
