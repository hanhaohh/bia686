Objective: 
To 
review 
our 
experience 
with 
intracapsular 
tonsillectomy 
using 
powered 
instrumentation 
in 
the 
management 
of 
tonsillar 
hypertrophy 
causing 
obstructive 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
in 
children. 
Study 
Design: 
Retrospective 
case 
series. 
Methods: 
Intracapsular 
tonsillectomy, 
a 
form 
of 
partial 
tonsillectomy 
performed 
with 
an 
endoscopic 
microdebrider, 
preserves 
the 
tonsillar 
capsule 
as 
a 
barrier 
to 
exposure 
of 
the 
pharyngeal 
muscles. 
Results 
in 
150 
children 
who 
underwent 
this 
procedure 
were 
compared 
with 
those 
in 
162 
children 
who 
had 
standard 
tonsillectomy. 
Results: 
Children 
who 
underwent 
intracapsular 
tonsillectomy 
had 
significantly 
less 
pain 
throughout 
the 
recovery 
period 
than 
those 
who 
had 
standard 
tonsillectomy. 
There 
was 
no 
significant 
difference 
between 
the 
two 
groups 
in 
intraoperative 
blood 
loss, 
and 
no 
episodes 
of 
immediate 
postoperative 
bleeding 
occurred 
in 
either 
group. 
Six 
patients 
who 
had 
the 
standard 
operation 
and 
one 
patient 
who 
had 
the 
intracapsular 
procedure 
had 
delayed 
hemorrhage 
requiring 
hospital 
readmission. 
Five 
children 
in 
the 
standard 
group 
and 
one 
in 
the 
intracapsular 
group 
were 
readmitted 
because 
of 
dehydration. 
Thus, 
in 
all, 
11 
readmissions 
were 
necessary 
among 
children 
who 
underwent 
standard 
tonsillectomy, 
whereas 
2 
were 
required 
among 
those 
who 
had 
intracapsular 
tonsillectomy. 
Conclusion: 
Intracapsular 
tonsillectomy 
is 
as 
effective 
as 
standard 
tonsillectomy 
in 
relieving 
obstructive 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
but 
produces 
less 
postoperative 
pain 
and 
fewer 
episodes 
of 
delayed 
hemorrhage 
and 
dehydration.

“achieves 
the 
functional 
result 
of 
reduction 
in 
tonsillar 
volume. 
. 
.without 
the 
morbidity 
of 
pain 
and 
bleeding 
frequently 
experienced 
with 
conventional 
excisions.” 
In 
our 
experience, 
however, 
standard 
tonsillectomy 
using 
a 
laser 
resulted 
in 
a 
conventional 
recovery, 
an 
observation 
indicating 
that 
it 
was 
the 
partial 
nature 
of 
the 
LAST, 
rather 
than 
use 
of 
the 
laser, 
that 
reduced 
the 
discomfort. 
Therefore, 
we 
began 
to 
perform 
“partial” 
tonsillectomies 
for 
hypertrophy 
in 
children 
under 
3 
years 
of 
age. 
For 
this 
procedure, 
we 
selected 
an 
endoscopic 
microdebrider, 
a 
device 
we 
had 
been 
using 
for 
transoral 
power-assisted 
adenoidectomy.
2 
Our 
patients 
generally 
had 
an 
easy 
and 
rapid 
recovery, 
although 
tonsil 
regrowth 
did 
occur 
in 
one 
child. 


In 
1998, 
Linder 
et 
al.3 
reported 
use 
of 
a 
CO2 
laser 
for 
“tonsillotomy” 
(partial 
tonsillectomy) 
in 
33 
children, 
observing 
that 
this 
procedure 
relieved 
the 
obstruction 
without 
bleeding 
and 
with 
minimal 
pain. 
Because 
of 
this 
and 
a 
follow-up 
report,4 
we 
expanded 
our 
age 
range 
for 
partial 
tonsillectomy. 
In 
the 
present 
report, 
we 
describe 
a 
retrospective 
comparison 
of 
partial 
(“intracapsular”) 
tonsillectomy 
and 
standard 
tonsillectomy 
in 
312 
children. 


PATIENTS 
AND 
METHODS 


Patients 


We 
reviewed 
the 
medical 
records 
of 
all 
children 
(n 
. 
150, 
group 
1) 
who 
underwent 
intracapsular 
tonsillectomy 
for 
tonsillar 
hypertrophy 
causing 
obstructive 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
performed 
by 
the 
same 
surgeon 
(P.J.K.) 
at 
the 
same 
hospital 
between 
October 
1998 
and 
May 
2001. 
For 
comparison, 
we 
reviewed 
the 
records 
of 
all 
children 
(n 
. 
162, 
group 
2) 
who 
underwent 
standard 
tonsillectomy 
performed 
by 
the 
same 
surgeon 
during 
the 
same 
period 
at 
the 
same 
hospital. 
We 
also 
conducted 
a 
telephone 
survey 
of 
primary 
caregivers 
of 
the 
children 
(132 
[88% 
of 
caregivers] 
in 
group 
1 
and 
137 
[84.6%] 
in 
group 
2) 
by 
using 
a 
questionnaire 
that 
elicited 
their 
assessment 
of 
their 
children’s 
postoperative 
recovery. 


Data 
collected 
from 
the 
records 
were 
patient’s 
age, 
sex, 
and 
primary 
diagnosis; 
amount 
of 
intraoperative 
blood 
loss; 
intraoperative 
and 
subsequent 
complications; 
days 
until 
return 
to 
normal 
activity 
and 
diet; 
number 
of 
days 
of 
analgesic 
use; 
and 
pain 
during 
recovery 
(on 
postoperative 
days 
1–3, 
4 
–6, 
7–9, 
after 
day 
9, 
and 
overall).

Surgical 
Technique 


Orotracheal 
intubation 
is 
performed 
with 
the 
child 
in 
the 
Rose 
position. 
A 
mouth 
gag 
is 
used 
to 
retract 
the 
jaw. 
The 
soft 
palate 
is 
retracted 
with 
catheters 
in 
anticipation 
of 
a 
concurrent 
adenoidectomy, 
and 
this 
stabilizes 
the 
tonsil 
and 
pulls 
the 
uvula 
out 
of 
the 
way. 
Resection 
begins 
with 
the 
left-side 
tonsil, 
with 
the 
microdebrider 
(set 
to 
1500 
rpm 
in 
oscillating 
mode) 
held 
in 
the 
right 
hand, 
and 
moves 
from 
the 
inferior 
to 
the 
superior 
pole, 
starting 
medially 
and 
proceeding 
laterally. 
When 
the 
plane 
of 
the 
pillars 
has 
been 
reached, 
a 
Hurd 
elevator 
is 
used 
to 
retract 
the 
anterior 
pillar, 
medialize 
the 
remaining 
tonsil, 
and 
allow 
deeper 
portions 
of 
the 
tonsillar 
tissue 
to 
be 
shaved. 
Care 
is 
taken 
to 
leave 
a 
thin 
rim 
of 
lymphoid 
tissue 
on 
the 
tonsillar 
capsule. 
After 
resection 
has 
been 
completed, 
suction 
cautery 
is 
used 
to 
control 
the 
bleeding 
from 
the 
left-side 
tonsillar 
bed. 
The 
right-side 
tonsil 
is 
then 
similarly 
resected, 
with 
the 
microdebrider 
held 
in 
the 
left 
hand. 
Power-assisted 
adenoidectomy 
is 
performed 
after 
the 
intracapsular 
tonsillectomy. 


Statistical 
Analysis 


Simple 
associations 
between 
categorical 
variables 
were 
assessed 
with 
the 
!2 
or 
Fisher’s 
exact 
test, 
as 
appropriate; 
those 
between 
categorical 
and 
ordinal 
variables 
were 
analyzed 
with 
the 
Mann-Whitney 
or 
Kruskal-Wallis 
test. 
Groups 
1 
and 
2 
were 
compared 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
ordinal 
outcomes 
and 
the 
continuous 
variables 
of 
days 
to 
return 
to 
normal 
activity 
and 
diet 
by 
using 
the 
Mantel-Haenszel 
test, 
with 
adjustment 
for 
any 
significant 
categorical 
predictors. 
In 
addition, 
patients 
in 
group 
1 
were 
compared 
with 
a 
subset 
of 
patients 
in 
group 
2 
who 
had 
preoperative 
tonsillar 
hypertrophy 
with 
obstructive 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
without 
chronic 
tonsillitis 
(n 
. 
51). 
Data 
are 
reported 
as

for 
continuous 
variables 
and

for

A

was 
used 
for 
all 
hypotheses. 


RESULTS 


Seventy-eight 
boys 
(52%) 
and 
72 
girls 
(48%) 
had 
intracapsular 
tonsillectomy 
(group 
1), 
and 
86 
boys 
(53.1%) 
and 
76 
girls 
(46.9%) 
had 
total 
tonsillectomy 
(group 
2) 
(P 
. 
.85). 
Age 
at 
surgery 
was 
6.0 
. 
2.5 
years 
in 
group 
1 
and 
was 
8.9 
. 
2.9 
years 
in 
group 
2 
(P 
#.001). 
The 
median 
amount 
of 
intraoperative 
blood 
loss 
was 
25 
mL 
in 
group 
1 
and 
was 
30 
mL 
in 
group 
2 
(P 
. 
.51). 
No 
episodes 
of 
immediate 
postoperative 
bleeding 
occurred 
in 
either 
group. 
Six 
patients 
who 
underwent 
standard 
tonsillectomy 
had 
delayed 
postoperative 
hemorrhage 
requiring 
hospital 
readmission, 
whereas 
one 
patient 
who 
underwent 
intracapsular 
tonsillectomy 
was 
readmitted 
for 
delayed 
bleeding 
(P 
. 
.13). 
Five 
patients 
in 
group 
1 
and 
one 
patient 
in 
group 
2 
required 
readmission 
because 
of 
dehydration 
(P 
. 
.22). 
Thus, 
in 
all, 
there 
were 
11 
readmissions 
(7% 
readmission 
rate) 
among 
children 
who 
underwent 
standard 
tonsillectomy 
and 
2 
readmissions 
(1%) 
among 
children 
who 
had 
intracapsular 
tonsillectomy. 
No 
other 
tonsillectomy-related 
complications 
occurred 
in 
either 
group. 


The 
children 
in 
group 
1 
had 
less 
pain 
at 
each 
postoperative 
assessment 
time 
and 
overall 
than 
those 
in 
group 
2(P 
#.01). 
In 
addition, 
children 
in 
group 
1 
had 
less 
pain 
on 
days 
1 
to 
3 
(P 
. 
.013) 
and 
on 
days 
4 
to 
6 
(P 
. 
.036) 
postoperatively 
than 
the 
51 
children 
in 
group 
2 
with 
tonsillar 
hypertrophy 
with 
obstructive 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
without

DISCUSSION 


In 
1930, 
Fowler5 
described 
the 
“modern” 
tonsillectomy 
as 
removing 
“the 
tonsil, 
the 
whole 
tonsil, 
and 
nothing 
but 
the 
tonsil,” 
a 
procedure 
that 
involved 
an 
anatomical 
dissection 
in 
the 
specific 
surgical 
plane 
between 
the 
pharyngeal 
muscle 
and 
the 
tonsillar 
capsule. 
The 
emphasis 
on 
complete 
tonsillectomy 
in 
the 
era 
before 
antibiotics, 
when 
tonsillectomies 
were 
performed 
primarily 
for 
chronic 
infections, 
was 
based 
on 
the 
observation 
that 
after 
subtotal 
resection, 
tonsillar 
remnants 
could 
become 
reinfected 
and 
be 
a 
source 
of 
persistent 
disease. 
However, 
tonsillectomy 
continued 
to 
frustrate 
surgeons 
because 
of 
two 
unresolved 
problems: 
prolonged 
pain 
and 
delayed 
hemorrhage.6–9 
These 
problems 
are 
a 
consequence 
of 
the 
fundamental 
design 
of 
the 
standard 
tonsillectomy 
and 
result 
from 
infection 
and 
inflammation 
of 
the 
exposed 
swallow 
musculature 
attributable 
to 
pharyngeal 
secretions. 
Pain-free 
recovery 
does 
not 
occur 
until 
the 
muscles 
have 
remucosalized. 
Similarly, 
patients 
remain 
vulnerable 
to 
bleeding 
until 
the 
severed 
stumps 
of 
the 
primary 
tonsillar 
vessels 
have 
healed. 


In 
contrast, 
intracapsular 
tonsillectomy 
preserves 
the 
tonsillar 
capsule, 
avoiding 
direct 
surgical 
violation 
of 
pharyngeal 
muscles 
and 
providing 
a 
biological 
“dressing” 
that 
keeps 
the 
muscles 
isolated 
from 
secretions. 
This 
prevents 
injury 
and 
inflammation 
of 
the 
muscles, 
thereby 
reducing 
postoperative 
pain 
and 
recovery 
time. 


The 
reduction 
in 
delayed 
postoperative 
hemorrhage 
with 
intracapsular 
tonsillectomy 
is 
probably 
a 
result 
of 
preserving 
a 
rim 
of 
tonsil 
tissue 
on 
the 
capsule. 
Because 
the 
tonsil 
is 
removed 
from 
the 
outside 
in, 
the 
resection 
is 
performed 
distal 
to 
the 
arborization 
of 
the 
primary 
tonsillar 
vessels, 
thereby 
exposing 
only 
the 
smaller 
branched 
arterioles, 
which 
seem 
to 
be 
less 
prone 
to 
delayed 
hemorrhage. 
This 
benefit 
presents 
an 
interesting 
conundrum, 
since 
its 
mechanism 
suggests 
that 
the 
decrease 
in 
delayed 
postoperative 
hemorrhage 
should 
be 
inversely 
related 
to 
the 
quantity 
of 
tonsillar 
tissue 
removed. 
As 
more 
tonsil 
is 
resected, 
the 
exposed 
vessels 
become 
proportionally 
larger 
and 
thus 
more 
vulnerable 
to 
delayed 
bleeding. 
However, 
leaving 
more 
tonsil 
tissue 
on 
the 
capsule 
may 
increase 
the 
rate 
of 
tonsillar 
regrowth. 
Tonsillar 
regrowth 
and 
subsequent 
chronic 
tonsillitis 
are 
important 
concerns, 
which 
is 
why 
we 
consider 
chronic 
tonsillitis 
a 
contraindication 
to 
intracapsular 
tonsillectomy. 
Nevertheless, 
today, 
when 
most 
tonsillectomies 
performed 
in 
children 
are 
for 
treatment 
of 
hypertrophy, 
intracapsular 
tonsillectomy 
relieves 
obstructive 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
as 
effectively 
as 
does 
standard 
tonsillectomy 
but 
with 
less 
pain 
and, 
perhaps, 
a 
greater 
margin 
of 
safety. 


The 
tool 
we 
have 
found 
most 
useful 
for 
intracapsular 
tonsillectomy 
is 
the 
endoscopic 
microdebrider. 
Although 
it 
is 
not 
ideal, 
none 
of 
the 
other 
instruments 
or 
techniques 
we 
have 
tried, 
including 
the 
guillotine,10 
electrocautery, 
CO2 
laser,1,3,4 
coblation,11,12 
radiofrequency 
ablation,12,13 
and 
Harmonic 
scalpel,14 
have 
provided 
as 
rapid 
and 
as 


Koltai 
et 
al.: 
Intracapsular 
Partial 
Tonsillectomy 




complete 
yet 
precise 
control 
in 
resecting 
the 
tonsil 
without 
violating 
the 
capsule. 
The 
main 
disadvantage 
of 
the 
microdebrider 
is 
the 
bleeding 
that 
results 
from 
the 
resection, 
which 
can 
obscure 
tissue 
specificity, 
especially 
in 
the 
deeper 
sections 
of 
the 
tonsillar 
excavation, 
thereby 
risking 
injury 
to 
the 
pharyngeal 
musculature. 
This 
can 
be 
prevented 
by 
maintaining 
visualization 
of 
the 
cutting 
tip 
of 
the 
shaver 
blade, 
performing 
a 
layered 
resection, 
and 
intermittently 
using 
suction 
cautery 
to 
control 
excessively 
brisk 
bleeding 
vessels. 


CONCLUSION 


Although 
our 
study 
has 
the 
weaknesses 
associated 
with 
a 
retrospective 
analysis, 
the 
consistency 
with 
which 
we 
have 
achieved 
positive 
results 
with 
intracapsular 
tonsillectomy 
in 
a 
large 
number 
of 
children 
gives 
us 
confidence 
in 
our 
findings. 
We 
are 
currently 
conducting 
a 
prospective, 
randomized 
study 
of 
this 
procedure.
