Objectives: 
To 
determine 
if 
temperature-controlled 
radiofrequency 
(TCRF) 
tonsil 
reduction 
and 
adenoidectomy 
(TCRF&A) 
and 
conventional 
tonsillectomy 
and 
adenoidectomy 
(T&A) 
are 
statistically 
similar 
in 
outcome 
and 
to 
compare 
morbidity 
between 
TCRF&A 
and 
conventional 
T&A. 


Design: 
Randomized 
control 
trial. 


Setting: 
Tertiary 
care 
children’s 
hospital. 


Participants: 
The 
study 
population 
comprised 
23 
patients 
aged 
2.6 
to 
12.5 
years 
with 
symptoms 
of 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea, 
hypertrophic 
tonsils 
with 
no 
other 
areas 
of 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
hypertrophic 
adenoids, 
and 
a 
body 
mass 
index 
(calculated 
as 
weight 
in 
kilograms 
divided 
by 
the 
square 
of 
height 
in 
meters) 
of 
less 
than 
30. 


Intervention: 
Temperature-controlled 
radiofrequency 
tonsil 
reduction 
(mean 
± 
SD, 
12.6±1.5 
ablations 
per 
patient 
and 
994.68±91.88 
J 
per 
insertion) 
and 
adenoidectomy 
or 
traditional 
bovie 
T&A. 


Main 
Outcome 
Measures: 
Primary 
outcomes 
were 
respiratory 
distress 
index 
and 
total 
volume 
reduction. 
Secondary 
outcomes 
include 
postoperative 
pain, 
daytime 


sleepiness, 
speech 
and 
swallowing 
problems, 
weight 
and 
diet, 
narcotic 
use, 
and 
analogue 
snoring 
scale. 


Results: 
The 
respiratory 
distress 
index 
difference 
for 
TCRF&A 
was 
5.63 
vs 
6.56 
for 
standard 
T&A. 
On 
postoperative 
day 
1 
for 
the 
13 
patients 
who 
underwent 
TCRF&A, 
0 
reported 
severe 
pain, 
11 
(85%) 
had 
mild 
to 
moderate 
pain, 
and 
2 
(15%) 
had 
no 
pain. 
In 
the 
10 
patients 
who 
underwent 
standard 
T&A, 
1 
(10%) 
had 
severe 
pain 
and 
9 
(90%) 
had 
mild 
to 
moderate 
pain. 
By 
postoperative 
week 
1, 
all 
TCRF&A 
patients 
experienced 
mild 
or 
no 
pain, 
whereas 
1 
(10%) 
of 
the 
standard 
T&A 
patients 
still 
had 
moderate 
pain. 
Mean 
visual 
analogue 
snore 
scores 
(0-10) 
4 
weeks 
after 
surgery 
were 
less 
than 
1 
for 
both 
groups. 
The 
mean±SD 
weight 
loss 
at 
postoperative 
week 
1 
for 
TCRF 
tonsil 
reduction 
patients 
was 
1.0±3.5 
lb 
(0.45±1.58 
kg) 
vs 
4.6±3.9 
lb 
(2.07±1.76 
kg) 
for 
standard 
T&A 
patients. 
Return 
to 
normal 
diet 
at 
postoperative 
week 
1 
occurred 
in 
11 
TCRF&A 
patients 
(85%) 
and 
0 
standard 
T&A 
patients. 


Conclusions: 
The 
respiratory 
distress 
indexes 
were 
similar 
for 
TCRF&A 
patients 
and 
standard 
T&A 
patients. 
In 
addition, 
there 
were 
similar 
analog 
snoring 
scales, 
decreased 
pain, 
and 
weight 
loss.

BSTRUCTIVE 
SLEEP 
APNEA 
syndrome 
(OSAS) 
or 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
is 
a 
relatively 
common 
problem 
in 
children. 
It 
is 
estimated 
that 
1.6% 
to 
3.4% 
of 
children 
carry 
this 
diagnosis. 
There 
are 
numerous 
physiological 
and 
developmental 
consequences 
of 
undiagnosed 
OSAS. 
Some 
of 
these 
issues 
may 
relate 
to 
the 
variability 
of 
the 
diagnosis 
in 
that 
the 
degree 
of 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
may 
range 
from 
complete 
obstruction 
(obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
[OSA]) 
to 
partial 
obstruction 
(obstruction 
hypopnea) 
of 
the 
airway 
in 
both 
children 
and 
adults.1,2 


The 
most 
common 
cause 
of 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
in 
children 
at 
present 
is 
thought 
to 
be 
due 
to 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy. 
The 
most 
common 
treatment 
for 


this 
is 
surgery, 
and 
the 
most 
common 
surgical 
procedure 
performed 
is 
a 
tonsillectomy 
or 
complete 
removal 
of 
the 
palatine 
tonsils. 
A 
variety 
of 
instruments 
are 
used 
for 
this 
procedure 
including 
knives 
and 
scissors 
(so-called 
cold 
steel), 
an 
electrocautery 
device, 
or 
laser. 
Some 
nonsurgical 
treatment 
options 
are 
also 
available 
and 
include 
nasal 
continuous 
positive 
airway 
pressure, 
weight 
loss, 
and/or 
corticosteroids. 
Because 
of 
poor 
patient 
compliance, 
continuous 
positive 
airway 
pressure 
is 
often 
not 
a 
viable 
treatment 
option. 
Although 
weight 
loss 
is 
often 
recommended, 
it 
is 
rare 
to 
achieve 
a 
large 
enough 
change 
in 
weight 
for 
complete 
resolution 
of 
OSAS 
symptoms. 
Corticosteroids 
also 
have 
a 
demonstrated 
lack 
of 
effectiveness.3

recommends 
tonsillectomy 
for 
tonsillar 
hypertrophy 
causing 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
or 
sleep 
disorders.4 
The 
efficacy 
of 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
the 
treatment 
of 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
has 
been 
well 
documented. 
Snoring, 
episodes 
of 
oxygen 
desaturation, 
and 
periodic 
breathing 
are 
reduced 
or 
eliminated.5-9 
The 
average 
nadir 
arterial 
oxygen 
percentage 
of 
saturation 
increases 
while 
end-
tidal 
carbon 
dioxide 
decreases.6,9-11 
Other 
studies 
have 
shown 
improvements 
in 
obstructive 
respiratory 
events, 
malocclusions, 
behavior, 
and 
learning.5-8,10-14 


However, 
current 
tonsillectomy 
techniques 
are 
not 
free 
of 
disadvantages 
or 
complications. 
Some 
are 
hypernasality, 
hemorrhage, 
pain, 
velopharyngeal 
insufficiency, 
and 
odynophagia 
with 
associated 
dysphagia, 
causing 
dehydration, 
local 
edema, 
and 
comorbid 
conditions 
associated 
with 
the 
need 
for 
narcotic 
analgesics.15-19 
The 
complication 
rates 
range 
from 
less 
than 
1% 
to 
8%.20,21 
Socioeconomic 
implications 
of 
current 
techniques 
include 
an 
average 
of 
7 
to 
10 
days 
lost 
from 
work 
and/or 
school 
and 
potential 
costs 
for 
hospitalization 
because 
of 
dehydration, 
respiratory 
problems, 
or 
bleeding.22,23 


The 
Somnoplasty 
(Gyrus 
ENT, 
LLC, 
Bartlett, 
Tenn) 
temperature-controlled 
radiofrequency 
(TCRF) 
procedure 
has 
been 
used 
successfully 
to 
treat 
obstruction 
at 
the 
level 
of 
the 
soft 
palate, 
turbinates, 
and 
base 
of 
tongue 
in 
adults.24-27 
Radiofrequency 
tissue 
volume 
reduction 
(RFTVR) 
uses 
radiofrequency 
energy 
to 
ablate 
tissue 
in 
a 
minimally 
invasive 
fashion. 
A 
pilot 
study 
by 
Nelson28 
examined 
the 
use 
of 
RFTVR 
for 
tonsil 
reduction 
in 
adults. 
The 
study 
demonstrated 
that 
RFTVR 
was 
successful 
in 
reducing 
the 
tonsil 
size 
by 
70% 
and 
increased 
the 
size 
of 
the 
oropharyngeal 
airway 
by 
12 
mm. 
Daytime 
sleepiness, 
snoring, 
voice 
clarity, 
swallowing, 
and 
throat 
irritation 
were 
also 
substantially 
improved. 
The 
RFTVR 
was 
performed 
and 
well 
tolerated 
in 
an 
in-office 
setting 
using 
local 
anesthesia. 
The 
postoperative 
morbidities 
and 
discomfort 
were 
minimal 
compared 
with 
standard 
tonsillectomy 
procedures 
performed 
using 
general 
anesthesia 
in 
the 
operating 
room. 


With 
the 
Somnoplasty 
TCRF 
procedure, 
the 
target 
temperature 
is 
held 
constant 
(85°C 
for 
tonsil), 
forming 
con


sistent 
lesions 
inside 
the 
tonsil. 
The 
instrument 
possesses 
a 
safety 
shutoff 
in 
the 
event 
that 
the 
target 
temperature 
increases 
to 
more 
than 
105°C 
or 
decreases 
to 
less 
than 
65°C 
on 
the 
surface 
of 
the 
tonsil. 
These 
features 
minimize 
damage 
to 
both 
the 
surrounding 
tissues 
and 
mucosa, 
allowing 
the 
Somnoplasty 
TCRF 
tonsil 
reduction 
to 
be 
accurate, 
minimally 
invasive, 
and 
less 
morbid 
without 
compromising 
treatment 
efficacy 
compared 
with 
complete 
tonsillectomy. 


For 
the 
treatment 
of 
tonsillar 
hypertrophy 
giving 
rise 
to 
upper 
airway 
obstruction, 
TCRF 
reduction 
of 
the 
palatine 
tonsils 
may 
be 
an 
alternative 
surgical 
approach; 
it 
has 
the 
potential 
advantages 
of 
less 
pain 
and 
hemorrhage 
compared 
with 
conventional 
surgery 
because 
injury 
to 
surrounding 
tissues 
are 
avoided 
or 
minimized 
and 
might 
also 
have 
a 
significant 
positive 
impact 
on 
the 
postoperative 
care, 
loss 
of 
work 
or 
school 
time, 
and 
other 
associated 
complications 
that 
result 
from 
complete 
tonsillectomy. 
This 
study 
was 
a 
randomized, 
prospective 
trial 
to 
compare 
TCRF 
tonsil 
reduction 
and 
adenoidectomy 
(TCFR&A) 
to 
complete 
tonsillectomy 
and 
adenoidectomy 
(T&A) 
for 
the 
treatment 
of 
polysomnographicdocumented 
OSAS 
in 
pediatric 
patients. 


METHODS
This

and 
approved 
by 
the

was 
funded 
by 
Somnus

PATIENT 
POPULATION 


Children 
aged 
4 
to 
15 
years 
with 
signs 
and 
symptoms 
of 
OSA 
and 
hypertrophic 
tonsils 
with 
no 
other 
areas 
of 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
hypertrophic 
adenoids 
were 
screened 
with 
a 
detailed 
history 
review 
and 
physical 
examination 
for 
inclusion 
in 
the 
study. 
Inclusion 
criteria 
included 
a 
body 
weight 
of 
less 
than 
150% 
of 
the 
ideal 
weight 
(body 
mass 
index 
[calculated 
as 
weight 
in 
kilograms 
divided 
by 
the 
square 
of 
height 
in 
meters] 
30). 
Persons 
were 
excluded 
if 
they 
had 
a 
history 
of 
surgery 
for 
upper 
airway 
obstruction; 
active 
respiratory 
infection 
or 
chronic 
lung 
disease; 
Down 
syndrome; 
speech, 
swallowing, 
or 
neurological 
disorders; 
craniofacial 
abnormalities; 
and 
other 
comorbid 
conditions 
(such 
as 
cor 
pulmonale). 
A 
total 
of 
27 
patients 
(11 
female 
and 
16 
male) 
were 
selected 
from 
all 
4 
centers 
seeking 
treatment 
for 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
(Table 
1). 
The 
sample 
size 
was 
limited 
because 
this 
investigation 
was 
a 
preliminary 
study. 


Informed 
consent 
and 
assent 
were 
provided 
by 
the 
patient 
and 
parent 
or 
guardian. 
All 
patients 
were 
assessed 
by 
the 
principal 
investigator 
for 
eligibility. 
The 
patients 
then 
underwent 
overnight 
polysomnography. 
All 
sleep 
studies 
were 
performed 
in 
an 
in-patient 
setting 
using 
the 
Alice 
II 
PSG 
system 
(Respironics, 
Pittsburgh, 
Pa). 
The 
protocol 
for 
the 
preoperative 
and 
postoperative 
sleep 
studies 
were 
designed 
by 
a 
board-certified 
pediatric 
sleep 
physician. 
All 
raw 
data 
from 
the 
polysomnography 
were 
evaluated 
by 
the 
same 
sleep 
physician 
who 
was 
blinded 
to 
the 
treatment 
arms 
assigned 
to 
the 
patients. 
We 
believe 
that 
this 
was 
the 
best 
way 
to 
standardize 
collection 
of 
the 
polysomnography 
data.

The 
respiratory 
distress 
index 
(RDI) 
was 
the 
principle 
measure 
evaluated 
by 
the 
polysomnographic 
examinations 
to 
determine 
inclusion 
in 
the 
investigation. 
Only 
patients 
with 
mild 
to 
moderate 
OSA 
were 
included 
in 
the 
study. 
Patients 
with 
severe 
OSA 
(RDI 
30) 
were 
excluded 
owing 
to 
the 
potential 
high 
risk 
associated 
with 
anesthesia. 
Because 
of 
the 
lack 
of 
prior 
evidence 
regarding 
the 
efficacy 
of 
TCRF 
tonsil 
reduction, 
we 
did 
not 
deem 
it 
ethical 
to 
treat 
patients 
with 
severe 
OSA 
(RDI 
30) 
to 
avoid 
placing 
them 
at 
possibly 
higher 
risk. 
Subsequently, 
patients 
with 
mild 
to 
moderate 
OSA 
were 
randomized 
to 
a 
treatment 
number. 
In 
addition, 
patients 
who 
were 
not 
diagnosed 
as 
having 
OSA 
by 
polysomnography 
were 
excluded 
from 
the 
study. 
The 
patients 
were 
assigned 
a 
study 
number 
and 
randomized 
to 
a 
treatment 
protocol 
of 
either 
Somnoplasty 
TCRF&A 
or 
standard 
T&A. 
Both 
the 
patient 
and 
parent/guardian 
were 
notified 
of 
the 
specific 
treatment 
parameter 
(TCRF&A 
or 
standard 
T&A), 
which 
was 
randomized 
to 
them 
1 
week 
prior 
to 
the 
surgery 
date. 
Of 
the 
27 
patients 
enrolled, 
23 
underwent 
surgery 
(13 
underwent 
Somnoplasty 
TCRF&A 
and 
10 
underwent 
standard 
T&A) 
(Table 
1). 
All 
23 
patients 
received 
the 
allotted 
treatment 
protocol 
initially 
assigned 
to 
them, 
and 
thus 
no 
crossover 
occurred. 
Four 
patients 
were 
not 
treated, 
as 
they 
did 
not 
return 
and 
were 
excluded 
from 
the 
study 
because 
no 
further 
information 
could 
be 
obtained 
regarding 
their 
whereabouts. 
In 
all 
patients, 
the 
adenoids 
were 
removed 
if 
determined 
to 
be 
hypertrophic 
by 
the 
surgeon 
using 
standard 
surgical 
procedures 
such 
as 
curette, 
Thompson–St 
Clair 
forceps, 
or 
suction 
cautery 
unless 
contraindicated. 


The 
tonsils 
were 
graded 
according 
to 
a

A

were 
completed. 
Prior 
to 
either 
procedure, 
all 
patients 
received 
a 
3-day 
course 
of 
amoxicillin 
(40 
mg/kg 
3 
times

orally. 
In 
those

of 
an 
allergy 
to 
penicillin, 
clindamycin 
(25 
mg/kg 
4

All 
procedures 
were 
performed

TCRF 
TONSIL 
REDUCTION 
AND 
ADENOIDECTOMY 


The 
tonsillar 
pillars 
on 
each 
side 
were 
infiltrated 
with 
5.0 
mL 
of 
0.25% 
bupivacaine 
hydrochloride 
without 
epinephrine. 
The 
tonsil 
parenchyma 
was 
infiltrated 
with 
5.0 
mL 
of 
isotonic 
sodium 
chloride 
solution 
on 
each 
side 
(Figure 
1). 
The 
TCRF 
reduction 
of 
the 
palatine 
tonsils 
was 
performed 
using 
a 
hand-
piece 
with 
2 
electrodes. 
Depending 
on 
the 
size 
of 
the 
tonsil, 
5 
to 
7 
insertions 
were 
made 
in 
each 
tonsil 
(Figure 
2). 
This 
resulted 
in 
a 
mean±SD 
of 
12.6±1.50 
ablations 
per 
patient 
and 
994.68±91.88 
J 
per 
insertion. 
Dexamethasone 
sodium 
phosphate 
(Decadron; 
Merck 
& 
Co 
Inc, 
Whitehouse 
Station, 
NJ) 
was 
given 
intravenously 
(0.5 
mg/kg, 
up 
to 
a 
maximum 
dose 
of 
20 
mg) 
at 
0, 
6, 
and 
12 
hours 
postoperatively. 
All 
patients 
were 
admitted 
to 
the 
hospital 
for 
24 
hours 
of 
observation. 
Most 
were 
admitted 
to 
the 
intensive 
care 
unit 
as 
a 
safety 
precaution 
following 
the 
procedure 
owing 
to 
the 
anticipated 
tonsillar 
edema 
postoperatively. 
As 
experience 
was 
gained 
with 
this 
procedure 
and 
when 
the 
patients 
were 
older 
(age 
6 
years), 
some 
patients 
were 
admitted 
to 
a

using 
a 
monopolar 
electrocautery

Decadron 
was 
given 
intravenously 


(0.5 
mg/kg 
up 
to 
a 
maximum 
dose 
of 
20 
mg) 
at 
time 
0, 
6, 
and 
12 
hours 
postoperatively. 
All 
patients 
were 
admitted 
and 
observed 
overnight 
in 
a 
regular 
hospital 
bed. 
Hemostasis 
was 
obtained 
in 
both 
the 
nasopharynx 
and 
tonsillar 
fossae 
using 
a 
combination 
of 
packing 
and 
suction 
cautery. 
At 
discharge 
from 
the 
hospital, 
all 
patients 
received 
a 
7-day 
course 
of 
either 
amoxicillin 
or 
clindamycin 
orally 
at 
the 
same 
dose 
as 
before

PAIN 
ON

A 
subjective 
pain 
assessment 
visual 
analogue 
scale 
was 
used 
to 
record 
pain 
level 
(no 
pain, 
mild 
pain, 
moderate 
pain, 
and 
severe 
pain) 
among 
the 
Somnoplasty 
TCRF&A 
and 
T&A 
patients. 
Degrees 
of 
pain 
were 
defined 
as 
mild 
(an 
awareness 
of 
signs 
or 
symptoms 
but 
easily 
tolerated, 
causing 
no 
loss 
of 
time 
from 
normal 
activities 
or 
requiring 
medication); 
moderate 
(discomfort 
severe 
enough 
to 
cause 
interference 
with 
usual 
activities); 
and 
severe 
(incapacitating 
pain 
with 
inability 
to 
do 
work 
or 
usual 
activities 
or 
signs 
and 
symptoms 
that 
may 
be 
of 
systemic 
nature 
or 
requiring 
medical 
evaluation 
or 
treatment). 


On 
postoperative 
day 
1, 
decreased 
pain 
was 
observed 
among 
the 
TCRF&A 
patients 
(Figure

compared 
with 
the 
T&A 
patients. 
Within 
the 
TCRF&A 
subgroup, 
severe

was 
not 
reported. 
Of 
the 
13 
TCRF&A 
patients, 
10 
(77%) 
had 
mild 
pain, 
2 
(15%) 
had

patients, 
1 
(10%) 
reported 
severe

COMMENT
The 
postoperative 
course 
following 
tonsillectomy 
may 
include 
considerable 
pain, 
weight 
loss, 
dehydration 
due 
to 
difficulty 
in 
swallowing, 
and 
in 
some 
cases, 
hospitalization 
due 
to 
respiratory 
problems 
or 
bleeding. 
Tonsillectomy 
by 
laser 
or 
electrocautery 
has 
not 
been 
shown 
to 
decrease 
postoperative 
pain 
or 
hemorrhage 
rates.17,18 
In 
fact, 
laser 
surgery 
of 
mucosal 
tissue 
has 
been 
demonstrated 
to 
cause 
pathologic 
changes 
beyond 
the 
point 
of 
application, 
which 
may 
contribute 
to 
the 
pharyngeal 
dryness 
and 
sleep 
apnea 
shown 
after 
treatment 
in 
some 
patients.

It 
seems 
reasonable 
to 
conclude 
that 
preserving 
the 
overlying 
mucosa 
may 
be 
an 
important 
factor 
in 
controlling 
the 
complications 
often 
associated 
with 
traditional 
tonsillectomies. 
In 
fact, 
an 
animal 
study 
using 
mucosal 
intact 
laser 
tonsillar 
ablation, 
which 
preserves 
the 
overlying 
mucosa, 
was 
shown 
to 
exhibit 
significant 
benefits 
in 
parameters 
such 
as 
onset 
of 
eating 
solid 
food, 
amount 
of 
food 
ingested 
per 
day, 
onset 
of 
normal 
activity, 
and 
degree 
of 
weight 
loss.29 
In 
addition, 
a 
recent 
case 
report 
cited 
preservation 
of 
normal 
histologic 
architecture 
in 
the 
tonsils 
after 
radiofrequency 
treatment.30 
Over 
the 
last 
10 
years, 
other 
tonsil 
surgeons 
have 
recognized 
the 
advantages 
of 
avoiding 
or 
minimizing 
injury 
to 
the 
tissues 
surrounding 
the 
tonsillar 
fossa 
and 
have 
described 
procedures 
to 
remove 
a 
portion 
of 
the 
tonsil 
to 
avoid 
or 
lessen 
the 
problems 
associated 
with 
complete 
tonsillectomy. 
Some 
include 
a

ablation 
or 
coblation, 
and 
the 
use 
of 
a 
microdebrider.31-34 


Temperature-controlled 
radiofrequency 
tonsil 
reduction 
provides 
a 
minimally 
invasive 
alternative 
method 
for 
the 
surgical 
treatment 
of 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
due 
to 
tonsillar 
hypertrophy 
compared 
with 
complete 
tonsillectomy 
by 
electrocautery. 
Statistically 
similar 
results 
in 
pretreatment 
and 
posttreatment 
RDI 
were 
seen 
in 
both 
the 
TCRF&A 
and 
T&A 
groups, 
in 
which 
most 
of 
these 
patients 
were 
diagnosed 
by 
RDI 
with 
mild 
OSA. 
Following 
TCRF&A 
or 
T&A, 
these 
patients 
demonstrated 
comparable 
changes 
in 
RDI 
of 
5.63 
(TCRF&A) 
and 
6.45 
(T&A). 
Using 
an 
RDI 
of 
5 
as 
a 
cutoff 
for 
pediatric 
OSA, 
most 
of 
the 
patients 
in 
both 
arms 
of 
the 
study 
did 
not 
appear 
to 
have 
OSA 
at 
3 
months 
after 
treatment 
(TCRF&A 
median 
RDI, 
0.30; 
T&A 
median 
RDI, 
1.55). 
Because 
all 
polysomnographic 
examinations 
were 
performed 
by 
1 
pediatric 
pulmonologist 
blinded 
to 
the 
study, 
we 
are 
confident 
in 
the 
conclusion 
that 
these 
treatment 
modalities 
demonstrated 
no 
statistical 
difference. 
Therefore, 
from 
our 
data 
we 
conclude 
that 
TCRF&A 
elicits 
no 
significant 
difference 
in 
treatment 
outcomes 
compared 
with 
standard 
T&A 
for 
mild 
to 
moderate 
OSA. 


In 
addition, 
several 
morbidity 
factors 
were 
compared 
between 
the 
2 
treatment 
modalities. 
Temperature-
controlled 
radiofrequency 
tonsil 
reduction 
ablates 
tissue 
inside 
the 
tonsil 
and 
optimizes 
volume 
reduction 
with 
the 
help 
of 
isotonic 
sodium 
chloride 
solution 
injected 
into 
the 
tonsil 
prior 
to 
inserting 
the 
probe. 
This 
technique 
re


sults 
in 
a 
gradual 
reduction 
of 
the 
tonsil 
size, 
while 
leaving 
the 
tonsil’s 
surface 
and 
surrounding 
tissues 
with 
minimal 
or 
no 
injury. 
Compared 
with 
the 
standard 
T&A 
method, 
the 
benefits 
observed 
of 
TCRF&A 
include 
preservation 
of 
overlying 
mucosa, 
decreased 
pain 
from 
the 
first 
postoperative 
day, 
decreased 
dependence 
on 
analgesics, 
decreased 
weight 
loss, 
more 
rapid 
return 
to 
normal 
diet, 
and 
comparable 
differences 
in 
obstructive 
symptoms 
such 
as 
snoring, 
daytime 
sleepiness, 
speech 
difficulties, 
and 
swallowing 
difficulties. 
One 
might 
also 
anticipate 
a 
decrease 
in 
emotional 
distress 
compared 
with 
the 
complete 
tonsillectomy 
procedure. 
In 
fact, 
of 
the 
13 
TCRF&A 
patients, 
12 
(95%) 
had 
no 
pain 
by 
day 
7, 
11 
(85%) 
returned 
to 
a 
normal 
diet 
by 
day 
7, 
and 
0 
were 
using 
analgesics 
by 
1 
week 
after 
treatment. 


Clinically, 
no 
demonstrable 
difference 
in 
treatment 
outcomes 
appears 
between 
Somnoplasty 
TCRF&A 
and 
standard 
T&A. 
The 
possible 
clinical 
advantage 
to 
this 
approach 
over 
tonsillectomy 
may 
be 
the 
reduced 
postoperative 
morbidities 
and 
decreased 
level 
of 
patient 
discomfort. 
Our 
data 
compare 
favorably 
to 
a 
recent 
non-
randomized 
case 
series 
using 
TCRF 
tonsil 
reduction 
in 
children 
by 
Nelson.35 
In 
our 
investigation, 
substantial 
improvement 
was 
seen 
in 
symptoms 
such 
as 
daytime 
sleepiness, 
snoring, 
and 
speech 
and 
swallowing 
difficulties 
as 
well 
as 
a 
more 
rapid 
return 
of 
normal 
diet 
than 
that 
seen 
with 
traditional 
tonsillectomy 
procedures. 
However, 
variability 
was 
observed 
in 
the 
amount 
of 
tonsil 
tissue 
remaining 
6 
weeks 
after 
treatment 
when 
comparing 
one 
patient 
with 
another. 
In 
addition, 
the 
cost 
of 
TCRF 
instrumentation 
is 
higher 
compared 
with 
cold-steel 
and 
electrocautery 
devices 
that 
are 
currently 
in 
use. 
Indeed, 
future 
studies 
will 
be 
directed 
at 
investigating 
the 
variability 
of 
tonsil 
tissue 
remaining 
posttreatment. 
In 
addition, 
larger 
sample 
sizes 
will 
be 
required 
to 
assess 
whether 
these 
2 
procedures 
have 
equal 
efficacies. 
Although 
this 
investigation 
was 
a 
preliminary 
study, 
valuable 
data 
regarding 
treatment 
outcomes 
were 
obtained 
and 
suggest 
that 
additional 
studies 
may 
help 
promote 
further 
development 
and 
use 
of 
TCRF 
tonsil 
reduction.
