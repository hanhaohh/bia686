OBJECTIVE: 
To study the outcome of adenotonsillectomy 
for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in children 
less than 3 years of age. 
DESIGN 
AND 
SETTING: 
Prospective study at the University 
of New Mexico Children’s Hospital. Children 
with OSA underwent pre-and postoperative full-
night polysomnography (PSG). Scores were compared 
using a paired t 
test. A P-value <0.05 was 
considered significant. 
RESULTS: 
The study population included 20 children. 
Fifteen (75 %) were male. The mean age was 2.2 
years (range, 1.1 to 3.0). Sixteen (80%) children had 
medical comorbidities. Over 25% of children had 
postoperative complications including laryngospasm 
and marked desaturations. The mean preoperative 
respiratory distress index (RDI) was 34.1 
and the mean postoperative RDI was 12.2 (P 
< 
0.0001). After surgery, 7 (35%) children had an RDI < 


5. Thirteen (65%) had a postoperative RDI > 
5 indicating 
persistent OSA. 
CONCLUSION 
AND 
SIGNIFICANCE: 
Children under 3 
years show significant improvement in RDI after adenotonsillectomy 
for OSA, but they may develop 
complications after surgery. Postoperative PSG is recommended 
for children under 3 years of age to monitor 
the severity of persistent OSA. EBM rating: B-2.

Obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
(OSA) 
has 
become 
the 
most 
common 
indication 
for 
adenotonsillectomy 
in 
the 
pediatric 
population.1,2 Over the last 10 years, there has 
been 
increasing 
awareness 
that 
OSA 
in 
children 
may 
cause 
developmental 
delay, 
failure 
to 
thrive, 
cardiorespiratory 
complications, and behavioral disorders.3-6 
These problems improve after adenotonsillectomy.7,8

undergo 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA 
has 
increased 
whereas 
the 
percentage 
who 
undergo 
this 
procedure 
for 
relief of recurrent tonsillitis has decreased.1 In a recent 
study9 of young children who underwent adenotonsillectomy, 
91% 
had 
the 
procedure 
for 
OSA 
and 
only 
9% 
for 
recurrent 
throat 
infections. 


Children 
under 
3 
years 
of 
age 
are 
considered 
to 
be 
at 
high-risk 
for 
the 
development 
of 
complications 
after 
adenotonsillectomy.10 These complications include respiratory 
compromise 
caused 
by 
edema 
in 
the 
relatively 
narrow 
oropharynx 
of 
a 
young 
child, 
circulatory 
collapse 
as 
a 
consequence 
of 
blood 
loss 
in 
a 
child 
with 
low 
blood 
volume 
reserves, 
and 
high 
rates 
of 
dehydration 
because of poor oral intake.5,11,12 In view of these risks, 
it 
has 
been 
recommended 
that 
young 
children 
undergoing 
adenotonsillectomy 
stay 
in 
hospital 
overnight 
for 
observation.7,10 


Previous 
reports 
on 
adenotonsillectomy 
in 
young 
children 
have 
evaluated 
outcome 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
postoperative 
complications.2,9,11-15 The emphasis placed 
on 
complications 
reflects 
the 
risks 
of 
surgery 
in 
these 
children. 
However, 
it 
is 
also 
important 
to 
establish 
the 
degree 
of 
improvement 
in 
OSA 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
in 
young 
children 
with 
the 
use 
of 
full-night 
polysomnography 
(PSG),16 the acknowledged standard for 
diagnosis 
of 
sleep 
disorders. 
To 
date, 
the 
high 
cost 
of 
PSG, 
limited 
availability 
of 
the 
procedure, 
and 
difficulties 
in 
obtaining 
PSG 
before 
and 
after 
surgery 
have 
prohibited 
this 
type 
of 
study. 
The 
present 
article 
examines 
changes 
in 
the 
respiratory 
distress 
index 
(RDI) 
as 
measured by PSG 16 after adenotonsillectomy for OSA 
in 
children 
under 
3 
years 
of 
age. 
The 
purpose 
is 
to 
evaluate 
changes 
in 
the 
physiology 
of 
sleep 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA 
in 
the 
high-risk 
population 
of 
children 
under 
3 
years 
of 
age. 


METHODS 


Approval 
for 
this 
study 
was 
obtained 
from 
the 
institutional 
review 
board 
of 
the 
University 
of 
New 
Mexico 
School 
of 
Medicine, 
Albuquerque. 
Children 
who 
were 
shown 
to 
have 
OSA 
by 
polysomnography 
and 
were 
under 
3 
years 
of 
age 
were 
included 
in 
the 
study. 
The 
caregivers 
of 
these 
children 
were 
asked 
to 
complete 
an 
informed 
consent 
document 
before 
enrolling 
the 
child 
in 
the 
study. 
Exclusion 
criteria 
included: 
(1) 
children 
. 
36 
months 
of 
age; 
(2) 
children 
who 
had 
a 
previous 
adenotonsillectomy; 
and

children 
with 
an 
RDI

For 
each 
child, 
the 
following 
was 
recorded: 
age, 
gender, 
ethnicity, 
associated 
comorbidities, 
and 
pre-
and 
postoperative 
body 
mass 
index 
(BMI). 
Age-and 
gender-specific 
BMI 
percentiles 
were 
calculated, 
and 
children 
were 
divided 
into 
4 
groups 
according 
to 
published 
guidelines.17 Group 1 included children who 
were 
underweight 
with 
a 
BMI 
less 
than 
or 
equal 
to 
the 
5th 
percentile; 
group 
2 
included 
children 
who 
were 
of 
normal 
weight 
with 
a 
BMI 
greater 
than 
the 
5th 
percentile 
but 
less 
than 
the 
85th 
percentile; 
group 
3 
included 
children 
who 
were 
at 
risk 
of 
being 
overweight 
with 
a 
BMI 
greater 
than 
or 
equal 
to 
the 
85th 
percentile 
but 
less 
than 
the 
95th 
percentile; 
and 
group 
4 
included 
children 
who 
were 
overweight 
with 
a 
BMI 
greater 
than 
or 
equal 
to 
the 
95th 
percentile. 


Children 
underwent 
a 
monopolar 
Bovie 
adenotonsillectomy 
and 
were 
admitted 
to 
hospital 
after 
surgery. 
For 
each 
child 
the 
following 
was 
recorded: 
complications 
during 
extubation 
or 
in 
the 
recovery 
room; 
complications 
during 
hospital 
stay; 
need 
for 
intensive 
care 
monitoring; 
and 
total 
length 
of 
hospital 
stay. 


The 
effectiveness 
of 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA 
was evaluated using PSG.16 A certified sleep medicine 
physician 
interpreted 
the 
results 
of 
all 
PSGs. 
The 
RDI, 
defined 
as 
the 
average 
number 
of 
apneas 
and 
hypopneas 
per hour of sleep,18 was used for diagnosis of OSA. 
Children 
enrolled 
in 
the 
study 
also 
underwent 
a 
second 
PSG 
within 
12 
months 
after 
surgery 
and 
findings 
were 
classified 
as: 
mild 
(RDI 
. 
5 
10); 
moderate 
(RDI 
. 
10 
20); 
or 
severe 
(RDI 
. 
20). 
The 
minimum 
oxygen 
saturation 
was 
also 
recorded. 


A 
power 
analysis 
indicated 
that 
a 
sample 
size 
of 
20 
is 
adequate 
to 
detect 
a 
difference 
of 
15 
in 
RDI 
with 
80% 
power 
and 
.05. 
A 
change 
in 
RDI 
from 
25 
to 
10 indicates a change from severe to moderate OSA.10 
Therefore, 
the 
present 
study 
has 
sufficient 
power 
to 
detect 
a 
clinically 
significant 
change 
in 
the 
physiological 
parameters 
of 
sleep 
as 
measured 
by 
RDI. 
A 
paired 
t 
test 
was 
used 
to 
evaluate 
the 
differences 
in 
pre-and 
postoperative 
RDI. 
A 
P 
value 
0.05 
was 
considered 
significant. 


RESULTS 


Twenty-six 
children 
were 
included 
in 
the 
study. 
Three 
of 
these 
children 
were 
lost 
to 
follow-up 
and 
3 
did 
not 
have 
postoperative 
PSG. 
As 
a 
consequence, 
the 
study 
population 
included 
20 
children 
of 
whom 
15 
(75 
%) 
were 
male. 
The 
mean 
age 
of 
the 
children 
at 
the 
time 
of 
inclusion 
was 
2.2 
years 
(range, 
1.1 
to 
3.0 
years). 
Ten 
children 
were 
Hispanic 
or 
Latino, 
5 
children 
were 
non-
Hispanic 
or 
Latino 
white, 
1 
was 
Native 
American, 
and 
in 
4 
children 
the 
ethnicity 
was 
described 
as 
“other.” 


Sixteen 
(80%) 
children 
had 
associated

On 
the 
basis 
of 
preoperative 
BMI 
percentiles, 
5 
children 
were 
in 
group 
1 
(underweight), 
7 
were 
in 
group

2 
were 
in 
group 
3 
(at 
risk 
of 
being

and 
6 
were 
in 
group

(overweight). 
Postoperatively, 
2 
children 
were 
in 
group 
1, 
9 
were 
in 
group 
2, 
1 
was 
in 
group 
3, 
and 
8 
were 
in 
group 
4. 
The 
mean 
preoperative 
BMI 
was 
18.2 
and 
the 
mean 
postoperative 
BMI 
was 
18.5. 
Postoperative 
BMI 
values 
were 
not 
significantly 
different 
from 
preoperative 
values 
(P 
0.85). 


The 
mean 
hospital 
stay 
following 
surgery 
was 
2.4 
days 
(range, 
1.0 
to 
6.0 
days). 
Six 
(30%) 
children 
stayed 
in 
hospital 
for 
4 
or 
more 
days. 
Three 
(15%) 
children 
required 
an 
overnight 
stay 
in 
the 
intensive 
care 
unit 
(ICU). 
The 
most 
common 
reason 
for 
prolonged 
hospitalization 
was 
poor 
oral 
intake 
in 
6 
(30%) 
children. 
Two 
(10%) 
children 
had 
laryngeal 
spasm 
after 
extubation 
and 
1 
of 
these 
children 
required 
reintubation. 
Five 
(25%) 
children 
required 
supplemental 
oxygen 
because 
of 
significant 
desaturations 
after 
surgery. 


Mean 
values 
for 
pre-and 
postoperative 
RDIs 
are 
presented in Table 1 along with minimum and maximum 
values 
and 
95% 
confidence 
intervals. 
The 
mean 
interval 
between 
the 
first 
and 
second 
PSG 
was 
9.3 
months 
(range, 
4.3 
to 
20.6 
months). 
The 
mean 
interval 
between 
adenotonsillectomy 
and 
the 
second 
PSG 
was 


7.2 
months 
(range, 
4.1 
to 
20.4 
months). 
The 
mean 
preoperative 
RDI 
was 
34.1 
and 
the 
mean 
postoperative 
RDI 
was 
12.2. 
The 
difference 
in 
pre-and 
postoperative 
RDI 
values 
is 
significant 
(P 
. 
0.0001). 
Results 
for 
children 
grouped 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
RDI 
values 
are 
shown 
in Table 2. Seven (35%) children had an RDI less than 
5 
after 
surgery 
indicating 
no 
evidence 
of 
OSA. 
Thirteen 
children 
had 
an 
RDI 
greater 
than 
or 
equal 
to 
5 
after 
surgery 
indicating 
persistent 
OSA. 
Three 
children 
had 
an 
RDI 
greater 
than 
or 
equal 
to 
20 
indicating 
severe 
persistent 
OSA. 
In 
addition, 
12 
children 
had 
a 
minimum 
O2 
saturation 
below 
80% 
before 
surgery 
and 
8 
children 
had 
minimum 
O2 
saturation 
below 
80% 
after 
surgery.

A 
further 
analysis 
of 
these 
results 
was 
done 
comparing 
children 
with 
Down

craniofacial 
abnormalities 
(group 
A, 
7 
children) 
with 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
group 
(group

13 
children). 
In 
group 
A, 
the 
mean 
hospital 
stay 
after 
surgery 
was 
3.9 
days 
(range, 
1.0 
to 
6.0

The 
most 
common 
reason 
for 
prolonged 
hospitalization 
was 
significant 
desaturations 
after 
surgery 
in 
3 
children. 
Four 
children 
stayed 
in 
hospital 
for 
6 
days. 
Two 
children 
required 
an

The 
mean 
pre-

RDIs 
were 
41.5 
and 
24.2, 
respectively. 
In 
group 
B, 
the 
mean 
hospital 
stay 
after 
surgery 
was 
1.6 
days 
(range, 
1.0 
to

The 
most 
common 
reason 
for 
prolonged

was 
poor 
oral 
intake. 
Two 
children 
had

and 
1 
of 
these

The 
mean 
pre-and 
postoperative 
RDIs 
were 
30.1 
and 
5.8, 
respectively. 


DISCUSSION 


The present study confirms previous reports3,11 that 
children 
under 
3 
years 
of 
age 
represent 
a 
high-risk 
group 
for 
complications 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA. 
These 
complications 
include 
laryngospasm, 
severe 
desaturations 
requiring 
supplemental 
oxygen, 
and 
poor 
oral 
intake. 
Over 
25% 
of 
the 
children 
included 
in 
the 
study 
were 
affected 
by 
these 
complications. 
The 
average 
length 
of 
hospitalization 
was 
2.4 
days 
but 
about 
30% 
of 
children 
stayed 
for 
4 
days 
or 
longer, 
and 
some 
stayed 
as 
long 
as 
6 
days. 
Three 
(15%) 
children 
required 
monitoring 
in 
the 
ICU. 


Mitchell et al13 reported on children younger than 3 
years 
who 
underwent 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
recurrent 
infections. 
They 
concluded 
that 
the 
rate 
of 
complications 
was 
not 
greater 
in 
these 
children 
than 
in 
children 
older 
than 
3 
years 
who 
underwent 
the 
same 
procedure. 
However, 
children 
with 
OSA 
were 
excluded 
from 
this 
study. 
Postoperative 
complications 
in 
children 
with 
OSA have been shown to be much more common.2,9 
Tom et al2 and Ross et al9 recommended overnight 
observation 
in 
hospital 
for 
these 
children. 
The 
results 
of 
the 
present 
study 
support 
this 
recommendation. 


Previous 
studies 
have 
also 
reported 
a 
high 
prevalence 
of 
medical 
comorbidities 
in 
children 
under 
3 
years of age with OSA. Ross et al9 reported retrospec-

3 
years 
who 
underwent 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA. 
Eighty-nine 
(21%) 
of 
these 
children 
had 
comorbidities. 
The 
most 
common 
were 
asthma, 
Down 
syndrome, 
and 
chronic 
lung 
disease. 
They 
showed 
that 
children 
with 
Down 
syndrome 
and 
chronic 
lung 
disease 
were 
more 
frequently 
admitted 
to 
the 
ICU, 
more 
frequently 
required 
supplemental 
oxygen, and required longer hospitalization. Tom et al2 
showed 
that 
comorbidities 
were 
associated 
with 
a 
higher 
incidence 
of 
postoperative 
airway 
complications 
in 
children 
under 
3 
years 
who 
underwent 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA. 
These 
comorbidities 
were 
also 
associated 
with 
an 
increased 
likelihood 
that 
children 
would 
require monitoring in an ICU.2 An important unanswered 
question 
about 
these 
patients 
is 
the 
need 
for 
postoperative 
ICU 
monitoring. 
None 
of 
the 
children 
in 
this 
study 
were 
scheduled 
for 
routine 
ICU 
monitoring 
though 
3 
children 
required 
it. 
Two 
of 
these 
children 
had 
Down 
syndrome, 
but 
1 
child 
had 
no 
comorbidities. 
The 
small 
sample 
size 
in 
this 
study 
precludes 
a 
discussion 
of 
criteria 
or 
benefits 
of 
routine 
ICU 
monitoring 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA 
in 
children 
under 
3. 


In 
the 
present 
study 
of 
20 
children 
under 
3 
years 
with 
OSA, 
the 
mean 
preoperative 
RDI 
was 
34.1 
and 
the 
mean 
postoperative 
RDI 
was 
12.2. 
Only 
7 
(35%) 
children 
had 
resolution 
of 
OSA 
as 
measured 
by 
a 
postoperative 
RDI 
of 
less 
than 
5. 
Before 
surgery, 
12 
(60%) 
children 
had 
an 
RDI 
equal 
to 
or 
greater 
than 
20. 
This 
value 
indicates 
severe 
OSA. 
After 
surgery, 
only 
3 
(15%) 
children 
had 
an 
RDI 
equal 
to 
or 
greater 
than 
20. 
Therefore, 
the 
number 
of 
children 
with 
severe 
OSA 
after 
surgery 
decreased 
significantly. 
However, 
only 
7 
(35 
%) 
children 
had 
resolution 
of 
OSA 
as 
measured 
by 
a 
postoperative 
RDI 
of 
less 
than 
5. 
Three 
children 
had 
persistent 
severe 
OSA 
after 
surgery, 
and 
5 
others 
had 
minimum 
oxygen 
desaturations 
below 
80%. 
These 
findings 
imply 
that 
children 
under 
3 
years 
with 
OSA 
should 
have 
routine 
postoperative 
PSG 
to 
identify 
persistent 
OSA 
and 
significant 
desaturations 
especially 
if 
they 
have 
significant 
comorbidities. 


To 
our 
knowledge 
this 
is 
the 
first 
reported 
study 
that 
includes 
data 
on 
pre-and 
postoperative 
PSG 
for 
children 
under 
3 
years 
undergoing 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA. 
However, 
our 
conclusions 
are 
limited 
by 
difficulties 
related 
to 
the 
sample 
size. 
There 
was 
not 
sufficient 
power 
to 
associate 
specific 
comorbidities 
such 
as 
Down 
syndrome 
or 
GERD 
with 
the 
complication 
rate 
or 
with 
the 
extent 
of 
improvement 
after 
surgery 
as 
documented 
by 
PSG. 
Also, 
we 
do 
not 
report 
data 
about 
whether 
improvements 
in 
OSA 
as 
measured 
by 
RDI 
are 
maintained 
long-term. 
In 
spite 
of 
these 
limitations, 
the 
present 
study 
shows 
that 
children 
do 
improve 
markedly 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
severe 
OSA, 
but 
the 
majority 
have 
persistent 
symptoms 
of 
the 
disorder.

CONCLUSION 


Children 
under 
3 
years 
of 
age 
with 
OSA 
usually 
have 
a 
number 
of 
associated 
comorbidities. 
They 
are 
at 
high-risk 
for 
complications 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
and 
should 
be 
observed 
overnight 
in 
hospital 
after 
surgery. 
These 
children 
show 
significant 
improvement 
in 
RDI 
over 
a 
period 
of 
several 
months 
after 
adenotonsillectomy. 
However, 
PSG 
is 
recommended 
for 
children 
under 
3 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA 
because 
the 
majority 
of 
them 
have 
postoperative 
RDIs 
that 
indicate 
persistent 
OSA.
