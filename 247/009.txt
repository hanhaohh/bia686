Summary 


Objective: 
The incidence of snoring in the pediatric population is 10% and the 
incidence of OSAS is equal to 2—3%. Sometimes, primary snoring and OSAS overlap 
and only polysomnography can differentiate the two disorders but its use is complex, 
expensive and highly controversial. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the 
value of the clinical assessment associated with the patient’s history in selecting 
children with OSAS and to validate the therapeutic algorithm, thereby employing 
polysomnography only for selected cases. 
Methods: 
A population of 118 patients was considered, selected by means of a 
questionnaire that indicated OSAS and a clinical evaluation that confirmed the 
diagnosis. The studied group underwent clinical assessment complete with fibreoptic 
survey as well as nocturnal pulse oxymetry, orthodontic and phoniatric evaluation. 
Regardless of the adenotonsillar size, all the selected children underwent adenotonsillectomy 
and were evaluated after 3 months with the help of a questionnaire, 
ORL examination and nocturnal pulse oxymetry. 
Results: 
In all the patients we witnessed the disappearance of apnea. A 80.5% of 
children benefited from the surgical procedure.A 12.7% continued to present minor 
symptoms.A6.8% continuedto snoreina discontinuous manner,but without apnea: 
these children were re-assessed after a further 6 months with nocturnal pulse 
oxymetry and no oxymetric alteration was demonstrated. There were no significant 
differences between the degree of upper airway obstruction and the surgical outcome.

Conclusion: 
The history and clinical exam are sensitive tools, even though relatively 
aspecific. Our results confirm the validity of the history and clinical exam as a 
screening method as well as the role of the surgical procedure that can re-establish 
the patency of the upper airways and to contrast the neuromuscular hypotonia as a 
resultof the effectof the surgical scar.Ifitis true that primary snoring and OSAS area 
continuum, our approach regarding surgery may be defined as a form of prevention 
regarding a pathology with potential complications. Polysomnography cannot be 
carried out routinely due to the lack of specialised centres and because of its 
excessive cost. It is an option to be used only in unsuccessful adenotonsillectomies 
and for those children who have complicated presentations from the outset.

1. 
Introduction 
In children, the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome 
(OSAS) is an alteration of the breathing pattern 
during sleep, characterised by the partial or complete 
obstruction of the upper airways, that interrupts 
normal nocturnal ventilation and the normal 
architectureof sleep [1].Primarysnoring (PS), however, 
is featured by snoring without obstructive 
apnea, frequent awakenings during sleep and abnormal 
pulmonary gaseous exchange [2]. 

The symptoms correlated with OSAS present various 
degrees of severity, bothduring the day and at 
night. Diurnal symptoms include the alteration of 
normal behaviour such as more pronounced irritability, 
attention deficit and poorer performance at 
school; excessive daytime sleepiness or morning 
headache are also possible, even though not as 
common. Conversely, chronic diurnal nasalobstruction, 
rhinorrhea or hyponasal speech are commonly 
present. 

The nocturnal symptoms are snoring, agitated 
and discontinuous sleep, apnea, decubitus with 
hyperextended head, nightmares, diaphoresis, 
enuresis. In the most severe cases, cardiac and 
pulmonary complications may be present as well 
as neurological disorders and poor growth. Approximately 
10% of children under 6 years of age are 
common snorers but do not present OSAS, nor are 
they predisposed to it [3]. The incidence of OSASin 
the pediatric population is 2—3% [4,5]. 

The natural history of OSAS has not yet been 
clearly defined even though it is now an accepted 
tenet of clinical practice that simple snoring is one 
of the risk factors that indicates the possibility of 
developing the disease. 

The criteria for diagnosis and treatment differ 
from those of the adult population and, even though 
there have been attempts to standardise them, 
these are not universally accepted [6]. 

The most frequent cause of OSAS in children is 
adenotonsillar hypertrophy [7—9]. Other causes are 
nasal obstruction (caused by allergic rhinitis, sinusitis,
cysticfibrosis, laryngeal masses,laryngomalacia, 

tracheomalacia), cleft palate, malformations associated 
to cranialand facial alterations, neurological 
or neuromuscular disorders. 

Numerous studies have already reported an 
improvement in snoring and in OSAS following adenotonsillectomy. 
The first therapeutic step in cases 
of unresponsive OSAS in children usually is adenotonsillectomy, 
even in the presence of rather small 
adenotonsillar sizes, especially in uncomplicated 
children, i.e. children older than 2 years of age, 
without pulmonary, neuromuscular, genetic or 
metabolic diseases or Down’s syndrome [10,11]. 

The presenting symptoms of PS and OSAS often 
overlap, and onlypolysomnography (PSG)can determine 
the presence and severity of nocturnal respiratory 
disorders and hence differentiate the two 
diseases. However, there is a long-standing controversy 
over the need to carry out such a complex and 
expensive test in all the children that presentsymptoms 
that suggest either PS or OSAS [12]. 

Our approach to OSASin the pediatric population 
is primarilybased on clinical assessment. Depending 
on the results of the questionnaire, designed to 
separate minor from major symptoms, and also 
depending on the results of the clinical exam, we 
currently select children with suspect OSASwithout 
other causes of nasal obstruction, malformations, 
metabolic or neuromuscular diseases who may benefit 
from an adenotonsillectomy. Polysomnography 
is carried out onlyin caseof therapeutic failure orin 
selected children. 

The purpose of the paper is to demonstrate the 
validity of the clinical and medical history assessment 
to select children with OSAS and to validate 
the algorithm for the management of surgical 
options for OSAS, keeping polysomnography for 
selected cases only. 

2. 
Methods 
In the period between January 2000 and December 
2003, we assessed 420 consecutive children, who 
presented to our tertiary hospital with nocturnal 


Adenotonsillectomy in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome 

and diurnal respiratory disorders. Patient inclusion 
involved the drawing-up of their history with the 
helpoftheirparentsand completingaquestionnaire 
designed to highlight the presence of: 

. 
Major 
symptoms: (1) Habitual snoring (constant 
nocturnal snoring in the absence of acute phlogosis 
of the airways) since at least 6 months 
unresponsive to therapy; (2) frequent apnea 
(interrupted breathing for more than 10 s, followed 
by a noisy breath) either observed or 
recorded with a camera; (3) fragmented sleep 
(frequent changes of position or awakening). 
. 
Minor 
symptoms: Hyperextension of the head 
during sleep, irritability, failure to thrive, attention 
deficit, hyperactivity disorder; this was completed 
with a detailed ENT examination. 
The examination was completed with a detailed 
ENT examination. 

We defined suspected OSAS in children with three 
major symptoms and at least one minor symptom, 
presence of tonsils, with or without adenoids. Children 
defined as having suspected OSAS were 
included in a prospective study, approved by the 
ethical committee. 

The studied population included 118 patients 
ranging between 2 and 8 years of age (mean age 

5.11 . 
1.22 years), with a male:female ratio of 4:1, 
with history and clinicalevaluation both suggesting 
OSAS. 
We excluded 320 children from the study: 

. 
One hundred and twenty-seven children with 
simple snoring who underwent specific treatment 
or follow up. 
. 
Thirty-two children defined as complicated, i.e. 
affected with cranio-facial disorders, neuromuscular 
disorders, chronic lung disease, genetic-
metabolic diseases, laryngomalacia, or Down 
syndrome who were sent for specific treatment. 
. 
Thirty-seven children under 2 years of age. 
. 
One hundred and thirty-four children who after 
adequate antimicrobial therapyfor chronic infectious 
disease or antiallergictherapyforimmunophlogosis 
presented marked symptomatic relief. 
The group studied underwent complete clinical 
evaluation, paying special attention to the upper 
airways so as to exclude malformations or pharyngeal—
laryngeal reflux pathologies, if necessary 
using a pediatric flexible endoscope and Muller’s 
manoeuvre. The nasal and rhinopharyngeal region 
was assessed with a rigid endoscope with a 2.7 mm 
08 
optics. Adenoidal hypertrophy was gradedfrom1 
to 3 following Wang’s classification [13]. 

Palatinetonsilswere clinically graded from1to4 
depending on the occupied oropharyngeal space as 
follows: grade 1, from 0 to 25% of the oropharynx, 
grade 2, from 25 to 50%, grade 3, from 50 to 75% and 
grade4above 75%.The patientswere assessed with 
nocturnal pulse oxymetry. 

The clinical exam was completed with an phoniatric 
and orthodontic examination to evaluate the 
morphology of dental arch and the occlusion.

Regardless of the size of the pharyngeal tonsils, 
all the selected children underwent adenotonsillectomy 
and were re-assessed after 3 months by 
means of a questionnaire, ORL examination and 
nocturnalpulse oxymetry. PSGwas kept for selected 
cases(Fig. 1). 

Data were evaluated using the x 
2-test. All tests 
with p-value less than .05 were considered statistically 
significant. 

3. 
Results 
We found a significant obstruction of the upper 
airways in 72% of the patients (adenoids grade 3, 
tonsils grade 3 or 4, or both conditions) (85/118); 
the remaining patients (33/118), that is 28%, presenteda 
non significant obstruction (adenoidsgrade 
1—2, tonsils grade 1—2). Ten percent of patients 
presented a mild deviation of the nasal septum (12/ 
118). The presence of malocclusion was highlighted 
in 65% of patients (77/118), such as open bite, cross-
bite, posterior occlusion or multiple simultaneous 
alterations. Nocturnal pulse oxymetry highlighted 
significant cyclic desaturation episodes in 83% of 
cases (98/118). 

Three months after adenotonsillectomy, the history 
of the patient was re-examined and the questionnaire 
readministered. The ENT examination and 
a nocturnal pulse oxymetry were carried out at 
home. All patients were apnea-free. A 80.5% of 
children (95/118) were symptom-free. A 12.5% 
(15/118) continued to present minor symptoms. 
Seven percent (8/118) of children continued to 
snore in a discontinuous fashion without apnea: 
these were further assessed after 6 months with 
nocturnal pulse oxymetry and no oxymetric alteration 
was demonstrated. Most of these patients 
underwent orthodontic treatment with rapidpalate 
dilator, which entailed the disappearance of minor 
symptoms. In one case alone we conducted a polysomnography 
which revealed sporadic snoring episodes 
(20% of total sleep) without apnea or oxygen 
desaturation. 

Regarding adenotonsillar size, the group with 
significant obstruction showed complete response 
in 80% of cases (68/85) while in 20% of cases (17/85) 
minor symptoms were still present. The group with 

non significant obstruction showed complete 
response in 82% of cases (27/33) while in 18% of 
cases (6/33) minor symptoms were still present 
(Table1). The comparison between the two groups 
with the x 
2-test(a 
= 95%) did not show statistically 
significant differences (p 
= 0.05) between adenotonsillar 
size and surgical result.

Discussion 
This last decade has been marked by increasing 
attention being paid to OSAS in the pediatric age 
group. 

The failure to diagnose or treat OSAS may lead to 
serious, even though reversible, consequences for 
the child such as failure to thrive, behaviour alterations, 
neurocognitive disorders and, more rarely, 
cardiopulmonary defects such as cor 
pulmonale. 

Current effortsbypediatricians and specialists in 
this disease focus on increasing the ability to diagnose 
OSAS and to decrease diagnostic delay. 

The recently drawn-up guidelines [6] that envisage 
the use of PSG as the reference method to 
differentiate PS from OSAS, are inapplicable in 
clinical practice due to the cost of this test and 
lack of laboratories that study sleep in the pediatric 
age group. 

Hence, the history and the clinical exam remain 
fundamentallyimportant in the diagnosis of respiratory 
disorders in sleep and, above all, in identifying 
those children who need to be evaluated with a 
polysomnography and who need to undergo all the 
other tests to diagnose the disease undergoing surgery 
or prosthesis deployment [14—20]. Conversely, 
some authors consider that the sole clinical evaluation 
is not enough to identify OSASchildren and that 
PSG should be carried out in all suspected cases 
[16,20]. 

Ourpaper demonstrates that the selection of 
children with suspect OSAS, based on the history 
and clinical evaluation, plays a very important and 
useful role: a significant proportion of the children 
we selected with this method (80.5%) are now 
completely symptom-free and the remaining 
(19.5%) children no longer present the problem 
of apnea, even though they still do present a 
few minor symptoms. We employed nocturnal

but as an additional examination in our clinical 
assessment. 

Taking the decision to proceed with surgery by 
simplyrelying on the history and the clinicalexam is 
a sensitive method but not too specific. OSAS symptoms 
sometimes overlap those ofprimary snoring: in 
this way the indication for surgery may represent an 
excessive form of treatment. However, if it is true 
that primary snoring, mild OSASand severe OSAS are 
different steps of the same continuum, our 
approach to surgery may be viewed as a form of 
prevention regarding a disease that presents important 
potential complications. 

In accordance with the literature, one should 
always attempt medical treatment or watchful 
waiting before proceeding with surgery, bearing in 
mind that primary snoring may be considered a 
common feature of childhood andthat it may spontaneously 
regress [3]. 

It shouldbe pointed out that the decision-taking 
algorithm that we propose(Fig.1)does not consider 
adenotonsillar hypertrophy as the only factor that 
warrants a surgical procedure. 

In fact, the pathogenesis of OSAS is multifactorial 
while adenotonsillar hypertrophy is, in the majority 
of cases, the primary factor, especially in children 
under 6 years of age, when the lymphatic tissue 
reaches a size that is disproportionate to that of the 
upper airways. However, there is no relationship 
between tonsil size and OSAS severity since its 
pathogenesis is a combination between adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy, cranio-facial anatomy (so-called 
thin face) [21,22] and alteration of the muscular 
tone of the respiratory pathway during sleep [23]. 

In the literature, there is unanimous consensus 
for surgery in case of adenotonsillar hypertrophy: 
the resolution of symptoms, in these cases, reaches 
success percentages of 100% in several series 
[16,17,24,25]. Instead, it ought to be underlined 
that adenoidectomy aloneis not enoughto cure this 
disease with the exception of special cases such as 
newborn infants [17,24]. 

As our results have demonstrated, it should be 
noted that in the presence of symptoms that indicate 
OSAS, an adenotonsillectomy is indicated even 
when adenotonsillar size is not too significant, and 
this underscores the multifactorial nature of its 
pathogenesis [21,26,27]. The analysis of the results 
achieved with our series confirms what the literature 
reports. The explanation lies, we believe, in 
the fact that the adenotonsillectomy is capable,due 
to the scarring process that involves the pillars, of 
stiffening the sides of the pharynx and the upper 
part of the palate which is what presumably takes 
place with a palatopharyngoplasty. 

In case of failure, the adenotonsillectomy should 
alwaysbe followedby a PSG before proceeding with 
orthodontic treatment or with further therapies 
(CPAP, uvulopalatopharyngoplasty,cranio-facial surgery, 
hypopharyngeal surgery, tracheostomy). 

Furthermore, PSG must always be performed in 
all the cases that present contraindications for 
surgery and in complicated children, and it should 
be repeated at 6 months after treatment.
