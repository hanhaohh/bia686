ABSTRACT: Childhood obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) acts as a check on 
growth and nutritional status. An increase in sleeping energy expenditure has been 
proposed as a possible mechanism, but to date, no studies have determined whether 
energy requirements (total energy expenditure; TEE) are raised in OSAS. The aim of 
this study was to test the hypothesis that OSAS is associated with increased TEE. 

Eleven children (mean¡SD 5.8¡2.2 yrs of age) with OSAS confirmed by nocturnal 
polysomnography were each matched with a pair of healthy controls (n~22) of the same 
age and sex. TEE was measured using the doubly-labelled water method in all subjects. 
In 10/11 patients TEE was also measured after adenotonsillectomy and changes in TEE 
assessed. 

There was no significant difference in TEE between patients (mean¡SD 
325¡44 kJ?kg-1?day-1) and controls (339¡48 kJ?kg-1?day-1), nor between patients 
and age-and sex-specific literature data on TEE, using the doubly-labelled water 
method. Differences in TEE within patients, before versus after surgery, were minor 
and not statistically significant. 

This study does not support the hypothesis that obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome in 
childhood is associated with increased energy requirements, and suggests that 
alternative explanations for the effect of this syndrome on growth and energy balance 
should be sought.

Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) is 
common in childhood, and is often associated with 
failure to thrive [1–4]. The cause of failure to thrive in 
children with OSAS is unknown. A number of 
features of OSAS might predispose children to 
growth and nutritional problems, including increased 
energy expenditure, anorexia or dysphagia as a result 
of adenotonsillar hypertrophy and/or recurrent infection, 
abnormal growth hormone secretion, and 
nocturnal hypoxia [5–8]. 

Following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy, 
growth and nutritional status tend to improve in 
children with OSAS. In children with failure to thrive, 
this may lead to a resolution of the nutritional 
problem [1, 4, 5, 9] while in children with OSAS 
who are overweight or obese, the nutritional problem 
typically becomes more severe [9]. These clinical 
observations imply that OSAS in childhood is 
associated with a "check" 
on positive energy balance, 
and that this check is not restricted to patients with 
failure to thrive, but applies across the entire spectrum 
of growth and nutritional status. 

There is some evidence that increased energy 
expenditure might act as the check on positive 
energy balance in OSAS. MARCUS et al. [5] demonstrated 
substantial declines in sleeping energy expenditure 
(SEE) in 14 children with OSAS after 

adenotonsillectomy. In the absence of obvious 
changes in energy intake before and after surgery, 
MARCUS et al. [5] suggested that hypermetabolism, 
secondary to increased work of breathing during 
sleep, might be responsible for failure to thrive in 
OSAS. STENLOF et al. [10] studied five adults with 
OSAS and reported that sleeping energy expenditure 
and 24-h energy expenditure in a whole body 
calorimeter were significantly increased relative to 
controls, and declined after treatment. Neither of 
these studies measured TEE, but in order to conclusively 
demonstrate hypermetabolism, that is to establish 
that any increase in SEE results in increased total 
energy expenditure, it is necessary to measure TEE 
directly in free living subjects. At present, this can only 
be done accurately using the doubly-labelled water 
method.An experimentofthiskindis essential 
because any increase in SEE might be offset by 
alterations in other components of energy balance, 
such as reduced activity during the day [11, 12]. 
Measurement of TEE has usefully identified causes of 
energy imbalance in a number of chronic diseases 
including childhood leukaemia [12, 13], human 
immunodeficiency virus infection [14], Rett syndrome 

[15] and cystic fibrosis [16]. The aim of the present 
study was therefore to test the hypothesis that TEE is 
increased in children with OSAS. 

ENERGY EXPENDITURE IN OSAS CHILDREN 

Methods 

Comparison of total energy expenditure between 
patients and healthy controls 

TEE was measured before surgery in 11 patients. In 
all cases, polysomnography was used to confirm the 
presence of OSAS. In order to test the hypothesis that 
OSAS is a hypermetabolic state, TEE was compared 
with controls matched for age (within 12 months), 
sex, and season (within 2 months), using two controls 
for each patient with OSAS. As a further test for 
abnormalities in TEE in OSAS, measurements of TEE 
were compared against two published sources of data 
on childhood energy requirements; estimated average 
energy requirement (EAR) from UK dietary reference 
values [17] and empirically derived values from a 
published compilation of TEE measurements in 
childhood [18]. 

Patients and clinical assessments 

Eleven patients (nine Caucasian, two Asian), with a 
clinical history of OSAS and who were on the waiting 
list for adenotonsillectomy were recruited (table 1). 
Decisions in relation to clinical management were 
made independently of the study. All children had 
been referred to an ear/nose/throat (ENT) surgeon 
with a history of snoring, restlessness, and periods of 
apnoea reported by parents during sleep. In all cases, 
the surgeons judged the children to have adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy on clinical grounds, and had listed 
them for adenotonsillectomy. All patients were free of 
other diseases relevant to their energy balance, and 
were not taking any medication that would have 
influenced their energy balance. 

For the purposes of the research, the presence of 
OSAS was confirmed by overnight polysomnography, 
performed using a portable digital recording polygraphic 
system (Snytectics Medical, Stockholm, 
Sweden). Monitoring was continuous and included 
measurement of oxygen saturation, monitoring of 

Table 1. – Characteristics of patients 

oro-nasal airflow, respiratory and abdominal movements 
by impedance (Medtronic Synectics AB, 
Renstiernas Gata 12, Stockholm, Sweden), and heart 
rate (both by electrocardiography and from the pulse 
oximeter signal). Sleep states and periods of arousal 
were not measured. No data were obtained on 
hypoventilation index and neither end tidal nor 
transcutaneous carbon dioxide (CO2) was measured. 
All sleep studies were performed and analysed by an 
experienced technician who was unaware of the 
patients condition or whether the assessment was 
pre-or postsurgery. Obstructive apnoeas were defined 
as w6 s in duration. Monitoring was performed 
overnight during a natural sleep in hospital with 
sleeping times (presurgery) which ranged from 5 h 
26 min-9 h 55 min. Before surgery, polysomnographic 
studies in all patients showed evidence of obstructive 
episodes with an apnoea index of w1.0 [5]. 

Measurement of body composition and nutritional 
status 

In all patients and controls, body fatness and fat-
free mass were estimated from total body water 
(TBW), assumed to be equal to the dilution space of 

18 (18

oxygen O) [19]. Measurements of TBW were 
converted to estimates of fat-free mass using the 
appropriate age and sex specific "constants" 
for 
hydration of fat-free mass proposed by LOHMAN [20] 

Nutritional status was assessed quantitatively using 
the body mass index (BMI), expressed as an SD score 
relative to contemporary UK reference data [21] after 
measurement of height to 0.1 cm using a portable 
stadiometer (Leicester Height Measure/Invitica 
Oadby, Leicester, UK) and weight to 0.1 kg in light 
indoor clothing using Soehule scales (Seca Alpha 
M770, Dusseldorf, Germany). The BMI is a simple, 
clinical proxy for body fatness and fat-free mass and is 
a useful index of "protein-energy status" 
[22]. Height 
and weight were also expressed as SD scores relative to 
UK 1990 reference data.

expenditure per kg body mass minimized the effect of 
any differences between patients and controls. 

Measurement of energy expenditure 

The doubly-labelled water method was used to 
measure TEE over a 12/13 day period, using a 
protocol described elsewhere [12, 16]. In brief, each 
child received a weighed, sterilized oral dose of 

1.6 mL?kg-1 18O (10% enriched) that was mixed with 
0.06 mL?kg-1 2H (99.9% enriched deuterium oxide). 
Isotopic enrichments of urines and diluted doses were 
measured using isotope ratio mass spectrometry 
(Bureau of Stable Isotope Analysis, London, UK). 
Total energy expenditure was calculated from disappearance 
rates of 18O and 2H using equation A6 of 
SCHOELLER et al. [23] and a food quotient of 0.87 
which gave an energy equivalent for CO2 production 
of 23.7 KJ?L-1. Mean ratio of dilution spaces (2H/18O) 
was 1.05¡0.02. 
Statistical analyses 

Paired differences in total energy expenditure between 
patients and the mean of the two controls were 
tested for significance using a paired t-test. Energy 
expenditure data were expressed as kJ?kg-1?day-1 for 
the purposes of statistical analysis. Both body mass 
and fat-free mass were highly correlated with TEE, 
and the conclusions obtained did not differ as a 
function of the "denominator" 
used to express TEE. 
For clarity of presentation, and ease of comparison 
with other studies, TEE data are described here as 
kJ?kg-1?day-1. 

Results 

Characteristics of patients and controls 

Characteristics of the patients (before and after 
surgery) are given in table 1. None of the patients 
had a maxillofacial syndrome recognized as being 

associated with obstructive sleep apnoea (e.g. Treacher 
Collins or Crouzons disease). 

Overnight polysomnography was carried out in all 
patients prior to surgery, but in only seven of the 11 
patients after surgery (one moved away from the area 
and was lost to follow-up; two did not consent to a 
second polysomnographic procedure; technical failure 
prevented polysomnography in one other). In the 
seven patients with postsurgery polysomnography, 
apnoea index improved in three, worsened in three, 
and was identical to the presurgery assessment in 
another. Overall, apnoea index actually worsened 
slightly after surgery (table 1), though the change was 
not statistically significant (paired t-test). 

Age, fat-free mass, height, weight and BMI SD 
scores did not differ significantly between patients 
and controls. Characteristics of controls are given in 
table 2. 

Total energy expenditure: comparison between 
patients, healthy controls, and literature values 

Data on measured TEE in patients and controls, 
together With TEE estimated from two literature 
sources, are given in table 3. There were no significant 
differences in TEE between patients and controls: 
mean paired difference (patients minus controls) was 
-14 kJ?kg-1?day-1,p~0.43. No significant differences 
were found between patients and age/sex specific 
estimated average requirements [17], or between 
patients and the compilation of literature data on 
age and sex-specific TEE measured by doubly-labelled 
water [18]. 

Discussion 

The present study suggests that children who have 
OSAS, confirmed by polysomnography do not have 
raised TEE. TEE in patients was actually slightly 
lower than that of the healthy control children, but 
did not differ significantly from controls, and was not 
markedly different from literature data. In addition, it 
is unlikely that the levels of TEE observed in patients

DLW: mean age-and sex-specific total energy expenditure 
from a compilation of doubly-labelled water measurements 
[18]. 

with OSAS in this study, lower than UK estimated 
average requirements for energy [17], would have been 
sufficient to produce failure to thrive or act as a 
constraint on growth or nutritional status [11, 17, 18]. 

In 10 of the 11 patients, a second measurement of 
TEE was obtained ¢9 weeks after surgery (mean¡SD 
14¡5 weeks; range 9–25 weeks). The change in TEE 
postsurgery was 1¡38 kJ?kg-1?day-1 and was not 
significant (paired t-test). The original intention was 
to use each patient as his-her own control and use the 
change in TEE as an additional test of whether or not 
TEE altered as a result of surgical resolution of OSAS. 
Since surgery did not resolve OSAS in four of the 
seven patients for whom repeat polysomnography was 
possible, the repeated measurement of TEE did not 
constitute a test of the hypothesis that OSAS is 
associated with increased TEE. However, changes in 
TEE were generally small after surgery. This observation 
strengthens the conclusion that TEE was not 
abnormally high in these patients with OSAS by 
providing repeated measures of TEE which point to 
the same conclusions. In, effect repeating the TEE 
measurements in the presence of OSAS provided 
additional confidence that the TEE of these children 
was not abnormally high. 

There are a number of possible reasons for the 
observation that TEE was not increased in the 
patients with OSAS. In general, the patients were 
not characterized by failure to thrive or severe OSAS. 
This might have diminished the ability to detect any 
abnormality in TEE. However, it is worth noting that 
surgical resolution of OSAS is generally associated 
with marked improvement in nutritional status across 
the entire range of nutritional status: even in obese 
patients, surgery tends to lead to more severe obesity 
[9]. This implies that any effect of OSAS on energy 
balance/growth is not restricted to children with 
failure to thrive, and that OSAS per se acts as a 
check on growth/energy balance. If this is the case, the 

patients should have provided an adequate test of the 
hypothesis that OSAS increases energy intake despite 
their fairly normal nutritional status. It is possible that 
a larger study might have revealed subtle differences 
in TEE between patients and controls. The original 
study design planned for measurements of TEE pre-
and postsurgery to investigate changes in TEE within 
patients after correction of OSAS by adenotonsillar 
surgery. The inability to test adequately for changes 
after surgery in some children, because of the lack of 
improvement, was unanticipated. Nevertheless, data 
on TEE collected presurgery do not suggest any trend 
towards higher TEE in the patients. Finally, it is 
possible that the apparent absence of an increase in 
TEE in the patients with OSAS was due to the absence 
of any effect of OSAS on TEE (the null hypothesis). A 
number of diseases have been believed to be associated 
with increased TEE. The availability of 
accurate measurement of TEE by use of the doubly-
labelled water method has recently shown that many 
of these diseases are not "hypermetabolic" 
[14–16]. It is 
also worth noting that there are many other possible 
mechanisms (independent of any effect of OSAS on 
TEE) for the observation that OSAS acts on a "check" 
on growth/nutritional status in OSAS. 

If SEE is increased in children and adults with 
OSAS, as has been reported [5, 10], the present 
findings imply that any increase in SEE is offset by a 
reduction in other components of energy expenditure. 
This might include reductions in diet-induced thermogenesis, 
resting energy expenditure, or, perhaps more 
likely, activity related energy expenditure [11]. The 
potential effects of OSAS on SEE and TEE are 
complex. Increases in SEE could be due to the energy 
cost of movement/arousal, the energy cost of breathing 
while experiencing partial or complete airway 
obstruction, or alterations in sympathetic nervous 
system activity [10]. Hypoxia might increase or 
decrease SEE [10]. An increase in SEE will only be 
"clinically" 
significant, that is will only increase energy 
"requirements", if all other components of energy 
expenditure remain unchanged [11]. The present data 
confirm that measurement of TEE, rather than just 
SEE or resting energy expenditure, is essential if 
abnormalities in energy expenditure are to be confirmed 
as being clinically significant [11, 12, 14, 16]: 
the present study suggests that the effect of OSAS on 
TEE is not clinically significant. 

If OSAS is not associated with an increase in TEE, 
alternative explanations for improved growth and 
nutritional status after its resolution should be 
considered: there are many alternative hypotheses 
[1–8]. If the problem does have its origins in energy 
imbalance but hypermetabolism is ruled out, limits on 
energy "intake" 
might constrain growth/nutritional 
status in OSAS. Confirming this directly is problematical 
because of the inaccuracy and imprecision of 
methodology for measurement of energy intake [11]. 
MARCUS et al. [5] reported no significant change in 
energy intake after successful adenotonsillectomy, but 
others have reported evidence of improved appetite 
after surgery [4, 24]. Recently, BAR et al. [25] measured 
changes in the IGF-1 axis before and after surgery in 
10 children who had OSAS confirmed by nocturnal 


R.M. BLAND ET AL. 
polysomnography, and found a significant increase 
in serum IGF-1 levels after surgery, which were 
associated with improvements in nutritional status. 
Improvements in weight SD scores observed [25] were 
similar to the present study, though the present study 
reported changes in BMI SD scores, a more sensitive 
indicator of energy balance since they adjust weight 
for height [12, 22]. If this adjustment is not made, 
weight changes can be confounded by changes in 
height. In 7/10 patients in the present study, BMI SD 
score increased, and the increase overall was 0.3¡0.4, 
though this trend did not reach significance. 

The absence of grossly abnormal energy requirements 
in patients with OSAS from the present study, 
together with recent evidence of a role for neuroendocrine 
disturbance [25], suggests that the cause of 
any "check" 
on growth and energy balance in children 
with OSAS is unlikely to be hypermetabolism. Future 
efforts to understand the underlying mechanism 
should therefore focus on the neuro-endocrine axis. 

In previous studies, OSAS has not always been 
assessed using nocturnal polysomnography (the gold 
standard technique; [3, 26–28] either before or after 
surgery. Where nocturnal polysomnography has been 
used in other studies, surgery did not always abolish 
OSAS [1, 26, 28]. The present observation that surgery 
was largely unsuccessful in resolving OSAS was 
therefore not unique. The practical difficulties associated 
with nocturnal polysomnography in young 
children mean that in a number of previous studies it 
was not performed. Since many of these studies did 
not carry out nocturnal polysomnography on, before 
or after surgery, and relied on either an assumption of 
improved OSAS, subjective parental reports, or nap 
polysomnography [9], it is possible that a sizeable 
proportion of children studied did not have OSAS 
[28]. For those studies in which nocturnal polysomnography 
was carried out, it is likely that a proportion of 
children did not experience resolution of OSAS after 
surgery. This raises the possibility that any improvements 
in growth/nutritional status after surgery in 
earlier published reports were not due to the abolition 
of OSAS/increased work of breathing, but to other 
mechanisms, such as changes in sleep pattern. 

Studies on growth, nutritional status and energy 
balance in obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome might 
have implications for other chronic respiratory 
diseases which are said to be characterized by 
increased "work of breathing". Childhood and adult 
obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome is an interesting 
model since, unlike other respiratory diseases, the 
putative mechanism (increased work of breathing) is 
potentially reversible by surgery and/or continuous 
positive airway pressure. In the present study, no 
evidence was found that increased work of breathing 
in children with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome 
was clinically significant. This is consistent with recent 
evidence suggesting that the effect of increased work 
of breathing on energy requirements in cystic fibrosis 
[11, 16, 29] and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 

[30] may have been exaggerated, and with new 
evidence pointing to a neuro-endocrine cause of 
growth and nutritional problems in childhood 
obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome [25]. It may be 
worth exploring neuro-endocrine effects in other 
conditions where "increased work of breathing" 
has 
been considered important.
