ABSTRACT 


INTRODUCTION. 
Habitual 
snoring 
and 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
have 
been 
associated 
with 
bed-wetting 
in 
children, 
and 
effective 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
treatment 
may 
improve 
enuresis. 


OBJECTIVES. 
The 
purpose 
of 
this 
work 
was 
to 
assess 
whether 
habitual 
snoring 
is 
associated 
with 
increased 
incidence 
of 
enuresis 
and 
whether 
severity 
of 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
correlates 
with 
enuretic 
frequency 
and 
to 
evaluate 
brain 
natriuretic 
peptide 
levels. 


METHODS. 
Parental 
surveys 
of 
5-to 
7-year-old 
children 
were 
reviewed 
for 
habitual 
snoring 
and 
enuresis. 
Enuresis 
was 
also 
assessed 
in 
a 
cohort 
of 
378 
children 
with 
habitual 
snoring 
undergoing 
overnight 
polysomnographic 
evaluation, 
and 
brain 
natriuretic 
peptide 
plasma 
levels 
were 
determined 
in 
20 
children 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea, 
20 
with 
habitual 
snoring 
without 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea, 
and 
20 
nonsnoring 
children, 
matched 
for 
enuresis. 


RESULTS. 
There 
were 
17 
646 
surveys 
completed 
(50.6% 
boys; 
18.3% 
black). 
A 
total 
of 
1976 
(11.2%) 
of 
these 
children 
were 
habitual 
snoring 
(53% 
boys; 
25.2% 
black). 
A 
total 
of 
531 
habitual 
snoring 
children 
also 
had 
enuresis 
(26.9%), 
with 
a 
predominant 
representation 
of 
boys 
(472 
boys 
[87.5%]). 
Among 
the 
15 
670 
nonsnoring 
children, 
enuresis 
was 
reported 
in 
1821 
children 
(11.6%), 
of 
whom 
88.8% 
were 
boys. 
However, 
enuresis 
among 
378 
children 
with 
habitual 
snoring 
did 
not 
correlate 
with 
the 
magnitude 
of 
sleep 
respiratory 
disturbances. 
Indeed, 
enuresis 
was 
reported 
in 
33 
of 
149 
children 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
(obstructive 
apnea 
hypopnea 
index: 
2 
per 
hour 
of 
total 
sleep 
time; 
53% 
boys) 
as 
compared 
with 
36 
habitual 
snoring 
children 
with 
enuresis 
(62% 
boys) 
and 
obstructive 
apnea 
hypopnea 
index 
2 
per 
hour 
of 
total 
sleep 
time. 
Brain 
natriuretic 
peptide 
levels 
were 
elevated 
among 
children 
with 
enuresis 
and 
were 
marginally 
increased 
among 
children 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea. 


CONCLUSIONS. 
Habitual 
snoring 
is 
associated 
with 
increased 
prevalence 
of 
enuresis, 
and 
brain 
natriuretic 
peptide 
levels 
are 
increased 
in 
enuretic 
children 
with 
further 
increases 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea. 
However, 
the 
prevalence 
of 
enuresis 
is 
not 
modified 
by 
severity 
of 
sleep 
disturbance. 
Even 
mild 
increases 
in 
sleep 
pressure 
because 
of 
habitual 
snoring 
may 
raise 
the 
arousal 
threshold 
and 
promote 
enuresis, 
particularly 
among 
prone 
children, 
that 
is, 
those 
with 
elevated 
brain 
natriuretic 
peptide 
levels.

NOCTURIA 
AND 
BED-wetting 
are 
common 
symptoms 
among 
adult 
patients 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
(OSA),1 
and 
bed-wetting 
during 
sleep 
may 
also 
be 
associated 
with 
the 
presence 
of 
OSA 
in 
children.2 
Habitual 
snoring 
(HS) 
is 
the 
most 
common 
clinical 
manifestation 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
(SDB) 
in 
children, 
a 
condition 
that 
ranges 
from 
primary 
snoring 
to 
severe 
OSA 
syndrome.2 
The 
association 
between 
enuresis 
and 
SDB 
in 
children 
is 
supported 
by 
documented 
decreases 
in 
the 
frequency 
of 
enuretic 
complaints 
or 
even 
by 
the 
complete 
resolution 
of 
enuresis 
after 
successful 
treatment 
of 
SDB.3–5 
In 
addition, 
2 
surveys 
have 
reported 
the 
presence 
of 
a 
significant 
correlation 
between 
HS 
and 
enuresis.6,7

most 
recent

a 
community 
sample 
of 
children 
in 
Greece, 
found 
that 
those 
children 
with 
HS 
reported 
more 
often 
the 
concurrent 
presence 
of 
primary 
nocturnal 
enuresis 
than 
did 
those 
without 
HS.7 


One 
of 
the 
potential 
mechanisms 
accounting 
for 
the 
increased 
prevalence 
of 
enuresis 
in 
the 
context 
of 
SDB 
may 
be 
related 
to 
the 
release 
of 
both 
atrial 
and 
brain 
natriuretic 
peptides 
(BNPs) 
from 
cardiac 
myocytes 
after 
cardiac 
wall 
distension, 
as 
induced 
by 
the 
increased 
negative 
intrathoracic 
pressure 
swings 
that 
accompany 
the 
increased 
upper 
airway 
resistance 
in 
HS. 
Release 
of 
this 
cardiac 
hormone 
will, 
in 
turn, 
increase 
sodium 
and 
water 
excretion 
and 
will 
also 
inhibit 
other 
hormones 
that 
regulate 
fluid 
homeostasis, 
such 
as 
vasopressin 
and 
the 
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone 
pathway.8 
Indeed, 
in 
a 
very 
recent 
study 
by 
Kaditis 
et 
al,9 
BNP 
was 
increased 
among 
snoring 
children 
and 
seemed 
to 
correlate 
with 
severity 
of 
respiratory 
disturbance 
during 
sleep. 
Thus, 
based 
on 
the 
cumulative 
evidence 
presented 
heretofore, 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
SDB 
may 
increase 
the 
frequency 
of 
enuresis 
in 
children 
through 
BNP-dependent 
mechanisms. 


Based 
on 
aforementioned 
considerations, 
the 
aims 
of 
the 
present 
study 
were 
to 
(1) 
determine 
the 
prevalence 
of 
enuresis 
in 
a 
large 
survey 
of 
young 
school-age 
community 
children, 
(2) 
assess 
whether 
the 
presence 
of 
HS 
would 
be 
associated 
with 
increased 
reports 
of 
enuretic 
symptoms, 
(3) 
determine 
whether 
the 
degree 
of 
severity 
of 
SDB 
would 
be 
accompanied 
by 
a 
corresponding 
increase 
in 
the 
frequency 
of 
enuresis, 
and 
(4) 
determine 
whether 
higher 
morning 
BNP 
levels 
are 
present 
in 
SDB, 
particularly 
when 
enuresis 
is 
present. 


METHODS 


Survey 
Questionnaire 


The 
study 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
University 
of 
Louisville 
Human 
Research 
Committee 
and 
the 
Jefferson 
County 
Public 
Schools 
board. 
A 
previously 
validated 
questionnaire 
was 
used.10,11 
Parents 
of 
all 
children 
5 
to 
7 
years 
of 
age 
enrolling 
into 
the 
Jefferson 
County 
Public 
Schools 
system 
were 
invited 
to 
complete 
a 
detailed 
questionnaire 
about 
their 
child’s 
sleeping 
habits. 
The 
information 
gathered 
through 
the 
questionnaire 
included 
gender, 
age, 
ethnic 
background, 
questions 
on 
whether 
the 
child 
had 
difficulty 
breathing 
during 
sleep, 
mouth 
breathing, 
witnessed 
apnea, 
daytime 
sleepiness, 
and 
enuresis 
and 
its 
frequency. 
Snoring 
and 
the 
severity 
of 
the 
snoring 
were 
also 
included. 
For 
the 
question 
on 
snoring, 
the 
responses 
were 
graded 
as 
“never,” 
“rarely” 
(once 
per 
week), 
“occasionally” 
(twice 
per 
week), 
“frequently” 
(3– 
4 
times 
per 
week), 
and 
“almost 
always” 
(4 
times 
per 
week). 
The 
responses 
on 
the 
frequency 
of 
enuresis, 
were 
graded 
as 
“never,” 
“rarely” 
(once 
per 
month), 
“occasionally” 
(twice 
per 
month), 
“frequently” 
(2–6 
times 
per 
month), 
and 
“almost 
always” 
(3 
times 
per 
week). 
Returned 
questionnaires 
were 
scanned 
into 
a 
computerized 
database 
and 
were 
subdivided 
according 
to 
their 
snoring 
patterns 
into 
nonsnoring 
children 
(responses 
of 
never 
or 
rarely 
on 
snore 
and 
not 
applicable 
on 
loudness 
of 
snore 
in 
questionnaire) 
or 
HS 
children 
(responses 
of 
almost 


always 
[3 
nights 
per 
week] 
or 
always 
on 
snoring 
frequency 
and 
medium 
loud 
to 
loud 
on 
loudness 
of 
snoring). 
Enuresis 
was 
considered 
to 
be 
present 
when 
responses 
were 
in 
the 
frequently 
or 
almost 
always 
range. 
Subjects 
were 
excluded 
if 
they 
had 
any 
known 
genetic 
or 
craniofacial 
syndromes. 


To 
determine 
whether 
the 
severity 
of 
SDB 
is 
associated 
with 
a 
corresponding 
change 
in 
the 
frequency 
of 
enuresis, 
the 
presence 
of 
enuresis 
was 
also 
assessed 
in 
a 
subset 
of 
378 
children 
with 
HS 
who 
underwent 
overnight 
polysomnographic 
evaluation. 
Twenty 
non-
snoring, 
otherwise 
healthy 
children 
with 
(n 
. 
12) 
and 
without 
enuresis 
(n 
. 
8) 
were 
also 
studied 
in 
the 
sleep 
laboratory. 


Overnight 
Polysomnographic 
Evaluation 


Children 
were 
studied 
for 
12 
hours 
in 
a 
quiet, 
darkened 
room 
with 
an 
ambient 
temperature 
of 
24°C 
in 
the 
company 
of 
1 
of 
their 
parents. 
No 
drugs 
were 
used 
to 
induce 
sleep. 
The 
following 
parameters 
were 
measured: 
chest 
and 
abdominal 
wall 
movement 
by 
inductance 
plethysmography 
and 
heart 
rate 
by 
ECG. 
Air 
flow 
was 
triply 
monitored 
with 
a 
sidestream 
end-tidal 
capnograph, 
which 
also 
provided 
breath-by-breath 
assessment 
of 
end-tidal 
carbon 
dioxide 
levels 
(PETCO2; 
BCI 
SC-300, 
Menomonee 
Falls, 
WI), 
a 
nasal 
pressure 
cannula, 
and 
an 
oronasal 
thermistor. 
Arterial 
oxygen 
saturation 
was 
assessed 
by 
pulse 
oximetry 
(Nellcor 
N 
100, 
Nellcor 
Inc, 
Hayward, 
CA), 
with 
simultaneous 
recording 
of 
the 
pulse 
wave 
form. 
The 
bilateral 
electro-oculogram, 
8 
channels 
of 
electroencephalogram 
(2 
frontal, 
2 
occipital, 
2 
temporal, 
and 
2 
central 
leads), 
chin 
and 
anterior 
tibial 
electromyograms, 
and 
analog 
output 
from 
a 
body 
position 
sensor 
were 
also 
monitored. 
All 
of 
the 
measures 
were 
digitized 
using 
a 
commercially 
available 
system 
(Rembrandt, 
MedCare 
Diagnostics, 
Amsterdam, 
Netherlands). 
Tracheal 
sound 
was 
monitored 
with 
a 
microphone 
sensor, 
and 
a 
digital 
time-synchronized 
video 
recording 
was 
performed. 
The 
sleep 
technician 
followed 
patient 
behavior 
and 
confirmed 
sleep 
position 
by 
the 
infrared 
camera 
inside 
the 
room. 
All 
of 
the 
studies 
were 
initially 
scored 
by 
a 
certified 
technician 
and 
were 
then 
blindly 
reviewed 
by 
2 
physicians 
experienced 
in 
pediatric 
polysomnography, 
who 
underwent 
training 
in 
an 
accredited 
fellowship 
program. 


Sleep 
architecture 
was 
assessed 
by 
standard 
techniques.
12 
The 
proportion 
of 
time 
spent 
in 
each 
sleep 
stage 
was 
expressed 
as 
a 
percentage 
of 
total 
sleep 
time 
(TST). 
Central, 
obstructive, 
and 
mixed 
apneic 
events 
were 
counted. 
Obstructive 
apnea 
was 
defined 
as 
the 
absence 
of 
airflow 
with 
continued 
chest 
wall 
and 
abdominal 
movement 
for 
a 
duration 
of 
2 
breaths.13,14 
Hypopneas 
were 
defined 
as 
a 
decrease 
in 
oronasal 
flow 
of 
50% 
with 
a 
corresponding 
decrease 
in 
arterial 
oxygen 
saturation 
of 
4% 
and/or 
arousal.14 
The 
obstructive 
apnea 
hypopnea 
index 
(AHI) 
was 
defined 
as 
the 
number 
of 
apneas 
and 
hypopneas 
per 
hour 
of 
TST. 
Arousals 
were 
defined 
as 
recommended 
by 
the 
American 
Sleep 
Disorders 
Association 
Task 
Force 
report15 
and 
included

is 
generally 
considered 
as 
exceeding 
the 
reference 
range 
in 
children.14,16 


The 
diagnostic 
criteria 
for 
OSA 
included 
an 
obstructive 
apnea 
index 
1 
per 
hour 
of 
TST 
and/or 
an 
AHI 
2 
per 
hour 
of 
TST 
with 
a 
nadir 
oxygen 
saturation 
value 
of 


92%.14 
Correspondingly, 
children 
were 
considered 
to 
have 
HS 
if 
their 
obstructive 
apnea 
index 
and/or 
AHI 
were 
1or 
. 
2 
per 
hour 
TST, 
respectively. 
Control 
children 
were 
defined 
as 
nonsnoring 
children 
with 
an 
obstructive 
AHI 
1 
hour 
per 
TST. 
Plasma 
BNP 
Levels 


From 
the 
378 
habitually 
snoring 
children 
and 
from 
127 
nonsnoring 
healthy 
children, 
we 
matched 
20 
children 
with 
OSA, 
20 
children 
with 
HS, 
and 
20 
control 
children 
for 
age, 
gender, 
BMI, 
and 
enuresis, 
and 
obtained 
fasting 
blood 
samples 
by 
venipuncture 
in 
the 
morning 
immediately 
after 
the 
initial 
diagnostic 
sleep 
study 
into 
EDTA-containing 
tubes. 
Blood 
samples 
were 
immediately 
centrifuged 
and 
frozen 
at 
80°C 
until 
assay. 
Plasma 
BNP 
levels 
were 
then 
measured 
in 
triplicate 
using 
a 
commercially 
available 
ELISA 
kit 
(Phoenix 
Pharmaceuticals, 
Burlingame, 
CA). 
The 
assay 
has 
a 
sensitivity 
of 
0.15 
pg/mL 
and 
exhibits 
a 
linearity 
range 
of 
93% 
to 
97%. 
The 
intraassay 
and 
interassay 
coefficients 
of 
variability 
were 
5.8% 
and 
8.2%, 
respectively. 


Data 
Analysis 


The 
presence 
or 
absence 
of 
enuresis 
was 
the 
main 
outcome 
variables, 
and 
HS 
was 
the 
independent 
variable 
of 
interest. 
Comparison 
of 
habitual 
snorers 
with 
nonhabitual 
snorers 
for 
continuous 
variables 
was 
conducted 
using 
Student’s 
t 
tests 
and 
for 
categorical 
characteristics 
using 
the 
2 
test 
(Yates’ 
correction). 


The 
odds 
ratios 
and 
corresponding 
95% 
confidence 
intervals 
for 
enuresis 
in 
children 
with 
HS 
as 
compared 
with 
those 
without 
HS 
were 
calculated 
using 
univariate 
logistic 
regression 
analysis. 
Multiple 
logistic 
regression 
analysis 
was 
then 
performed 
to 
adjust 
the 
odds 
ratio 
for 
age, 
gender, 
and 
ethnicity 
(SPSS 
11.5 
[SPPS 
Inc, 
Chicago, 
IL]). 
A 
P 
value 
of 
.05 
was 
considered 
statistically 
significant. 


RESULTS 


Population 
Survey 


During 
the 
years 
2000 
–2006, 
a 
total 
of 
58 
117 
questionnaires 
were 
mailed, 
and 
17 
646 
surveys 
with 
complete 
data 
sets 
were 
returned. 
In 
addition, 
2498 
questionnaires 
were 
returned 
but 
had 
data 
missing 
regarding 
either 
enuresis 
or 
snoring. 
An 
additional 
523 
questionnaires 
were 
returned 
with 
a 
signed 
statement 
that 
the 
parents 
refused 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
survey, 
and 
867 
questionnaires 
were 
returned 
because 
of 
a 
wrong 
address. 
Finally, 
329 
questionnaires 
were 
excluded 
be


cause 
of 
the 
presence 
of 
known 
genetic 
or 
craniofacial 
syndromes. 
Thus, 
the 
overall 
response 
rate 
was 
37.6%. 


Of 
the 
17 
646 
complete 
surveys, 
50.6% 
were 
boys 
and 
18.3% 
were 
black. 
HS 
was 
reported 
in 
1976 
(11.2%) 
of 
these 
children, 
of 
whom 
53% 
were 
boys, 
and 
25.2% 
were 
black. 
Enuresis 
among 
HS 
children 
was 
present 
in 
531 
responders 
(26.9%), 
with 
a 
predominant 
representation 
of 
boys 
(472 
boys 
[87.5%]). 
Among 
the 
15 
670 
nonsnoring 
children, 
enuresis 
was 
reported 
in 
1821 
children 
(11.6%; 
P 
. 
.00001; 
odds 
ratio: 
2.79 
[95% 
confidence 
interval: 
2.50 
–3.13]), 
of 
whom 
88.8% 
were 
boys. 
Thus, 
as 
in 
previous 
published 
studies,5,6 
enuresis 
was 
more 
frequently 
reported 
among 
children 
who 
are 
at 
risk 
for 
SDB. 


Overnight 
Polysomnography 


To 
assess 
the 
potential 
effect 
of 
SDB 
severity 
on 
the 
frequency 
of 
enuresis, 
378 
habitually 
snoring 
children 
who 
were 
randomly 
selected 
from 
the 
pool 
of 
questionnaire 
responders 
underwent 
overnight 
polysomnographic 
evaluation 
in 
the 
sleep 
laboratory. 
OSA 
was 
present 
in 
149 
of 
these 
children, 
and 
among 
the 
latter, 
enuresis 
was 
reported 
in 
33 
children 
(53% 
boys). 
Among 
the 
229 
children 
with 
HS 
but 
no 
evidence 
of 
OSA, 
enuresis 
was 
reported 
in 
36 
children 
(62% 
boys; 
P 
value 
for 
OSA 
versus 
HS 
was 
not 
significant). 
There 
were 
no 
significant 
correlations 
between 
the 
categorical 
frequency 
of 
enuresis 
and 
the 
magnitude 
of 
respiratory 
disturbances 
during 
sleep, 
as 
derived 
from 
the 
obstructive 
AHI, 
lowest 
arterial 
oxygen 
saturation, 
or 
the 
respiratory 
arousal 
index. 


To 
examine 
the 
possibility 
that 
sleep 
macroarchitecture 
might 
differ 
in 
enuretic 
children, 
sleep 
structure 
and 
respiratory 
patterns 
were 
also 
compared 
between 
the 
69 
children 
with 
enuresis 
and 
those 
without 
enuresis 
(n 
. 
309). 
As 
shown 
in 
Table 
1, 
no 
major 
differences 
emerged 
in 
sleep 
characteristics 
among 
these 
2 
groups, 
except 
for 
nonrapid 
eye 
movement 
(REM) 
sleep 
stage 
4 
and 
sleep 
efficiency, 
which 
were 
increased 
in 
enuretic 
children. 


Morning 
Plasma 
BNP 
Levels 


BNP 
concentrations 
were 
slightly, 
albeit 
significantly, 
higher 
among 
20 
children 
with 
OSA 
compared 
with 
20 
control 
subjects 
(P 
. 
.02; 
Fig 
1). 
Although 
there 
was 
a 
trend 
for 
higher 
BNP 
levels 
among 
20 
HS 
children 
compared 
with 
control 
subjects, 
the 
differences 
did 
not 
achieve 
statistical 
significance 
(P 
. 
.13). 
In 
contrast, 
a 
prominent 
correlation 
emerged 
between 
enuresis 
and 
increased 
BNP 
levels. 
Indeed, 
among 
the 
12 
otherwise 
healthy 
children 
with 
enuresis, 
BNP 
levels 
were 
significantly 
higher 
(1037.3 
. 
115.5 
pg/mL) 
when 
compared 
with 
the 
8 
control 
children 
who 
did 
not 
have 
enuresis 


(181.0 
. 
19.8 
pg/mL; 
P 
. 
.00001). 
Moreover, 
BNP 
levels 
were 
markedly 
greater 
among 
all 
36 
of 
the 
children 
with 
enuresis 
independent 
of 
whether 
they 
had 
SDB 
or 
not 
when 
compared 
with 
24 
without 
reported 
enuresis 
(Fig 
1).

but 
that 
the 
severity 
of 
SDB 
does 
not 
seem 
to 
impact 
on 
the 
frequency 
of 
enuresis. 
Furthermore, 
we 
show 
that 
sleep 
architecture 
in 
habitually 
snoring 
children 
with 
enuresis 
is 
not 
markedly 
different 
from 
that 
of 
habitually 
snoring 
children 
without 
enuresis, 
although 
some 
subtle 
increases 
in 
sleep 
efficiency 
and 
delta-wave 
sleep 
are 
present. 
In 
addition, 
we 
not 
only 
confirm 
that 
BNP 
levels 
are 
increased 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
OSA 
but 
further 
show 
that 
enuretic 
children 
have 
markedly 
higher 
BNP 
levels 


compared 
with 
nonenuretic 
children 
at 
any 
degree 
of 
SDB 
severity. 


Nocturnal 
enuresis 
refers 
to 
the 
involuntary 
loss 
of 
urine 
after 
the 
age 
of 
5 
years, 
when 
children 
are 
expected 
to 
have 
achieved 
full 
bladder 
control 
at 
night.17 
In 
most 
cases, 
enuresis 
is 
ultimately 
categorized 
as 
primary 
monosymptomatic, 
as 
documented 
by 
the 
absence 
of 
overt 
urogenital 
pathology 
or 
daytime 
voiding 
problems. 
In 
addition, 
enuresis 
is 
also 
classified 
as 
primary 
when 
the 
child 
has 
never 
achieved 
nighttime 
dryness 
and 
secondary 
when 
bed-
wetting 
occurs 
after 
being 
dry 
for 
6 
months.18 
The 
minimal 
frequency 
of 
nocturnal 
urine 
loss 
required 
to 
diagnose 
the 
condition 
has 
varied 
in 
different 
studies 
from 
once 
in 
the 
previous 
year17 
to 
at 
least 
twice 
a 
week.19 
Primary 
nocturnal 
enuresis 
is 
exceedingly 
more 
common 
in 
boys, 
with 
a 
3:1 
gender 
ratio.20 
In 
the 
present 
study, 
children 
presenting 
with 
bed-wetting 
episodes 
3 
nights 
per 
week 
were 
considered 
as 
being 
enuretic, 
and 
the 
overall 
frequency 
in 
this 
large, 
population-based 
study 
of 
young 
school-aged 
children 
was 
similar 
to 
the 
prevalence 
reported 
in 
previous 
studies 
from 
all 
over 
the 
world.6,7,21–26 
Similarly, 
as 
in 
previous 
reports, 
the 
overrepresentation 
of 
the 
male 
gender 
among 
enuretic 
children 
was 
clearly 
present. 


However, 
most 
of 
these 
studies 
did 
not 
examine 
potential 
links 
between 
HS, 
as 
an 
indicator 
of 
risk 
for 
SDB, 
and 
the 
presence 
of 
enuresis. 
Among 
those 
surveys 
that 
included 
HS 
as 
part 
of 
their 
questionnaires, 
an 
increased 
frequency 
of 
enuresis 
was 
generally 
reported 
among 
HS 
children.6,7,21 
For 
example, 
Yeung 
et 
al25 
reported 
that 
46% 
of 
children 
with 
OSA 
diagnosed 
by 
polysomnography 
had 
nocturnal 
enuresis, 
whereas 
Alexopoulos 
et 
al7 
found 
that 
23.3% 
of 
children 
with 
nocturnal 
enuresis 
were 
habitual 
snorers. 
Taken 
together, 
it 
would 
seem 
that 
increased 
upper 
airway 
resistance 
during 
sleep, 
manifesting 
either 
as 
HS 
or 
as 
polygraphically 
documented 
OSA, 
is 
indeed 
associated 
with 
an 
increased 
probability 
for 
enuresis, 
and 
our 
current 
findings 
further 
confirm 
this 
assumption. 
Indeed, 
26.9% 
of

snoring 
children 
reported 
enuresis 
as 
compared 
with 
11.6% 
among 
nonsnoring 
children. 
Surprisingly, 
and 
in 
contradiction 
with 
our 
initial 
hypothesis, 
we 
did 
not 
find 
any 
differences 
in 
the 
frequency 
of 
enuresis 
among 
HS 
children 
with 
or 
without 
OSA. 
Our 
findings 
are 
similar 
to 
those 
of 
Brooks 
and 
Topol,27 
who 
did 
not 
find 
any 
differences 
in 
the 
prevalence 
of 
enuresis 
among 
children 
with 
OSA 
when 
the 
latter 
were 
subdivided 
into 
respiratory 
disturbance 
severity 
categories.27 
It 
is 
possible 
that 
the 
presence 
of 
HS 
alone 
is 
sufficient 
to 
saturate 
the 
effect 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
on 
enuretic-prone 
children 
(see 
below). 


Notwithstanding 
such 
considerations, 
decreases 
in 
the 
frequency 
or 
complete 
resolution 
of 
bed-wetting 
will 
occur 
after 
successful 
treatment 
of 
the 
breathing 
disorder 
during 
sleep. 
Indeed, 
Weider 
et 
al3 
showed 
resolution 
or 
decreased 
frequency 
of 
primary 
nocturnal 
enuresis 
after 
relief 
of 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
by 
adenotonsillectomy. 
Similar 
results 
were 
reported 
by 
Cinar 
et 
al28 
and 
by 
Weissbach 
et 
al29 
in 
enuretic 
children 
who 
underwent 
adenotonsillectomy.27,29 
Furthermore, 
resolution 
of 
enuresis 
was 
also 
noted 
in 
children 
with 
HS 
and 
nasal 
obstruction 
who 
received 
treatment 
with 
intranasal 
corticosteroids.4 


Several 
different 
pathophysiological 
mechanisms 
have 
been 
proposed 
to 
explain 
the 
association 
between 
increased 
upper 
airway 
resistance 
during 
sleep 
and 
nocturnal 
enuresis. 
Of 
the 
3 
major 
mechanisms 
that 
have 
been 
implicated 
in 
uncomplicated 
nocturnal 
enuresis 
in 
children, 
namely, 
hyperactive 
detrusor 
activity, 
polyuria, 
and 
deep 
sleep 
with 
reduced 
arousability,30 
the 
latter 
2 
mechanisms 
seem 
particularly 
propitious 
in 
the 
context 
of 
HS. 
Although 
a 
deficiency 
in 
antidiuretic 
hormone 
is 
highly 
unlikely,31 
increased 
natriuresis 
has 
been 
reported 
in 
enuretic 
children.32 
HS 
could 
lead 
to 
increased 
urinary 
output 
and 
natriuresis 
by 
promoting 
the 
release 
of 
atrial 
and 
BNPs 
through 
increased 
venous 
blood 
return 
and 
atrial 
distension 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
increased 
intrathoracic 
pressure 
swings 
associated 
with 
upper 
airway 
obstruction. 
However, 
supportive 
evidence 
for 
such 
an 
assumption 
is 
somewhat 
conflictive. 
For 
example, 
Patwardhann 
et 
al33 
did 
not 
find 
an 
association 
between 
natriuretic 
peptides 
and 
OSA 
in 
adult 
patients. 
Similarly, 
Pepperell 
et 
al34 
reported 
the 
absence 
of 
any 
significant 
changes 
in 
BNP 
among 
adult 
patients 
with 
OSA 
after 
treatment 
with 
continuous 
positive 
airway 
pressure. 
Conversely, 
Tasci 
et 
al35 
reported 
that, 
although 
no 
differences 
existed 
in 
BNP 
levels 
among 
OSA 
patients 
and 
control 
subjects, 
treatment 
with 
continuous 
positive 
airway 
pressure 
induced 
marked 
decreases 
in 
BNP 
levels 
in 
the 
OSA 
patients. 
Furthermore, 
Kaditis 
et 
al9 
have 
shown 
recently 
that 
increased 
BNP 
levels 
are 
much 
more 
likely 
to 
occur 
among 
children 
with 
HS 
and 
AHI 
5. 
Our 
current 
findings 
confirm 
this 
latter 
report 
and 
add 
additional 
insights 
into 
this 
particular 
issue. 
Indeed, 
in 
the 
present 
study 
we 
controlled 
for 
both 
the 
presence 
of 
enuresis 
and 
the 
degree 
of 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
during 
sleep. 
Under 
these 
circumstances, 
the 
major 
determinant 
for 
increased 
morning 
BNP 
levels 
was 
the 
presence 
of 
enuresis, 
with 
lesser, 
albeit 
significant, 
contributions 
by 
the 
degree 
of 
respira


tory 
disturbance 
during 
sleep. 
Thus, 
in 
children 
with 
a 
preexisting 
propensity 
for 
enuresis, 
the 
already 
heightened 
BNP 
levels 
may 
be 
further 
enhanced 
by 
HS 
or 
OSA 
and, 
therefore, 
tip 
the 
balance 
in 
favor 
of 
more 
pronounced 
enuretic 
symptoms. 


As 
mentioned 
above, 
increased 
arousal 
threshold 
despite 
the 
presence 
of 
micturition 
signaling 
may 
also 
contribute 
to 
the 
onset 
and 
maintenance 
of 
enuresis.30 
Several 
studies 
have 
attempted 
to 
examine 
whether 
sleep 
characteristics 
may 
differ 
among 
children 
with 
and 
without 
enuresis. 
In 
general, 
most 
of 
these 
studies 
have 
reported 
normal 
polysomnographic 
findings 
and 
have 
failed 
to 
identify 
a 
specific 
sleep 
phenotype 
that 
may 
explain 
the 
occurrence 
of 
enuresis.36–40 
In 
the 
present 
study, 
which 
examined 
a 
large 
cohort 
of 
enuretic 
children, 
we 
found 
only 
subtle 
changes 
in 
their 
sleep 
architecture, 
namely, 
increased 
sleep 
efficiency 
and 
stage 
4 
non-REM 
sleep. 
Although 
such 
differences 
in 
sleep 
macrostructure 
cannot 
explain 
the 
putative 
increases 
in 
the 
arousal 
threshold 
of 
enuretic 
children,41–43 
the 
increased 
density 
of 
delta 
frequency 
in 
the 
electroencephalograms 
of 
enuretic 
children, 
which 
is 
supportive 
of 
decreased 
arousability,44 
could 
be 
further 
compounded 
by 
the 
increases 
in 
sleep 
propensity 
associated 
with 
SDB.45 
Thus, 
it 
would 
be 
anticipated 
that, 
in 
children 
with 
already 
preexisting 
elevations 
in 
arousal 
thresholds 
from 
sleep, 
as 
seen 
with 
primary 
monosymptomatic 
nocturnal 
enuresis, 
further 
increases 
in 
such 
a 
threshold, 
as 
dictated 
by 
the 
increased 
sleep 
fragmentation 
associated 
with 
either 
HS 
or 
OSA, 
might 
either 
promote 
the 
appearance 
or 
worsen 
existing 
enuresis 
in 
children. 


The 
association 
among 
nocturnal 
enuresis, 
nocturnal 
polyuria, 
and 
increased 
urinary 
levels 
of 
aquaporin 
2 
has 
been 
noted 
previously 
in 
children,46 
although 
these 
findings 
have 
not 
been 
consistently 
corroborated.47 
Nevertheless, 
the 
possible 
association 
between 
natriuretic 
factors 
and 
induction 
of 
aquaporins 
to 
increase 
urinary 
excretion48 
merits 
additional 
study 
in 
both 
enuretic 
children 
and 
those 
with 
OSA. 


CONCLUSIONS 


In 
summary, 
we 
have 
found 
in 
a 
large 
population-based 
cohort 
that 
the 
presence 
of 
HS 
is 
associated 
with 
marked 
increases 
in 
the 
prevalence 
of 
enuresis 
and 
that 
the 
latter 
does 
not 
seem 
to 
be 
affected 
by 
the 
severity 
of 
SDB. 
Furthermore, 
only 
minor 
increases 
in 
stage 
4 
non-REM 
sleep 
and 
in 
sleep 
efficiency 
emerge 
among 
enuretic 
children 
and 
are 
unlikely 
to 
account 
for 
the 
presence 
of 
enuresis. 
However, 
BNP 
morning 
levels 
are 
markedly 
elevated 
in 
children 
with 
enuresis, 
and 
the 
presence 
of 
SDB 
leads 
to 
further, 
albeit 
small, 
increases 
in 
BNP 
plasma 
levels. 
Taken 
together, 
these 
findings 
suggest 
that 
sleep 
fragmentation 
and, 
to 
a 
lesser 
extent, 
increased 
release 
of 
BNP 
in 
the 
context 
of 
increased 
upper 
airway 
resistance 
during 
sleep 
may 
contribute 
to 
the 
higher 
prevalence 
of 
enuresis 
in 
habitually 
snoring 
children.
