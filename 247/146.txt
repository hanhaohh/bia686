Children; 
Objectives: 
To measure the long-term impact of tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy 
(T&A) on children with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). 
Methods: 
Acontrolled study on 101 OSA children, operated between June 1999 and 
January 2001. The OSD-6 was used to assess the results. The caregivers of these 
Surgery patients were asked about their subjective impression prior to surgery (first evaluation), 
8days after the procedure (second evaluation), and with a minimum follow-up 
of 3 years after the operation (third evaluation). 
Results: 
Mean of follow-up was 61.9 . 
13.1 months (range, 36—75 months). The total 
mean survey score showed a highly significant improvement when comparing first 
evaluation versus second evaluation, first evaluation versus third evaluation, and 
second evaluation versus third evaluation ( p 
< 
0.001). In the same way, we found a 
favourable outcome in the six domains when visits were compared. Only sleep 
disturbance between second and third evaluation did not show a significant improvement 
( p 
> 
0.05). There were not differences in the postsurgical outcome of quality of 
life (QOL) according to the remaining factors studied ( p 
> 
0.05). 
Conclusions: 
Children with OSA who undergo surgery show a significant long-term 
improvement in QOL.

children [1]. The OSA syndrome may cause a wide 
variety of complications if left untreated [2], 
namely, cor pulmonale and right-sided heart failure 
[3—7], left ventricular hypertrophy and left-sided 
heart failure [8], pulmonary and systemic hypertension 
[3,9], failure to thrive [3—5], enuresis [3,10], 
and neurocognitive and behavioural abnormalities 
[11]. 

It is known that the majority of children with OSA 
show dramatic improvements in the physiological 
parameters of sleep after adenotonsillectomy(T&A) 
[12]. For this reason, despite a progressive decrease 
in tonsil and adenoid surgery during the past two 
decades, the importance ofOSA as a surgical indication 
for T&A is increasing [13]. 

On the other hand, in recent years attention has 
been focused on quality of life (QOL) parameters 
after these surgical procedures to treat pediatric 
OSA. However, only short-term evidence for the 
success of these operations in improving patient 
symptoms, health, and well-being has been studied 
[2,11—18]. Thus, long-term effects on the postoperative 
QOL of children with OSA remain 
unknown, although the effect of the operation on 
these areas is an important information for parents 
who are considering the procedure for their child. 

The goal of this work is to study long-term 
changes in quality of life in children operated of 
T&A for OSA. 

2. 
Material 
and 
methods 
We prospectively enrolled 104 pediatric patients 
(<14 years of age) with OSA who received surgical 
treatment at our department. Children were diagnosed 
as having OSA based in the presence of all of 
the following modalities as determined by the standard 
clinical practice of the attending physician: 
medical history, physical examination findings, X-
ray films of the lateral aspect of the neck, and 
overnight recording of pulse oximetry. The pulse 
oximetry was considered positive when the patient 
had two or more episodes of desaturation under 
90%. 

Data of the size of tonsils and adenoids were not 
collected for this research since previous studies 
have shown that there is a poor correlation between 
tonsillar size and oximetric nocturnal findings 
[11,19]. Patients with previous tonsil or adenoid 
surgery (for different diagnosis, not OSA), cleft 
palateorprevious pharyngeal surgery,other surgical 
procedures planned on the same day, craniofacial 
syndromes, neuromuscular disorders, and psychiatric 
disease and parents with inability to answer the 
questionnaire were excluded. 

Surgical techniques were T&A, adenoidectomy 
alone or tonsillectomy alone. The children were 
admitted on the morning of surgery fasted. Adenoidectomy 
was performed by curettage of the nasopharynx 
(suction diathermy was not employedafter 
adenoidectomy in any case), and the operative 
techniques for tonsillectomy were based on individual 
surgeon preferences (‘‘classical’’ dissection 
with pillar suture, monopolar electrocautery, or 
bipolar electrocautery). Overnight monitoring in 
the recovery room was employed in all patients. 

The obstructive-sleep-disorders-6-survey (OSD-6) 
[18], a validated tool for assessing QOL in children 
with obstructive sleep disorders, was used to measure 
the changes in QOL of our patients. This instrumentis 
composed of six domains, which reflect the 
following: (1) physical suffering, (2) sleep disturbance, 
(3) speech and swallowing difficulties, (4) 
emotional distress, (5) activity limitation, and (6) 
level of concern of the caregiver associated with the 
patient’s illness and related symptoms [18].Parents 
ratedthe domains ona scale from0(‘‘no problem’’) 
to6(‘‘could not be worse’’) based on how theyfelt 
the symptoms affect their child. The mean survey 
score was calculated by adding the individual 
domain scores and then dividingby6(total number 
of domains). All these questionnaires were accomplished 
by telephone and/or personal communication 
with the caregivers. They were asked at three 
different moments: prior to surgery (first evaluation), 
8 days after operation (second evaluation), 
and with a minimum follow-up of 36 months (third 
evaluation). Likewise, information about average 
hospitalization time, and bothmedical consultation 
at the Emergency Department and readmission to 
the hospital during the 3 weeks following surgery, 
were registered.In addition to this, parental satisfaction 
with the ENT care and parental satisfaction 
with the hospital attention, were also noted on a 
scale from 0 to 10 (0= could not be worse; 
10 = could not be better). 
Parentalsatisfaction with 
the decision for surgery was registered as a dicotomic 
variable (yes/no). 

The study was performed under the requeriments 
of the Local Medical Ethics Committee. Informed 
consent was obtained from all children’sparents. All 
data obtained were processed by two of the authors 

(M.A. Marti´n-Marti´nez, and E.Pe´rez-Ferna´ndez), on 
an INVES PENTIUM computer using the SPSS statistical 
package (Statistical Software 9.0, 1999). To 
analize the difference of the means of QOL Fried-
man test was employed. A test of repetitive measurements 
was used in order to investigate the 
influence of other variables on the tendency of 
the means. All statistical tests received the same 
level of significance of 0.05.

Results 
Age of the patients of our series rangedfrom 0.9 to 

13.9 years (mean 4.1 . 
1.9 years). There were 67 
females (64.4%) and 37 males in the study (35.6%). 
Mean of follow-up was 61.9 . 
13.1 months (range, 
36—75 months). 
Thetotal mean survey score(see Fig.1)showeda 
highlysignificant improvement when comparing first 
evaluation versus second evaluation ( p 
< 
0.001), 
first evaluation versus third evaluation( p 
< 
0.001), 
and second evaluation versus third evaluation 
(p 
< 
0.001).In the same way, wefoundafavourable 
outcome in the six domains when visits were compared. 
Only the sleep disturbance between second 
andthirdevaluationdidnotshowsignificantimprovement(
Tables1 and2). 

Eighty-five children underwent T&A, 11 adenoidectomy 
alone, and 8 tonsillectomy alone. Mean 
hospitalization time after the surgical procedure 
was 1.5. 
0.4days (range, 1—8 days). Thirteen 
patients (12.5%) required postoperative medical 
consultation, mainlyfor odynophagia,atthe EmergencyDepartment.
Twoof them were readmittedat 
hospital andreoperatedfor bleedingafter surgery. 
Parental satisfaction with the ENT care was 

9.1 . 
1.5(range, 0—10),andparental satisfaction 
with the hospital attention was 8.6 . 
1.9(range, 
0—10). One hundred and one caregivers were satisfiedwith 
the surgical decision(97.1%) and3(2.9%) 
did not. 

Statistical analysis did not reveal any predictive 
factors for improvement in QOL other than undergoing 
surgical therapy. Specifically, factors not 
related to outcome included age ( p 
= 0.064), sex 
(p 
= 0.669), surgical technique ( p 
= 0.548), mean 
hospitalizationtime after surgery( p 
= 0.338), parental 
satisfaction with office ENT visit( p 
= 0.377), 
parental satisfaction with hospital attention 
(p 
= 0.262), parental satisfaction with decision for 
surgery( p 
= 0.245), necessity of postoperative consultation 
at Emergency Department (p 
= 0.070), 
and readmission to the hospital( p 
= 0.968).

Discussion 
Sleep-disorderedbreathing (SDB)(includingOSA) 
causedby enlargedtonsils andadenoidsisincreasingly 
common in early childhood [16].Possible 
changesin healthstatusafter anytreatment (surgical 
or not) can be measured directly or indirectly. 
Although the direct approach is more time-
honored, indirect measurementsof change arepreferable 
in order to avoid the high correlation 
betweenthe initialstateandthe present statethat 
show direct methods [20].For this purpose, thetwo 
validatedinstruments most frequently usedarethe 
OSD-6 [18],and OSD-18 [12,16]. There are other 
QOLmeasures forchildrenwith adenotonsillardisease. 
Stewart [20] validated a 15-item survey for 
tonsil and adenoid morbidity, including recurrent 
infection,butchangeinchildrenwithSDB wasnot 
specifically addressed. Another measureof responsiveness 
of change in QOL is the standardized 
response mean (SRM), which is readily calculated 
as the mean change score divided by its standard 
deviation [21].WehaveusedtheOSD-6, adiseasespecificinstrument 
designed to evaluate changesin 
QOLinSDBbeforeand afterany surgery(e.g.T&A) 
on children with OSA [14,18]. 

Diagnosis ofOSA is a topic hotly debated. Medical 
history, physical examination, X-ray films of the 
lateral aspect of the neck, and/or overnight measurement 
of oxygen saturation can be useful for this

purpose. To evaluate the severity of OSA (mild, 
moderate, and severe) a confirmation by polysomnography 
(PSG) is recommended. However, there 
are few normative data available for PSG [13] in 
children, sleep laboratories able to adequately 
study children are not widely accessible, and the 
studies are time-consuming and expensive [13].On 
the other hand, saturation values below 95% are a 
rare occurrencein otherwise healthy sleeping children 
[22]. For this reason, we believe that overnight 
noctural oximetry is adequate to confirm the diagnosis 
of OSA in pediatric patients. 

Our prospective study has some strengths that 
allowed the collection of sound and consistent 
data.Because it wasprotocoldriven(theOSD-6), 
data were collectedby thesameperson to ensure 
consistency.On theotherhand,indirectmeasurements 
of change were employed [20].Finally,long 
follow-up is most adequate to ensure the consistency 
of the results. The major weakness is that 
‘‘effectiveness’’or ‘‘efficacy’’cannotbeinferred, 
since the study does not have a control group 
because of ethical reasons. 

This is, to our knowledge, the first study of 
pediatric OSA that analizes long-term results in 
QOL after surgical treatment. Previous studies did 
not show if the benefits of surgical therapy for OSA 

last beyond a 6-month follow-up period (Table 3) 
[4,11,13—17]. Our results reflect that in pediatric 
OSA, the improvement in QOL continue after operation 
even beyond this first one and half year period, 
which is a desirable outcome for these patients. 

The data of the parental satisfaction with ENT 
office visit, hospital attention, and decision for 
surgery were not correlated with patient outcome. 
This is an important finding because we 
wanted to show that improvement after surgery 
was due to the surgical procedure itself and was 
not biased by parents who were satisfied with the 
perioperative care. Similar results were reported 
by deSerres et al. [14] in their series of children 
with obstructive sleep disorders. On the other 
hand, although the majority of children underwent 
T&A, other surgical techniques are in 
selected cases just as valuable for treatment of 
pediatric OSA. 

Additionally, the long-term follow-upofour study 
(minimum3years, mean5years) minimizes the bias 
caused for adenoid regrowth [23], and upper airway 
anatomic changes that occur in boys at onset of 
puberty [24]. Both factors can cause the recurrence 
of SDB and appear ‘‘to impair’’ the results of the first 
surgical treatment. With respect to this, previous 
studies showed that the domains with the greatest

Quality of life after surgical treatment of children with obstructive sleep apnea 

change in mean score were sleep disturbance 
[2,14,17], caregiver concern [2,14], and physical 
suffering [2,14] although significant changes also 
occurred for the remainder domains. Our results 
are consistent with these data but in a long-term 
follow-up, all improvement in sleep disturbance is 
obtained during the first 8 days after operation, 
because this domain did not show significant difference 
between the second and third evaluation. 

5. 
Conclusions 
Children with OSA who undergo surgery (mainly 
adenotonsillectomy) show a significant long-term 
improvement in quality of life. All domains of the 
survey, and the total mean survey improve statistically 
after operation. All domains but sleep disturbance 
also showagreat improvement from the 
immediate postoperative evaluation to long-term 
follow-up. Long-term results of the total mean 
survey scores show a statistically significant 
enhancement.
