Objective The purpose of the current study was to examine prevalence of and 
relations between a commonly used measure of nighttime breathing problems, the 
Respiratory Disturbance Index (RDI), and a range of problem behaviors in community 
children. Methods Participants were 403 unreferred children aged 6–12 years. Recruitment 
was completed through public elementary schools. Overnight unattended in-home 
polysomnography was used to assess sleep and breathing. The RDI was used as the indicator 
of respiratory events during sleep. The Child Behavior Checklist and the Conners’ Parent 
Rating Scales-Revised were used to assess behavior. Results Prevalence rates for 
Attention, Cognitive Problems, Aggression, Oppositional behavior, and Social Problems 
were greatest for subjects with high RDIs. Prevalence for Internalizing behaviors was not 
greater for those subjects with high RDIs. Hyperactivity was not strongly related to higher 
RDIs. Conclusions Behavioral problems may exist in the presence of nocturnal breathing 
events in unreferred children. Specific patterns of behavioral morbidity have still not been 
established. Some behaviors, such as hyperactivity, may show differing sensitivity and specificity 
in relation to the RDI.

Behavioral Problems Associated with Sleep Disordered Breathing 323 

Recent research has indicated that children with SDB 
or snoring show higher levels of, and increased risk for, 
behavioral and cognitive abnormalities (Blunden, 
Lushington, Kennedy, Martin, & Dawson, 2000; Chervin, 
Dillon, Bassetti, Gonoczy, & Pituch, 1997; Guilleminault, 
Korobkin, & Winkle, 1981; O’Brien, Mervis, Holbrook, 
Bruner, Klaus et al., 2004; Owens, Spirito, Marcotte, 
McGuinn, & Berkelhammer, 2000; Rosen et al., 2004; 
Schecter, 2002). Studies to date have been correlational in 
nature. The strongest causal data available indicate that 
treatment for SDB can result in significant improvement 
in behavior and school performance (Gozal, 1998; 
Stradling, Thomas, Warley, Williams, & Freeland, 1990). 
Studies that have examined sleep using polysomnography 
in children with previously diagnosed Attention Deficit 
Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) have found increased 
sleep related problems such as sleepiness, reduced Rapid 
Eye Movement (REM) sleep, or awakenings but none 
have found an increased level of nocturnal breathing 
events (apneas/hypopneas) during sleep (Cohen-Zion & 
Ancoli-Israel, 2004; Golan, Shahar, Ravid, & Pillar, 2004; 
O’Brien et al., 2003). 

A wide range of behavioral problems have been associated 
with SDB or snoring in children including somatic 
complaints, anxiety/depression, aggression, oppositional 
behavior, conduct problems, inattention, and hyperactivity 
(Blunden et al. 2000; Chervin et al., 1997; Chervin et 
al., 2002; Chervin, Dillon, Archbold, & Ruzicka, 2003; 
Lewin, Rosen, England, & Dahl, 2002; Rosen et al., 2004). 
Behaviors associated with ADHD, primarily inattention 
and hyperactivity, have been the focus of multiple studies. 
The observation of hyperactive behavior in the context of 
actual or reported nocturnal breathing problems has led to 
the hypothesis that a potentially significant proportion of 
children with SDB are being diagnosed with ADHD and 
that this association could have a substantial public health 
impact (Chervin et al., 1997; Lewin et al., 2002). 

Nocturnal breathing events such as apneas and 
hypopneas (abnormal breathing events during sleep 
that are less severe than apneas) have been regularly 
related to behavior problems, but only inconsistently 
related to specific behavior problems. For example, 
one study found no relationship between nocturnal 
breathing events and hyperactivity (Chervin et al., 
2002), and two studies using small samples found 
behavioral problems to actually be lower for mild 
versus moderate SDB (Owens et al., 2000; Lewin et al., 
2002). A recent prospective study of school-aged children 
(with a sample heavily weighted with formerly pre-
term subjects and including subjects with primary 
snoring) found evidence of increased hyperactivity 

along with a broad range of behaviors including internalizing 
behaviors (Rosen et al., 2004). Thus, the 
studies to date provide variable empirical support for 
the hypothesis that children with SDB exhibit specific 
patterns of behavior problems. There are several possible 
methodological reasons for a lack of consistency 
or pattern. Early studies did not utilize standardized 
behavioral measures. Moreover, some studies have 
used only parent report for sleep and breathing problems, 
and others included subjects with primary snoring. 
While research has positively related nocturnal 
breathing problems to daytime behaviors in children, 
few have used polysomnograms (PSGs) together with 
standardized behavioral measures. 

Regardless of the specificity of behavioral consequences 
related to nocturnal breathing problems, clinicians 
and researchers will be limited in determining 
their importance until rates of relevant behaviors, nocturnal 
breathing events, and their joint prevalence or 
comorbidity are established. Base rates need to be 
derived from large community-based samples. Rates of 
pediatric behavioral problems across a wide range of 
severity of breathing events during sleep in a healthy 
sample are useful for comparison with clinical samples. 
Finally, examination of these relationships in healthy 
subjects is important because the clinical threshold for 
the number of apneas and hypopneas has not been 
established for children. 

The analyses presented here are derived from the 
Tucson Children’s Assessment of Sleep Apnea (TuCASA) 
study, a cross sectional cohort of healthy children. Previous 
analyses from the TuCASA study have examined the feasibility 
of in-home polysomnography (Goodwin et al., 
2001), the impact of SDB on learning (Kaemingk et al., 
2003), association of parasomnias and SDB (Goodwin 
et al., 2004), relationship between ventilatory drive and 
SDB (Fregosi et al., 2004), correlation of pharyngeal size 
with SDB (Fregosi et al., 2003), prevalence of clinical 
symptoms of SDB (Goodwin et al., 2003), relationship of 
SDB to blood pressure (Enright, Goodwin, Sherrill, Quan, 
& Quan, 2003), and normative values for sleep (Quan 
et al., 2003).1 The current analyses are the first from

TuCASA to document the association between nocturnal 
breathing events and comorbid behavioral problems. 
We hypothesized that the occurrence of 
hypopneas and apneas as defined by an elevated Respiratory 
Disturbance Index (RDI) would be associated 
with higher levels of reported problems with attention 
and a broad range of externalizing behaviors. 

Methods 

Participants 


The Tucson Unified School District (TUSD) and University 
of Arizona Institutional Review Boards 
approved the study protocol. All families completed 
approved parental consent and child assent forms 
before participating in the study. The design of the 
TuCASA study specified recruitment of 6–12-year-old 
Hispanic and Caucasian children to undergo an unattended 
home PSG and perform a neuropsychological 
and behavioral assessment (Goodwin et al., 2001). 
Subjects were recruited through the TUSD, a large district 
with a population representative of children living 
in Southern Arizona. At the time of initial contact parents 
were asked to complete a short sleep habits questionnaire 
(created for this study), related to typical 
bedtime behaviors, and to provide their contact information 
if they would allow study personnel to call 
them for further participation. Approximately, 33% 
(2,327/7,055) of those families who were sent questionnaires 
returned them. Of those families, 52% provided 
information to allow for additional contact. 

Children were excluded from the study if there was a 
history of head injury, tonsillectomy, mental retardation, 
or asthma. Children with known sleep problems or 
emotional–behavioral disorders (e.g., ADHD) were included 
in the study. Approximately 1 month after the PSG, each 
child underwent a neuropsychological evaluation. Parents 
completed a behavioral assessment by filling out the Child 
Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the Conners’ Parent Rating 
Scales-Revised (CPRS-R) at the time of the neuropsychological 
evaluation. Approximately, 95% of children who 
completed PSG studies also participated in the behavioral 
assessment portion of the study. Families were paid $25 for 
participation in the evaluation. The present analyses utilize 
the first 403 subjects who met inclusion/exclusion criteria, 
whose overnight PSG was technically acceptable, and who 
completed behavioral assessment measures. 

Measures 


The CBCL (Achenbach, 1991) allows assessment of 118 
parent-reported behavioral and emotional problems of 

children aged 4–18. Parents rate their child’s behavior 
on a three-point scale (Not True, Somewhat True, or 
Very/Often True). In addition to eight syndrome scales, 
the CBCL includes a Total problem score, and higher 
order Internalizing and Externalizing scales. Internalizing 
scales include Anxious/Depressed, Withdrawn and 
Somatic Complaints. Externalizing scales include 
Aggressive Behavior and Delinquent Behavior. Three 
other syndrome scales, Social Problems, Thought 
Problems, and Attention Problems are also included in 
the measure. A T-score (M = 50, SD = 10) over 65 was 
considered to indicate moderate to severe clinical 
impairment. 

The CPRS-R is a well validated 80-item behavior 
rating scale that measures symptoms of ADHD (Hyperactivity, 
Impulsivity, and Inattention) as well as 
comorbid behaviors such as Oppositional behavior, 
Anxiety, and Somatic Complaints (Conners, Sitarenios, 
Parker, & Epstein, 1998). CPRS-R scales focus on 
behaviors central to a diagnosis of ADHD such as Cognitive 
Problems and Hyperactivity. Additionally, several 
scales measure behaviors that are commonly 
comorbid with Inattention and Hyperactivity. Three 
scales on the CPRS-R are considered internalizing correlates 
of ADHD (Anxious-Shy, Perfectionism, and Psychosomatic 
Complaints). Behaviors are rated on a four-
point scale that ranges from “Very True” to “Not True.” 
Seven of the scales on the CPRS-R are derived directly 
from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV (DSM) 
criteria for ADHD (American Psychiatric Association, 
1994). The remaining scales were developed empirically. 
A T-score is derived for each scale, based on 
a large age and gender specific normative sample. 
A T-score over 65 is considered to indicate moderate to 
severe clinical impairment (Conners, 1997). 

Polysomnography 


An unattended home-based PSG was scheduled as soon 
as possible after recruitment. Methods for obtaining 
polysomnographic data have been described previously 
(Goodwin et al., 2001). In adults, home-based PSG has 
been shown to provide results similar to PSG studies 
performed in the laboratory (Iber et al., 2004). Briefly, 
a two-person, mixed gender team arrived at the home 
approximately 1 hour before the child’s normal bedtime. 
Questionnaires were administered, and anthropometric 
and other physiological measurements were 
completed. Unattended PSGs were obtained using the 
Compumedics PS-2 system (Abbotsford, Victoria, 
Australia). The following signals were acquired as part 
of the montage: C3/A2 and C4/A1 electroencephalogram, 


Behavioral Problems Associated with Sleep Disordered Breathing 325 

right and left electrooculogram, a bipolar submental 
electromyogram, thoracic and abdominal displacement 
(inductive plethysmography bands), airflow (nasal/oral 
thermister), finger pulse oximetry, electrocardiogram 
(single bipolar lead), snoring microphone, body position 
(Hg gauge sensor), and ambient light (sensor attached 
to the vest to record on/off). 

The Compumedics software system was used to 
process all PSGs. Scoring has been described in detail 
previously (Goodwin et al., 2001). Briefly, sleep stages 
were scored according to Rechtshaffen & Kales, 1968) 
criteria. Apneas were scored if the amplitude (peak to 
trough) of the airflow signal using the thermister 
decreased below at least 25% of the amplitude of “baseline” 
breathing (identified during a period of regular 
breathing with stable oxygen levels), if this change 
lasted for > 6 seconds or 2 breath cycles. Hypopneas 
were designated if the amplitude of any respiratory signal 
decreased below (approximately) 70% of the amplitude 
of “baseline” and if the thermister signal did not 
meet the criterion for apnea. For this study, the RDI 
was defined as the number of respiratory events 
(apneas and hypopneas) per hour of the total sleep 
time irrespective of any associated oxygen desaturation 
or arousal. 

Polysomnograms with less than 4 hours of scorable 
oximetry were classified as failed studies and not 
used in analyses. A single registered polysomnographic 
technologist, who was required to demonstrate a complete 
understanding of the study’s scoring rules and to 
articulate reasons for assigning epoch-by-epoch codes 
for sleep and respiratory scoring, scored all studies. 
Similar to the quality control procedures used for the 
multicenter Sleep Heart Health Study, approximately 
5% of studies were rescored by the same scorer on a 
blinded basis to determine consistency in scoring 
(Redline et al., 1998). No systematic differences were 
observed between initial and rescored studies. 

Analyses 


All statistical procedures were completed using SPSS 
Version 11. Results were summarized as M ± 
SD or by 
percentages. For each behavioral measure, raw scores 
were converted to age and gender standardized T-scores 
(M = 50, SD = 10). Results are generally presented as 
those pertaining to the entire sample followed by 
results related to comparisons between subgroups of 
the RDI score distribution. One-way analysis of variance 
was used to test differences between means. Cohen’s d 
effect sizes (Cohen, 1988) and 95% confidence intervals 
were calculated as indicators of standardized mean 

differences between groups. Odds ratios were used to 
indicate increased probability of behavioral morbidity 
given membership in the high RDI subgroup. Cut 
points for continuous variables used in odds ratios 
were based on generally agreed upon levels of indicated 
variables, such as using at least a “moderate to 
severe” level of behavioral problems or based on the 
most extreme portion of the sample for RDI. A conservative 
cut point using the upper 15% of the RDI score 
distribution was utilized here. Diagnostic criteria for 
SDB using RDI have not been established in children 
(Schecter, 2002). 

Results 

Characteristics of the sample are shown in Table I. 
Obesity was defined using age, gender, and ethnicity-
specific norms (Rosner, Prineas, Loggie, & Daniels, 
1998). Average sleep architecture values from the overnight 
polysomnography are in Table II. The mean RDI 
for the sample was 5.29 (SD = 4.80), the median was 
4.30, and the range was .10–72.4. There was no difference 
between the average RDI for Caucasian (RDI = 
5.36, SD = 5.49) and Hispanic (RDI = 5.19, SD = 3.39) 
subjects (F = .123, p = .725). Sixty-three subjects were 
classified as the “high RDI” group that was defined as 
the upper 15% of the RDI score distribution. This left

Table III shows CBCL means, F ratio from the analysis 
of variance, and Cohen’s d effect sizes. Most mean CBCL 
scale scores for the high RDI group were in or just above the 
average range (45–55). Mean CBCL scores were significantly 
higher on the Aggressive, Attention Problems, Social Problems, 
and Thought Problems for those subjects in the upper 
15% of the RDI. In addition, the higher order scale scores, 
Total and Externalizing were significantly higher for the high 
RDI subgroup. Effect sizes for scales with significant Fratios 
were small and ranged from .22–.35 (Cohen, 1988). Effect 
sizes over 0.2 were noted in 8 of the scales with the two 
largest effect sizes associated with the Aggressive (.35) and 
Social Problems (.33) scales. 

Table IV shows the proportion of children in the 
high RDI group who scored in the clinical range for 

CBCL scales in comparison to the total cohort. Significant 
odds ratios, indicating a greater probability of having 
a CBCL score in the clinical range given a high RDI, 
were found for Attention Problems (24% prevalence), 
Social Problems (21% prevalence), and Externalizing 
Behaviors (16% prevalence). The differences in prevalence 
rates between the two RDI subgroups ranged from 
2 to 10 with Attention Problems and Social Problems 
showing the highest values. 

Table V shows mean CPRS-R scale scores by RDI

mean Conners’ scores for the group representing the upper 
15% of the RDI distribution were significantly greater than 
those in the lower 85% of the distribution. Effect sizes for 
scales with significant F ratios were small and ranged from 
.27 to .42. Nine of the scales showed effect sizes over >.20.

The two largest effect sizes were associated with the Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual-IV (DSM) Inattentive (.42) 
and the Cognitive Problems (.40) scales. 

Table VI shows prevalence rates and odds ratios for 
the CPRS-R scales. Significant odds ratios (>1) were 
found for the Oppositional, Cognitive Problems, Social 
Problems, Psychosomatic, ADHD Index, and DSM Total 
scales. The most prevalent behavior problems for the high 
RDI group were found on the DSM Total (25%), Conners’ 
Oppositional (24%) and Cognitive Problems (24%) 
scales. The differences in prevalence rates between the 
two RDI subgroups ranged from –1 to 14 with Oppositional 
and DSM Total scales showing the largest values. 

Discussion 

This descriptive cross-sectional analysis of unreferred 
school children showed positive associations between 

the number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep 
and a range of daytime behavior problems. An increased 
frequency of aggressive or oppositional behavior, as 
well as cognitive/attention and social problems, were 
apparent for those subjects with a relatively high RDI 
across two standardized behavioral measures. Although 
the overall scale means were in the average range, 
almost twice as many children with elevated RDIs were 
identified as having these kinds of moderate to severe 
behavioral problems on the CBCL and the Conners’ 
when compared to the rates of those problems for the 
remainder of the sample. 

No clear pattern of behavioral morbidity has been 
associated with pediatric sleep-related breathing problems. 
The types of behaviors that were most prevalent 
in the context of high RDI were cognitive, externalizing, 
and social behaviors. The types of externalizing behaviors 
most prevalent were aggressive and oppositional, 


328 Mulvaney et al. 

but not delinquent. Hyperactivity was not strongly 
associated with higher RDI. It is unclear whether the 
increased ADHD Index prevalence rate we observed 
could be attributed to either hyperactivity or inattention 
because that scale measures both behaviors. Overall, 
behaviors such as withdrawal, perfectionism, and 
anxiety/depression were not more prevalent in the 
context of a high RDI. Social problems, consistently 
related to RDI across the two behavioral measures, are 
measured by items related to being liked by other children, 
shyness/preferring to be alone, and interactions 
with peers. Problems with social behavior may be a 
corollary of aggressive and oppositional behaviors as 
well as attention or cognitive problems. 

These results are consistent with some clinical 
studies that found greater mean levels of behavioral 
problems in children with SDB compared to normal 
subjects, or an increased percentage of children with 
SDB showing behavior problems in a clinically relevant 
range. Our results extend these findings by demonstrating 
that healthy children in the general population 
with relatively greater severity of PSG-documented 
nocturnal breathing events are more likely to exhibit 
behavior problems. The pattern of behavioral problems 
found here are somewhat similar to Rosen et al., 2004. 
Although that study utilized the same measures and 
analytic approach, direct comparison to that cohort is 
difficult given the over-sampling of formerly preterm 
subjects and inclusion of primary snorers. The results 
presented here do not strongly confirm some previous 
research indicating a positive relationship between SDB 
(or suspected SDB) and hyperactivity in children (Ali et al., 
1993; Chervin et al., 1997; Chervin et al., 2002; 
Guilleminault et al., 1981). However, the results are 
more consistent with Chervin and Archbold (2001) 
who did not find positive linear or nonlinear relations 
between CPRS-R Hyperactivity and components of 
PSG-documented SDB. 

Several caveats should be considered in the interpretation 
of this study. First, the study is correlational 
and does not provide confirmation of a causal relationship 
between RDI and behavior problems. Prospective 
longitudinal studies will allow strong causal 
inferences regarding the developmental relationship 
between these two problems. Second, behavioral measures 
were dependent upon parent report only. We did 
not engage teachers or young subjects in evaluating 
behavior. Multiple informants and multiple methods of 
measuring behavior will provide the best convergent 
(or divergent) evidence of behavioral problems. 
Research in pediatric SDB and behavior will benefit 

from direct observation of behavior over time to capture 
qualitative characteristics and within-subject variability. 
Finally, diagnostic criteria for SDB in children 
are not yet well defined. The RDI is the most common 
objective index used to define severity of SDB, but 
definitive diagnostic or risk-related cut points have not 
yet been established. Research on the specificity and 
sensitivity of behavior problems across a wide range of 
RDI severity may help determine the usefulness of 
behavioral measures in setting pediatric diagnostic 
criteria. 

Documentation of relationships between behavior, 
cognition, sleep, and breathing are important, as 
abnormal cognition and behavior are the symptoms 
that may be most readily noticed by school professionals 
or caregivers. The challenge to identification of SDB 
through behavioral problems may be finding specific 
patterns of associated behaviors. Behavior problems in 
children are final common pathways related to multiple 
etiologies. One etiology may be breathing problems 
during sleep. Unfortunately, the behavioral and cognitive 
problems associated with nocturnal breathing 
events may not fit precisely into current behavioral 
dimensions or categories. For example, nocturnal 
breathing events may actually lead to a disregulation of 
behavior, not a particular tendency toward specific 
behavior problems. Disregulation or disinhibition may 
be the best labels for the behaviors found here as it 
could account for aggression, inattention, and social 
problems. Although hyperactivity may be a result of 
disinhibition in ADHD and other disorders, it is an 
intermittent sign in this range of RDI severity. 

In conclusion, we found that children sampled 
from an unreferred general population with a high 
RDI have a greater prevalence of abnormal behavior as 
assessed on two validated and commonly used behavioral 
assessment instruments. These data provide additional 
evidence that evaluation of SDB should be considered 
in children exhibiting moderate to severe levels of 
some abnormal behaviors, specifically cognitive problems, 
aggression/opposition, and/or social problems. 
Behaviors may have differential specificity and sensitivity 
in relation to SDB. Hyperactivity may be more 
reliably associated with more severe SDB. Additional 
data will be collected from the TuCASA study to further 
explore these relationships within a longitudinal 
analytic approach. Finally, further exploration of a 
wide range of behavioral symptoms as well as potential 
mediators and moderators of behavioral morbidity 
associated with SDB in children should continue to be 
pursued.
