Summary 

Objective: To study changes in sleep behavior and quality of life in children after 
adenotonsillectomy for severe obstructive sleep apnea identified by a respiratory 
distress index . 
30. 
Methods: Children enrolled in the study underwent adenotonsillectomy and had both 
pre-and post-operative polysomnography. Caregivers also completed an OSA-18 
quality of life survey prior to polysomnography and within 6 months of surgery. 
Paired Student’s t-tests were used to compare pre-and post-operative scores. 
Results: The study population included 29 children. The mean age was 7.1 years 
(range 1.4—17.0). The most common comorbidities were obesity, asthma and allergic 
disease. The mean pre-operative RDI was 63.9 and the mean post-operative RDI was 

14.2 (P < 
.0001). The mean total OSA-18 score before surgery was 77.6 and after 
surgery was 33.2. The differences in pre-and post-operative OSA-18 total scores and 
domain scores were significant (P < 
.0001). 
Conclusion: Children with severe OSA who undergo adenotonsillectomy show a 
significant improvement in RDI and in quality of life over a period of several months 
after surgery. However, OSA does not resolve in the majority of these children and 
post-operative PSG is recommended to identify those who may require additional 
therapy.

R.B. Mitchell, J. Kelly 
have acute respiratory compromise after adenotonsillectomy 
when compared to children with mild or 
moderate OSA [6]. Therefore, it has been recommended 
that children with severe OSA be monitored 
overnight after adenotonsillectomy [6,7]. Suen et 
al. [8] showed that children with severe OSA are less 
likely to have complete resolution of OSA after 
adenotonsillectomy and recommended that they 
undergo routine post-operative polysomnography 
[7]. 

It is known that the general population of children 
with OSA shows dramatic improvements in the 
physiological parameters of sleep after adenotonsillectomy 
[8]. It is also known that these children 
show marked improvement in quality of life after 
surgery [9,10]. However, children with severe OSA 
are different than children with mild or moderate 
OSA with respect to possible long-term complications 
of the disorder, post-operative recovery and 
resolution after surgical therapy [2,6,8]. Therefore, 
it is important to establish the extent to which 
children with severe OSA improve after adenotonsillectomy 
relative to the general population of 
children. The present paper examines the changes 
in the respiratory distress index (RDI) as measured 
by full-night polysomnography [11] and in quality of 
life as measured by the OSA-18 survey [12] after 
adenotonsillectomy in children with severe OSA. 

2. Methods 
Approval for this study was obtained from the institutional 
review board of the University of New 
Mexico School of Medicine, Albuquerque. Children 
with a sleep disturbance who were shown to have 
severe obstructive sleep apnea by full-night polysomnography 
(PSG) were included in the study. The 
caregivers of these children were asked to complete 
an informed consent document before enrolling 
their child in the study. Exclusion criteria included: 

(1) children less than 1 or greater than 18 years of 
age; (2) children who had a previous adenotonsillectomy; 
and (3) children with a respiratory distress 
index (RDI) less than 30. 
For each child the following was recorded: age, 
gender, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI) and associated 
comorbidities. Age and gender specific BMI 
percentiles were calculated and children were 
divided into four groups according to published 
guidelines [13]. Group 1 included children who were 
underweight with a BMI . 
5th percentile; Group 2 
included children who were of normal weight with a 
BMI > 
5th < 
85th percentiles; Group 3 included 
children who were at risk of being overweight with 
a BMI . 
85th < 
95th percentiles; and Group 4 

included children who were overweight with a 
BMI . 
95th percentile. 

The effectiveness of adenotonsillectomy for OSA 
as therapy to improve the physiological parameters 
of sleep was evaluated using PSG [11]. A certified 
sleep medicine physician interpreted the results of 
all PSGs. The RDI, defined as the average number of 
apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep [14], was 
used for diagnosis of OSA prior to surgery. Severe 
OSA was defined as an RDI . 
30. Children enrolled in 
the study also underwent a second PSG within 6 
months after surgery and findings were classified as: 
mild (RDI . 
5to < 
10); moderate (RDI . 
10 to < 
30); 
or severe (RDI . 
30). Data on the sizes of the tonsils 
and adenoids were not collected for this research 
since previous studies have shown that there is a 
poor correlation between tonsillar size and polysomnography 
findings [8,15]. 

Improvements in quality of life after adenotonsillectomy 
for severe OSA were evaluated using the 
OSA-18 survey completed before and within 6 
months after surgery. This survey comprises 18 
items in five domains of sleep disturbance, physical 
suffering, emotional distress, daytime problems 
and caregiver concerns. The domains of emotional 
distress and daytime problems contain three items 
while the other domains contain four. A point scale 
is used ranging from 1 (=none of the time) to 7 (=all 
of the time) to grade the relative severity of the 
problem addressed in each item. The total score 
and the domain scores were recorded. 

A power analysis indicated that a sample size of 
29 is adequate to detect a 20 point difference in 
OSA-18 total score and a difference of 10 in RDI with 
80% power and a 
= .05. Based on the original study 
by Franco et al. [12] a change in OSA-18 total score 
from 80 to 60 indicates a change from severe to 
moderate impact on health-related quality of life. A 
change in RDI from 30 to 20 indicates a change from 
severe to moderate OSA [1]. Therefore, the present 
study has sufficient power to detect a clinically 
significant change in health-related quality of life 
based on OSA-18 total score and in the physiological 
parameters of sleep as measured by RDI. 

Caregivers were asked to complete the first OSA18 
survey prior to PSG. Children with severe OSA 
then underwent a monopolar bovie adenotonsillectomy. 
Caregivers were asked to complete the OSA-18 
survey a second time after surgery and post-operative 
PSG was performed on all children enrolled in 
the study. The OSA-18 difference score was derived 
by subtracting the mean post-operative score from 
the mean pre-operative score. The standardized 
response mean (SRM), defined as the difference 
score divided by the standard deviation of the 
difference score, was used to document the extent 


Outcome of adenotonsillectomy for severe obstructive sleep apnea in children 

of improvement after surgery. The 95% confidence 
intervals (95% CI) for the total score and domain 
scores of the OSA-18 survey were also calculated. 
The two-tailed paired Student’s t-test was used to 
evaluate the significance of differences in the pre-
and post-operative OSA-18 surveys. The same test 
was used to evaluate the significance of differences 
in pre-and post-operative RDI. A P-value < 
.05 was 
considered to be significant. 

3. Results 
Thirty-five children were included in the study. 
Three of these children were lost to follow-up, 
one did not have post-operative PSG, and the caregivers 
for two children did not complete the postoperative 
OSA-18 survey. As a consequence, the 
study population included 29 children. Twenty-
two of the children (76%) are male. The mean age 
of the children at the time of inclusion in the study 
was 7.1 years, and the range was 1.4—17.0 years. 
Thirteen children were Hispanic or Latino, 10 children 
were non-Hispanic or Latino White, one was 
Native American, one was African American and in 
four children the ethnicity was described as 
‘‘other’’. The most common comorbidities were 
obesity, asthma and allergic disease. Fourteen children 
were obese, nine had asthma and six had 
allergic disease. Twelve children had two or more 
comorbidities and eight children had no comorbidities. 
Based on BMI percentiles, 3 children were in 
Group 1 (underweight), 9 were in Group 2 (normal 
weight), 3 were in Group 3 (at risk of being overweight) 
and 14 were in Group 4 (overweight). 

The mean interval between the first OSA-18 survey 
and surgery was 2.0 months and the mean 
interval between surgery and the second survey 
was 1.8 months. The mean interval between the 
two surveys was 3.8 months. The mean interval 
between the first PSG and surgery was 1.4 months 
and the mean interval between surgery and the 
second PSG was 5.8 months. The mean interval 
between the two PSGs was 7.2 months. 

Pre-and post-operative PSG results are summarized 
in Table 1. The mean pre-operative RDI was 

63.9 and the mean post-operative RDI was 14.2. The 
P-value for this difference in scores is <.0001. Postoperative 
PSG showed that nine children (31%) had 
an RDI < 
5 indicating no evidence of OSA. Twenty 
children had an RDI . 
5 indicating persistent postoperative 
OSA. Nine of the 14 children (64%) in 
group 4 (overweight) had an RDI 5 after surgery 
and 2 of these children had an RDI 30. None of the 
children in group 2 (normal weight) had an RDI 30 
after surgery.

OSA-18 total and domain scores before and after 
adenotonsillectomy for severe obstructive sleep 
apnea are presented in Table 2. The total OSA-18 
score and the scores for all domains showed 
improvement after surgery. The mean total OSA18 
score before surgery was 77.6 and after surgery 
was 33.2. The SRM for the difference in total score 
was 2.2. The domain with the greatest change in 
mean score was sleep disturbance (SRM 2.0). The 
second greatest mean change was in the domain of 
caregiver concerns (SRM 1.9). The smallest mean 
change was in the domain of emotional distress 
(SRM 0.9). These differences in pre-and post-operative 
OSA-18 total scores and domain scores are 
significant (P < 
.0001). 

4. Discussion 
The results of the present study agree with the 
previous findings of Suen et al. [8] who reported 
on 26 children with OSA. These children underwent 
adenotonsillectomy and had pre-and post-operative 
PSG. The mean pre-operative RDI was 16.4 and 
the mean post-operative RDI was 1.7. All 26 children 
had a lower RDI after adenotonsillectomy. However, 
four children had a post-operative RDI that 
was greater than five indicating persistent OSA. All 
children with persistent OSA had a pre-operative 
RDI greater than 19. 

In the present study of 29 children with severe 
OSA, the mean pre-operative RDI was 63.9 and the 
mean post-operative RDI was 14.2. Only nine children 
(31%) had resolution of OSA as measured by a 
post-operative RDI of less than 5. Therefore, a high 
pre-operative RDI in children with OSA is associated 
with a reduced likelihood of resolution of the disorder 
after adenotonsillectomy. These findings 
imply that children with severe OSA should have 
routine post-operative PSG to identify persistent 
OSA that may require additional therapy.

There are no absolute guidelines based on PSG in 
combination with clinical signs and symptoms to 
diagnose severe OSA in children [7]. McColley et 
al. [6] found that children who had a respiratory 
complication after adenotonsillectomy, indicating 
severe OSA, all had a pre-operative RDI greater than 

10. Suen et al. [8] as noted above, found that 
children with a pre-operative RDI greater than 19 
were less likely to have resolution of OSA after 
adenotonsillectomy, also an indication of severe 
OSA. Finally, Rosen et al. [16] found that children 
who had respiratory complications after adenotonsillectomy 
all had a pre-operative RDI greater than 
40 and a minimum arterial O2 saturation less than 
70% indicating severe OSA. Given that a variety of 
standards exist for the identification of severe OSA 
on the basis of PSG ranging from an RDI of 10 to 40, 
[6,8,16] a pre-operative RDI greater than 30 was 
used in the present study to identify severe OSA. 
Goldstein et al. [9] and Mitchell et al. [10] 
reported improvements in quality of life after adenotonsillectomy 
in the general population of children 
with OSA within 6 months of surgery. In the 
present study, caregivers reported improvement in 
their children after surgery in all domains of the 
OSA-18 survey including sleep disturbance, physical 
suffering, emotional distress and daytime problems. 
Caregiver’s concerns were also reduced 
after surgery. Thus, we conclude that the dramatic 
improvement in quality of life seen after adenotonsillectomy 
for OSA in the general population of 
children also occurs in children with severe OSA 
and that this improvement persists for at least 4 
months after surgery. 

This study has several limitations. It was not 
possible to have a control group of children with 
severe OSA who did not undergo surgery. In view of 
the difficulty of obtaining both pre-and post-operative 
PSG, it was not feasible to have a sample size 
large enough to compare the effects of different 
comorbidities, gender or age on the degree of 
improvement after adenotonsillectomy for severe 
OSA. Furthermore, the follow-up was relatively 
short and it is not known whether improvements 
are maintained long-term. In spite of these limitations, 
the present study shows that children do 
improve markedly after adenotonsillectomy for 
severe OSA, but the majority have persistent symptoms 
of the disorder. 

5. Conclusion 
Children with severe OSA who undergo adenotonsillectomy 
show a significant improvement in RDI 
and in quality of life over a period of several months 


Outcome of adenotonsillectomy for severe obstructive sleep apnea in children 

after surgery. However, OSA does not resolve in the 
majority of these children. Therefore, to identify 
those who may require additional therapy, postoperative 
PSG is recommended for all children with 
severe OSA.
