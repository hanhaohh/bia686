We tested the hypothesis that pharyngeal geometry and soft 
tissue dimensions correlate with the severity of sleep-disordered 
breathing. Magnetic resonance images of the pharynx 
were obtained in 18 awake children, 7–12 yr of age, with 
obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (OAHI) values ranging 
from 1.81 to 24.2 events/h. Subjects were divided into low-
OAHI (n . 
9) and high-OAHI (n . 
9) groups [2.8 . 
0.7 and 

13.5 . 
4.9 (SD) P . 
0.001]. The OAHI correlated positively 
with the size of the tonsils (r2 . 
0.42, P . 
0.024) and soft 
palate (r2 . 
0.33, P . 
0.049) and inversely with the volume 
of the oropharyx (r2 . 
0.42, P . 
0.038). The narrowest point 
in the pharyngeal airway was smaller in the high-compared 
with the low-OAHI group (4.4 . 
1.2 vs. 6.0 . 
1.3 mm; P . 
0.024), and this point was in the retropalatal airway in all 
but two subjects. The airway cross-sectional area (CSA)airway 
length relation showed that the high-OAHI group had 
a narrower retropapatal airway than the low-OAHI group, 
particularly in the retropalatal region where the soft palate, 
adenoids, and tonsils overlap (P . 
0.001). The “retropalatal 
air space,” which we defined as the ratio of the retropalatal 
airway CSA to the CSA of the soft palate, correlated inversely 
with the OAHI (r2 . 
0.49, P . 
0.001). We conclude that 7-to 
12-yr-old children with a narrow retropalatal air space have 
significantly more apneas and hypopneas during sleep compared 
with children with relatively unobstructed retropalatal 
airways.

THE PREVALENCE OF SLEEP-DISORDERED breathing (SDB) in 
children is 2% (16). Emerging evidence suggests that, 
unlike adults, some children with SDB exhibit hyperactivity 
instead of daytime sleepiness, and they may 
have poor school performance and/or cognitive abnormalities 
(10, 13). Given the estimated prevalence of 
SDB in children and its potential clinical impact, a 
better understanding of the mechanisms underlying its 
development is important. 

Both anatomic and neuromuscular control mechanisms 
appear to contribute to SDB in adults (27), and

recent studies suggest that this is also true in children 
(16, 17). However, the relationships among pharyngeal 
geometry and soft tissue anatomy and the severity of 
SDB in children are complex and remain incompletely 
defined. A recent study evaluating pharyngeal geometry 
and soft tissue anatomy with magnetic resonance 
(MR) imaging (MRI) in a group of young children (4–5 
yr old) found that children with SDB had smaller 
pharyngeal airways and enlarged tonsils, soft palates, 
and adenoids but no differences in craniofacial bony 
anatomy compared with controls (5). The subjects studied 
by Arens et al. (5) had a mean age of 4.8 yr. 
Although the ratio of pharyngeal soft tissue size to 
craniofacial dimensions does not change significantly 
over the first 11 yr (3), subtle abnormalities in craniofacial 
dimensions, the size of pharyngeal soft tissues, 
or the ratio of soft tissue structures to craniofacial 
dimensions may exist in children with SDB. Thus it is 
important to study the relation between pharyngeal 
airway size and soft tissue anatomy and the severity of 
SDB during development. 

Another factor that could confound the interpretation 
of previous studies is the use of sedation to obtain 
MRI studies in young children. Because barbiturates 
depress the activity of upper airway muscles much 
more than the activity of the diaphragm in both human 

(8) and animal subjects (12), the pharynx of a sedated 
individual is susceptible to narrowing, because the 
flaccid pharyngeal muscles may not adequately counterbalance 
the inspiratory collapsing pressures produced 
by the diaphragm. This mechanism may lead 
to overestimation of the degree of airway narrowing 
on MRI. 
Accordingly, our major goal was to obtain upper 
airway MR images from a group of children, aged 7–12 
yr, with sleep-related respiratory disturbances of varying 
severity so that we could test the hypothesis that 
pharyngeal geometry and/or soft tissue dimensions 
correlates with the severity of SDB. To avoid the potentially 
confounding influences of sedation, MR images 
were obtained in awake, nonsedated children.

PHARYNGEAL GEOMETRY AND SLEEP-DISORDERED BREATHING 

2031 

METHODS 

Subjects. All methods used to recruit subjects and to collect 
the present data set were approved both by the University of 
Arizona Human Subjects Committee and the Tucson Unified 
School District Research Committee. In all cases, we obtained 
written, informed consent from the parents and assent 
from the children. Eighteen children aged 7–12 yr participated 
in the present experiments. The subjects were 
drawn from a pool of Hispanic and Caucasian children participating 
in the Tucson Children’s Assessment Of Apnea 
Study (TuCASA), as described in detail previously (9, 10). In 
an earlier study (unpublished observations), we examined 
the chemoreceptor responses of 50 children from a sample of 

240 children who previously had an unattended home polysomnogram 
performed. We chose these 50 subjects by randomly 
selecting children with RDI values of 5or 5. We 
recruited the first 25 subjects in each of the two RDI ranges 
who responded to our request. For the present study, we 
selected a subset of these 50 children by randomly choosing 
10 subjects with RDI values of 5 and 10 subjects with 
values of 5. All 20 of the randomly selected subjects agreed 
to participate, although one subject from each group failed to 
show up for their scheduled experiment, leaving us with a 
final sample of 18 subjects (Table 1). It is important to point 
out that our subject group is representative of the group as a 
whole with regard to age and anthropometric distribution, 
although by design we excluded subjects that had RDI values 
between 5 and 10. Also note that we corrected the BMI values 
for age, sex, and ethnicity (21), and we report the resulting 
body mass index (BMI) percentile values in Table 1. Of the 18 
subjects selected for study, 4 snored, and 3 of those 4 also had 
witnessed apnea. Four other subjects had excessive daytime 
sleepiness, and two of those also snored. All subjects with 
symptoms were in the high-obstructive apnea-hypopnea 
(OAHI) group. 
Polysomnography. Subjects underwent unattended home 
polysomnography (9) using the Compumedics PS-2 system 
(Abbotsford, Victoria, Australia). The following signals were 
obtained: C3/A2 and C4/A1 electroencephalogram, right and 
left electrooculogram, a bipolar submental electromyogram, 

Table 1. Subject characteristics 

thoracic and abdominal displacement (inductive plethysmography 
bands), airflow (nasal-oral thermocouple), nasal pressure, 
electrocardiogram (single bipolar lead), snoring (microphone 
attached to a vest), body position (Hg gauge sensor), 
pulse oximetry (Nonin, Plymouth, MN), and ambient light 
(sensor attached to the vest to detect lights on or off). With 
the use of Compumedics W-Series Replay (version 2.0, release 
22), sleep stages were scored according to standard 
criteria (19). The respiratory disturbance index (RDI) was 
defined as the number of respiratory events (apneas and 
hypopneas) per hour of the total sleep time irrespective of 
any associated oxygen desaturation or arousal. Polysomnograms 
with 4 h of scorable oximetry were classified as failed 
studies and were repeated if the participant consented. 

Although the oximeter pulse waveform was not recorded 
during acquisition of the polysomnography data, the Compumedics 
data-acquisition software contains artifact-rejection 
algorithms. These are noted in the computer-assisted scoring. 
In addition, because the records were hand scored by the 
technician, the oximetry signal was inspected for evidence of 
artifact. Desaturation artifact induced by motion is generally 
easily recognizable and was excluded if it occurred. Apneas 
were scored if the peak-to-trough amplitude of the airflow 
signal using the thermistor decreased below at least 25% of 
the amplitude of “baseline” breathing and if this change 
lasted for 6 s or two breath cycles. Central apneas were 
scored if both airflow and thoracoabdominal effort were absent. 
However, central events that occurred after movement 
were not included. Obstructive apneas were identified if the 
airflow signal decreased to below 25% of the “baseline amplitude,” 
but with continued thoracoabdominal effort. Hypopneas 
were scored if the magnitude of any ventilation signal 
decreased below 70% of the baseline amplitude. Although 
the polysomnographic montage included monitoring of nasal 
pressure, we elected not to use this parameter to identify 
SDB events because experience with this technique in children 
is quite limited. In addition, some children were unable 
to tolerate wearing the nasal cannula so that scorable data 
were not available for all of the subjects.

PHARYNGEAL GEOMETRY AND SLEEP-DISORDERED BREATHING 

The RDI that we routinely compute includes central apneas 
as well as obstructive apneas and hypopneas (9, 10). On 
the basis of the clinical and physiological uncertainty of 
central apneas in children (16), we subtracted central events 
from the RDI to derive the OAHI. In our subjects, this index 
represents primarily hypopneas, because only 13 of the subjects 
showed frank obstructive events during their sleep 
study. The number of frank obstructive events ranged from 

0.1 to 0.8 per hour, except for one subject who averaged 7 
obstructions per hour. 
Airway imaging. Participants were studied between 9:00 
AM and 2:00 PM, and they arrived at the MRI facility 1h 
before the time of their scheduled experiment. Subjects were 
studied in the supine position in the bore of a General 
Electric 0.5-T MRI instrument and were imaged with the use 
of a standard head coil. The instrument error is 0.5 mm, or 
0.5% when calibrated with a 100-mm phantom. After subjects 
were positioned in the machine, scout images were 
obtained to confirm and adjust positioning so that the entire 
pharynx was clearly visible. Axial images were obtained from 
just above the orbital cavity to just below the larynx. Sagittal 
images were obtained from the midline to the ears bilaterally. 
To highlight the air spaces, longitudinal relaxation time 
(T1)-weighted axial and sagittal spin-echo images [repetition 
time (TR) . 
500 ms; echo time (TE) . 
11 ms] were obtained 
in two separate series. To highlight the pharyngeal soft 
tissues, we then ran a third sequence consisting of transverse 
relaxation time (T2)-weighted sagittal fast spin-echo images 
(TR . 
3,500 ms; effective TE . 
85 ms, and excitation train 
length . 
8). Data and image matrices were 256 . 
256, the 
slice thickness was 4 mm with a 1-mm skip, and the field of 
view was 22 cm in all three sequences. A bandwidth of 10.7 
kHz and two averages (2 NEX) were used in all three sequences. 
Each imaging sequence required 4 min to complete, 
and because the children were not sedated they were 
instructed to remain perfectly still until the scan was completed. 
Children could view the investigators through a mirror, 
and could communicate via headphones and a microphone. 
The children were allowed a few minutes to move 
their arms and legs in between each of the three scans. 
Preliminary studies indicated that the time required to complete 
these three scans was the maximum tolerable given the 
age of the children and the rigid requirements for subject 
compliance. 

Image analysis. Image analysis was performed on an IBM 
personal computer using SCION image software (formerly 
NIH Image), which allows manual tracing of regions and 
structures of interest. This software computes the minimal 
and maximal pixel values of 16-bit images and uses the 
result to linearly scale the data to 8 bits. Because air-filled 
spaces are black on MRI, we used a threshold method to 
differentiate the oropharyngeal airway from surrounding 
tissue, as previously described (6). From a representative 
sample of axial images, we obtained the minimum, the maximum, 
and the SD of the pixel values from regions of the 
black space at the outer boundary of the image. The SD of the 
black space was used as an estimate of noise in the image (6). 
The average threshold value plus one SD served as the 
threshold value for differentiating true black space (airway) 
from surrounding tissue. Bony and soft tissues were analyzed 
by using standard radiologic landmarks. 

T1-weighted axial slices were used to measure the cross-
sectional area (CSA) of the tonsils at their widest point, the 
pharyngeal fat pad CSA, and the intermandibular distance. 
Midline T1-weighted sagittal slices were used to obtain the 
CSA of nasopharynx. T2-weighted sagittal images were used 
to obtain the CSA of the soft palate and adenoids. We ob


tained the volume of the oropharynx by measuring the CSA 
of each relevant axial slice and multiplying the CSA by the 
slice thickness to obtain a volume for each slice. The volume 
measures of each sequential slice in a given region were then 
summed to obtain the regional volume. Each axial slice was 
separated by a 1-mm “skip,” and we cannot measure the CSA 
of the skipped regions. Therefore, our estimates of regional 
volumes will be slightly underestimated. However, because 
the 1-mm skip was constant in all imaging sequences and in 
all subjects, the omission of these small skipped slices will 
not influence relative differences in the volume of the airway 
or the volume of pharyngeal structures. The volume of the 
adenoids was obtained by the same method using adjacent, 
T2-weighted sagittal slices. 

Boundaries defining the oropharynx included the tongue 
or soft palate anteriorly, the pharyngeal constrictor muscle 
posteriorly, and the pharyngeal tonsils laterally. A horizontal 
line extending from the junction of the hard and soft palate to 
the posterior wall of the pharynx defined the rostral limit of 
the oropharynx, and the tip of the epiglottis defined the 
caudal margin (Ref. 18, and see Fig. 1). Nasopharyngeal CSA 
was estimated from a midline sagittal slice, and defined as 
the entire airspace rostral to the horizontal line extending 
from the junction of the hard and soft palate to the posterior 
pharyngeal wall (Fig. 1). The retropalatal airway was defined 
as that part of the oropharynx bounded rostrally by a horizontal 
line extending from the junction of the hard and soft 
palate to the posterior pharyngeal wall, anteriorly by the 
body of the soft palate, posteriorly by the posterior pharyngeal 
wall, and caudally by the tip of the soft palate (i.e., 
between the top and middle horizontal lines in Fig. 1). Two 
different individuals who were trained to use the imaging 
software analyzed the images. It was not possible to obtain 
measurements of every variable in every subject because in 
some cases the boundaries of structures of interest could not 
be clearly defined. This was generally the result of image 
blurring caused by movement artifact in the nonsedated 
subjects. 

Data analysis. We first divided the subjects into two 
groups, one with high (7) and one with low (4) OAHI 
values (Tables 1 and 2). We used ANOVA (Sigma Stat 3.0) 
followed by the Student-Neuman-Keuls post hoc procedure to 
determine which variables were significantly different between 
the two groups, with a post hoc P value of 0.05 
considered significant. If a given variable showed a significant 
group difference, we then examined the relation between 
that variable and the OAHI (dependent variable) by 
using linear regression analysis. This allowed us to test the 
hypothesis that a given variable correlated with the severity 
of SDB. We used a simple linear regression model followed by 
ANOVA (Sigma Stat 3.0), with significance defined as a P 
value of 0.05. We also computed the “retropalatal air 
space,” which we defined as the ratio of the CSA of the 
retropalatal airway to the CSA of the soft palate, by using 
midline sagittal images for analysis. This index provides a 
simple estimate of the size of the retropalatal airway relative 
to the size of the adjacent soft palate; values below 1.0 
indicate that the CSA of the soft palate is larger than the 
CSA of the retropalatal airway.

and the sleep time and minimum arterial O2 saturation 
obtained during home polysomnography. We also 
conducted correlation analyses between each of the 
variables that we measured and the BMI percentile 
and failed to find any significant relationships, suggesting 
that the BMI percentile alone cannot explain 
variability in the OAHI, pharyngeal airway dimensions, 
or soft tissue anatomy. The high-OAHI group 
was significantly taller than the low-OAHI group. 
However, of all pharyngeal variables measured, only 
the CSA of the soft palate correlated significantly with 
height (r2 . 
0.46, P . 
0.016, see DISCUSSION). The OAHI 
and RDI values of the two groups were well separated 
and significantly different (Table 2). Intermandibular 
distance averaged 72.5 . 
3.2 mm in the low-OAHI 
group and 73.0 .

The CSAs of the tonsils and soft palate were significantly 
larger in the high-compared with the low-
OAHI group (Table 3, Fig. 2). Although there was a 
trend toward a larger adenoid volume and pharyngeal 
fat pad CSA in the high-OAHI group, the differences 
were not significant (Table 3). The correlation between 
the OAHI and the CSA of the soft palate and tonsils is 
shown in Fig. 3. Both tonsil and soft palate CSA cor-

and 39% of the variability in the OAHI, respectively. 
As shown in Table 3, significant differences between 
the high-and low-OAHI groups were found for the sum 
of tonsil and soft palate CSA (P . 
0.001), tonsil plus 
adenoid CSA (P . 
0.016), and the sum of tonsil, adenoid, 
and soft palate CSA (P . 
0.005). Correlation 
analyses of these combined soft tissue masses with the 
OAHI revealed significance for the sum of the tonsil 
and soft palate CSA vs. the OAHI (r2 . 
0.50, P . 
0.011) 
but not for the tonsil plus adenoid CSA or for the tonsil 
plus adenoid plus soft palate CSA. However, we did not 
have all soft tissue masses in all subjects, resulting in 
a diminution of our sample size for the latter two 
measures by seven and six subjects, respectively; this 
weakened our statistical power (see DISCUSSION). 

We used multiple linear regression analysis to predict 
the percentage of the variance in the OAHI that 
could be predicted by knowledge of the size of soft 
tissue structures. We included in our analysis soft 
palate, tonsils, adenoids, and fat pad areas, although 
we were able to use a maximum of three variables in 
the model, given the available sample size. The CSA of 
the tonsils and soft palate could explain 74.3% of the 
variance in OAHI, but addition of fat pad area and/or 
adenoid area reduced the predictive power. 

Analysis of pharyngeal airway dimensions did not 
reveal differences in the CSA of the retropalatal or 
nasopharyngeal air spaces (Table 4) but did show that 
the volume of the oropharynx was smaller in the high-
compared with the low-OAHI group (P . 
0.001). We 
also found a significant correlation between the OAHI 
and the oropharyngeal volume (Fig. 4A). This led us to 
examine other oropharyngeal dimensions, including 
the oropharyngeal length, the smallest anteroposterior 
(AP) and lateral diameters, and the elliptical ratio 
(lateral diameter/AP diameter). We found no group 
differences for any of these variables. We also determined 
the smallest oropharyngeal diameter, whether 
it was in the lateral or AP plane, in each subject. This 
analysis did show that the narrowest diameter mea-

high OAHI values is significantly narrower where the 
adenoids, tonsils, and soft palate overlap; and the 
OAHI is inversely and significantly related to the size 
of the retropalatal air space. 

Critique of methods. On the basis of the clinical 
uncertainty of central apneas in children (16), we subtracted 
central events from the RDI to derive an “obstructive 
apnea-hypopnea index,” or OAHI. In our subjects, 
this index represents primarily hypopneas, because 
only seven of the subjects showed frank 
obstructive events during their sleep study. We ac-

knowledge that our definition of hypopnea did not 
incorporate an arousal or desaturation criteria. Although 
such criteria have been recommended (1), more 
recent reviews have noted that there is no standard 
definition of hypopnea in children (2, 22). Recently, our 
laboratory has demonstrated that, using our present 
definition, there is an association between RDI and 
several clinical outcomes in children (11). We also wish 
to emphasize that the definition of hypopnea employed 
in this study was used to describe a spectrum of SDB 
ranging from none or mild to severe and not to implicate 
a specific value as constituting disease. Thus the 
precise definition utilized is not important if it provides 
a relatively consistent description of SDB severity. To 
demonstrate that this is true in the present study, we 
have performed a correlation matrix using the hypopnea 
definition employed in our study and others that 
required an oxygen desaturation event of 2–4%. These 
indexes were highly intercorrelated with r . 
0.82– 
0.95, indicating that the use of a different event definition 
would only change the absolute values of the 
OAHI and would not alter any assessment of relative 
disease severity in these children. 

We did not have a true control group composed of 
children with a total absence of respiratory disturbances 
during sleep. Nevertheless, our decision to classify 
children with an OAHI was not arbitrary. Data 
from TuCASA indicate that children with a RDI of 5 
have a higher prevalence of learning problems and 
excessive daytime sleepiness (10) as well as an impairment 
in learning on neurocognitive testing (13). Furthermore, 
there is little available information on the 
prevalence of hypopneas in children (16), although our 

average OAHI value for the high-OAHI group (13.5) is 
slightly higher than that reported by Arens et al. (5) in 
4-yr-old children with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). 
Our low-OAHI group had an average of 2.8 events per 
hour, which was markedly and significantly lower than 
the high-OAHI group. Moreover, our subjects had a 
wide range of OAHI values, and the major goal of the 
study was to determine the relation between the severity 
of OSA and pharyngeal airway anatomy. 

We chose not to sedate the subjects for the imaging 
protocol because of the more profound depression by 
sedatives of upper airway compared with respiratory 
pumping muscles in human (8) and animal (12) models. 
However, the imaging sequences that we used 
required up to 4 min to complete, and if the child 
happened to move during this time some or all of the 
image would be blurred by the motion artifact, reducing 
the image quality significantly. We spent considerable 
time explaining the importance of staying still to 
the children, and we gave them opportunities to move 
their arms and legs in between each of the imaging 
sequences. Nevertheless, we do not have anatomic data 
for every variable in each subject because of motion 
artifact, and this reduced our sample size and statistical 
power for some of the measurements (see METHODS). 
We were willing to accept the smaller sample size for 
some variables as a trade-off for obtaining data in 
nonsedated subjects, and we believe that the resulting 
data set is fairly representative of the target population. 


Pharyngeal soft tissue anatomy. We found significant 
correlations between the OAHI and the size of the soft 
palate. We also demonstrated that the soft palate relative 
to the size of the retropalatal airway (the retropalatal 
air space) is significantly larger in subjects 
with high OAHI values, leading to a rather strong and 
statistically significant correlation between the OAHI 
and the retropalatal air space. Arens et al. (5) also 
found a significantly larger soft palate CSA in a group 
of younger children (average age 4 yr) with SDB 
compared with normal control subjects. The large soft 
palate in the high-OAHI subjects is consistent with

recent studies in adults with OSA. Thus Malhotra et 
al. (15) showed that men had significantly larger soft 
palates than age-and BMI-matched women, and 
Ciscar et al. (7) also showed that adults with SDB had 
significantly larger soft palates than disease-free 
adults. It is of interest that our high-OAHI group was 
also taller than the low-OAHI group and that of all 
measured variables the soft palate CSA was the only 
one that correlated significantly with height. Perhaps 
rapid growth in general is associated with relatively 
rapid growth of the soft palate relative to growth of the 
retropalatal airway. Our measurements of the retropalatal 
air space and its strong inverse correlation with 
the OAHI are consistent with this hypothesis. 

We also found a significant correlation between the 
OAHI and the size of the tonsils but not the adenoids. 
Although we did show a significant difference in combined 
tonsil and adenoid CSA in the high-and low-
OAHI groups, the relation between tonsil plus adenoid 
CSA and the OAHI was not statistically significant. 
Arens et al. (5) also measured the difference in combined 
tonsil plus adenoid volume in their 4-yr-old patients 
and their age-matched control subjects and 
found that this value correlated significantly with the 
apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) (r2 . 
0.26). Both tonsils 
and adenoids grow very rapidly between age 4 and 8 yr, 
with slower growth of craniofacial bony structures (16). 
As a result, the tonsils and adenoids are large relative 
to the upper airway, resulting in a narrowed pharynx. 
The subjects in the study of Arens et al. were at an age 
where large tonsils and adenoids are expected, so it is 
remarkable that the subjects with sleep apnea had 
even larger tonsils and adenoids than the age-matched 
control subjects (5). This observation underscores the 
profound importance of pharyngeal soft tissue structures 
as one of the underlying causes of SDB in children. 
However, the pharyngeal soft tissue mass that 
has the most dominant effect on pharyngeal obstruction 
and the severity of the underlying pathology may 
change with age. 

We also failed to show a significant correlation between 
the OAHI and the size of the parapharyngeal fat 
pad. Arens et al. (5) also failed to show a larger fat pad 
volume in the SDB group compared with the control 
group. Thus fatty deposits in the pharyngeal walls do 
not appear to be a significant problem in most children 
with SDB, although the size of the pharyngeal fat pad 
certainly contributes to airway obstruction in adults (7, 
23–25). The present results extend the work of Arens 
et al. (5) by demonstrating that the severity of sleep-
disordered breathing correlates significantly with the 
size of the tonsils and soft palate, and that this is true 
across an age spectrum where the size of pharyngeal 
soft tissues relative to pharyngeal volume normally 
declines. 

Pharyngeal geometry. The oropharyngeal volume of 
our high-OAHI subjects was 39% smaller than the 
volume measured in the low-OAHI group. In addition, 
oropharyngeal volume correlated significantly with the 
OAHI. Arens et al. (5) found the pharynx to be 40% 
smaller in the children with SDB, a difference that is in 

substantial agreement with the present observations. 
However, they did not find a significant correlation 
between airway volume and the AHI in their subjects. 
It is possible that their inclusion of central events in 
the computation of the AHI weakened the relationship 
between this index and the pharyngeal anatomy because 
central apneic events are very common in children 
with no pharyngeal abnormalities or sleep-related 
breathing disturbances (16). 

We also measured the narrowest AP and lateral 
diameter of axial airway slices in all subjects, as well 
as the ratio of the lateral to AP diameter (the elliptical 
ratio, an index of airway shape), but found no differences 
in any of these variables between the high-and 
low-OAHI subjects. However, we did find that the 
narrowest airway dimension, measured in either the 
AP or lateral plane, was significantly smaller in the 
high-compared with the low-OAHI subjects. We are 
unaware of similar information in children, and the 
data on airway shape in adults with OSA are equivocal. 
Some studies show that the airway is more elliptical 
in OSA subjects compared with control subjects, 
with the long axis oriented in the AP plane (14, 20). In 
contrast, a more recent study failed to show differences 
in the AP or lateral dimensions of the pharynx between 
OSA subjects and controls, and the study also suggested 
that these dimensions may differ depending on 
whether the subjects are studied while awake or asleep 
and on whether the measurements are made during 
inspiration or expiration (7). The present results in 
awake children show that the oropharyngeal airway of 
children with high OAHI values tends to be narrower 
than that observed in low-OAHI subjects, but the relative 
narrowing in the AP and lateral dimensions appears 
to be more uniform in children compared with 
adults. 

Pharyngeal airway CSA-length relation. We found 
that the high-OAHI group had a significantly narrower 
pharynx in the region where the soft palate, adenoids, 
and tonsils overlap. This region is within the classically 
defined oropharynx [e.g., Gray’s Anatomy (26)] 
but is often termed the velopharynx, the retropalatal 
airway, or the transpalatal airway, among other names 
(18). We have chosen to term this region the retropalatal 
airway because it corresponds to that segment of 
the oropharynx located immediately posterior to the 
soft palate. This appears to be the most common site of 
obstruction in adults with OSA (18). 

The average CSA-length curves for the two groups 
were significantly different by ANOVA, which is consistent 
with our observation of different airway volumes 
in the two groups (i.e., the area under the CSA-
length curve is equivalent to airway volume). These 
observations are in agreement with a more recent 
study by Arens et al. (4), wherein an advanced imaging 
technique known as fuzzy connectedness was used. 
This method allows estimation of the position of the 
airway centerline. This in turn allows better precision 
in aligning each axial slice orthogonal to the airway 
centerline. Although we did not have access to this 
technology, our results are virtually identical to theirs

[please compare our Fig. 5 with Figs. 1 and 2 in Arens 
et al. (4)], except that the adenoids and tonsils occupied 
a much larger fraction of the pharynx in the subjects of 
Arens et al. 

In conclusion, the OAHI in children aged 7–12 yr 
correlates positively with the size of their tonsils and 
soft palate and inversely with the volume of their 
oropharynx. We also found that the retropalatal air 
space is inversely correlated with the OAHI, due 
mainly to abnormally large soft palates relative to the 
size of the retropalatal airway.
