Summary. Aim: Pediatric studies revealed associations of obstructive sleep-disordered 
breathing (SDB) with inflammation, metabolic dysfunction, and elevated blood pressure. Evidence 
about effects of adenotonsillectomy on these abnormalities is scarce. Aim of this investigation was 
to assess changes in C-reactive protein (CRP), circulating intercellular adhesion molecule-1 
(cICAM-1), insulin and blood pressure levels after adenotonsillectomy for SDB in Greek children. 
Methods: Polysomnography was performed pre-and postoperatively in children with SDB and 
controls undergoing adenotonsillectomy for recurrent tonsillitis or otitis. Outcome measures were 
changes in serum markers and blood pressure. Results: Fifty-eight patients (6.2 . 
2.5 years old) 
and 17 controls (6.5 . 
2) were studied. After surgery, apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) decreased 
(mean: 5.9 episodes/hr; 95% confidence interval: 7.8 to 4) in patients. Patients and controls 
were similar regarding outcomes: CRP (0.11 mg/dl [0.25 to 0.02] vs. 0.13 [0.19 to 0.46]; 
P ¼ 
0.11), cICAM-1 (11.6 ng/ml [38.6 to 15.4] vs. 46.6 [101.7 to 8.6]; P ¼ 
0.23), insulin 

(2.49 mU/L [0.32–4.67] vs. 0.16 [2.47 to 2.16]; P ¼ 
0.21), systolic blood pressure index (5.2% 
[2.1–8.3] vs. 10.8 [3.6–17.9]; P ¼ 
0.1) and diastolic blood pressure index (3.2% [7.2 to 0.8] vs. 
2.8 [5.5 to 11.2]; P ¼ 
0.16). Patients with CRP > 
0.3 mg/dl had reduced values after 
AT (P ¼ 
0.003) and those with postoperative AHI . 
1 had a decrease in diastolic blood 
pressure (P ¼ 
0.02). Conclusions: Although adenotonsillectomy improves SDB, it has variable 
effects on inflammatory and metabolic markers or blood pressure. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2008;

INTRODUCTION 

It has been postulated that episodic hypoxemia 
and arousals related to obstructive sleep apnea lead to 
productionofreactiveoxygenspecies1–3 andsympathetic 
nervous system activation4 triggering endothelial dysfunction,
5,6 systemic inflammation,7 insulin resistance,8 
and increased blood pressure.9 Persistence of the above 
abnormalities in untreated subjects may be responsible for 
the increased cardiovascular morbidity reported in adults 
with sleep apnea.10 In children, evidence for the presence 
of chronic inflammation, metabolic dysfunction and 
elevation of blood pressure related to obstructive sleep-
disordered breathing (SDB) is inconclusive. Pediatric 
studies from the United States documented positive 
correlation between C-reactive protein (CRP) and severity 
of sleep apnea,11,12 but this finding was not reproduced 
by two investigations that recruited subjects residing in 
Greece or Australia.13,14 Moreover, a significant association 
was identified between the metabolic syndrome or 
insulin resistance and sleep apnea inadolescents,15–18 but 
two reports in younger individuals several of whom were 
nonobese did not detect correlation of fasting insulin

was not consistently found in all pediatric reports.21

Discrepancies in results of published investigations 
could be attributed to genetic and environmental differences 
between recruited groups of children.22 Even in 
adults, not all studies have confirmed that obstructive 
sleep apnea is related to higher levels of CRP or to 
insulin resistance.23,24 Interventional investigations may 
be helpful in exploring whether a causal association exists 
between intermittent upper airway obstruction during 
sleep and chronic inflammation, endothelial activation, 
metabolic abnormalities, or blood pressure. For example, 
treatment of obstructive sleep apnea in adults with 
nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) can 
decrease CRP levels, insulin resistance, and blood 

7,25,26

pressure,although some investigators did not detect 
any beneficial effect of nCPAP.23,27–30 

To our knowledge, few pediatric studies have measured 
fasting insulin and CRP levels in children with obstructive 
SDB before and after adenotonsillectomy.31–33 In one of 
them, CRP levels decreased after surgical resection of 
tonsils and adenoids in 20 children with SDB living in the 
United States but a control group without sleep apnea was 
not recruited for comparison.31 In another report from 
Australia, fasting insulin levels were similar in children 
with resolved and persistent obstructive sleep apnea 
following surgery and in control subjects without apnea.32 
Thus, the aims of the present investigation were: (i) to 
assess the effect of adenoidectomy and/or tonsillectomy 
(AT) on serum markers of inflammation (CRP) and 
endothelial activation (cICAM-1), and on fasting insulin 
levels and blood pressure in a group of Greek children 
with obstructive SDB; (ii) to compare children after 
AT for SDB to control subjects who underwent AT for 
other indications, regarding postoperative changes in 
CRP, cICAM-1, insulin and blood pressure. No previous 
pediatric investigations have explored the effect of AT on 
cICAM-1 concentration or blood pressure levels. 

PATIENTS AND METHODS 

Participants 

Children with SDB who were referred for polysomnography 
by the Otorhinolaryngology Department at Larissa 
University Hospital between January 2004 and December 
2006 were eligible for recruitment. Referral for a sleep 
study was based solely on the availability of appointments 
at the Sleep Disorders Laboratory and not on severity of 
SDB symptoms or on size of tonsils and adenoids.

and throat surgeons also refer patients to the same Sleep 
Disorders Laboratory, which is the only center in Central 
Greece for pediatric sleep studies. After the result of 
polysomnography was available, AT was proposed by 
the ear, nose, and throat surgeon based on the presence 
of: (i) adenotonsillar hypertrophy; (ii) symptoms of 
SDB > 
3 nights/week; and (iii) apnea–hypopnea index 
(AHI) > 
1 episode/hr. During the same time period 
children without symptoms of SDB, who were scheduled 
for AT for recurrent tonsillitis or recurrent otitis media, 
were offered participation to the study as controls. Since 
most of these patients had enlarged tonsils and adenoids, 
diagnosis of unrecognized SDB was one potential benefit 
for children participating in the study. 

Exclusion criteria for both patients and controls were: 

(i) history of cardiovascular, neuromuscular or genetic 
disorders; (ii) previous AT; and (iii) symptoms and signs 
consistent with any acute or chronic inflammatory 
disorder (e.g., acute tonsillitis or otitis media) during 
the preoperative or follow-up evaluation. The study was 
approved by the Institutional Review Board and informed 
consent for postoperative evaluation was obtained from 
parents and child assent from subjects older than 7 years. 
Preoperative Evaluation 

During preoperative evaluation of both patients and 
controls, information about symptoms of SDB and past 
medical history was collected. Somatometrics were 
recorded and body mass index (BMI) z-score was 
calculated.34 Children were obese if BMI z-score was 
over 1.645 (95th percentile for BMI).34 Tonsils and 
adenoids were graded from 0 to 4þ 
(direct inspection and 
trans-oral mirror visualization).35 

Overnight polysomnography was performed under the 
supervision of trained personnel. The Alice 4 computerized 
system (Healthdyne, Marietta, GA) was used to 
record the following parameters: electroencephalogram 
(C3/A2, C4/A1, O1/A2); right and left oculogram; 
submental and tibial electromyogram; body position; 
electrocardiogram; thoracic and abdominal wall motion 
(piezoelectric transducers); oronasal airflow (3-pronged 
thermistor); and oxygen saturation of hemoglobin. Bedtime 
was determined by each child’s routine and 
polysomnography was terminated upon final awakening. 
Arousals and sleep stages were assessed using standard 
criteria.36,37 Obstructive apnea was defined as the presence 
of chest/abdominal wall motion in the absence of 
airflow for at least two breaths in duration.38 Hypopnea 
was: (i) a reduction in the airflow signal amplitude of at 
least 50% compared to baseline; (ii) in the presence of 
chest/abdominal wall motion; and (iii) associated with 
oxygen desaturation of hemoglobin equal to or greater 
than 4% or with an arousal. 

Blood pressure was measured three times (Dinamap 
Pro 100; Critikon, Tampa, FL) using the right arm in the 

Pediatric Pulmonology 


552 Apostolidou et al. 

morning after polysomnography. Prior to the measurement, 
the child was sitting quietly for 5 min, with her back 
supported and the right cubital fossa at the level of the 
heart.39 To control for the effect of age, gender, and height 
on blood pressure an index was calculated: (average 
measured value95th percentile value) . 
100/95th percentile 
value.39 Venipuncture was conducted for routine 
preoperative laboratory tests which included measurement 
of CRP level by a high sensitivity method and serum 
glucose concentration. Part of the obtained serum was 
stored immediately after venipuncture at 708C. 

Postoperative Evaluation 

Children who underwent AT and their parents consented 
for the postoperative evaluation, had a second 
polysomnogram scheduled according to availability of 
appointments at the Sleep Laboratory. Somatometrics and 
blood pressure were measured again, a second morning 
venipuncture was performed and serum was stored at 

708C. CRP and serum glucose concentration were 
measured shortly after venipuncture. Preoperative and 
postoperative cICAM-1 and fasting insulin levels were 
determined later in the stored and frozen serum samples. 
A high sensitivity immunonephelometric method with 
lowest detection limit of 0.0175 mg/dl (N High Sensitivity 
CRP; Dade Behring, Marburg, Germany) was used for 
quantification of CRP levels. Inter-assay coefficients of 
variation were: 3.8% at 0.13 mg/dl, 2.6% at 1.4 mg/dl, and 
5.7% at 5.6 mg/dl. cICAM-1 concentration was measured 
in serum by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for 
quantitative detection of soluble human ICAM-1 (Human 
sICAM-1 ELISA; Bender MedSystems, Vienna, Austria). 
The lowest detection limit of the method was 2.17 ng/ml. 
Insulin values were determined with an electrochemiluminescent 
immunoassay in a Modular E170 analyzer (Roche, 
Mannheim, Germany). Serum glucose levels were measured 
in an Olympus AU 600 analyzer (Olympus, Lismeehan, 
Ireland), by standard enzymatic colorimetric procedure. 

Outcome Measures: Changes in CRP, cICAM-1, 
Insulin, HOMA Index, and Blood Pressure 

Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) index was 
equal to: (fasting insulin [mU/L] X fasting glucose [mmol/ 
L])/22.5.40 Changes in CRP, cICAM-1, insulin, and HOMA 
index were defined as: (postoperative valuepreoperative 
value). Blood pressure change was equal to: (postoperative 
blood pressure indexpreoperative blood pressure index). 

Independent Variables of Interest 

Independent variables possibly affecting outcome 
measures were changes in AHI, oxygen desaturation of 
hemoglobin index or oxygen saturation of hemoglobin 
(SpO2) nadir (postoperative valuepreoperative value) 

and change in BMI z-score (postoperative z-scorepreopreoperative 
z-score). Other independent variables 
were: time between surgery and postoperative evaluation, 
obesity and gender. Long time between AT and follow-up 
evaluation potentially influences postoperative insulin and 
blood pressure values due to the effect of somatic growth. 

Data Analysis 

Three study groups were formed: (i) subjects with AT for 
SDB and postoperative AHI . 
1 episode/hr (complete 
resolution of SDB); (ii) children with AT for SDB and 
postoperative AHI > 
1 episode/hr; and (iii) controls with AT. 
They were compared regarding preoperative characteristics 
and time between AT and second polysomnogram by one-
way analysis of variance (continuous variables) or Chi-
squared test (categorical variables). One-way analysis of 
variance was followed by post hoc tests for pair comparisons 
between groups. Two types of comparisons were completed 
concerning the outcome measures: (i) comparisons of serum 
markers concentrations and blood pressure levels before 
and after AT within each group (paired-samples t test); 

(ii) comparisons between the three study groups regarding 
changes in serum markers and blood pressure after AT (oneway 
analysis of variance and post hoc tests). Stepwise 
multiple linear regression analysis was applied to test the 
independent variables (change in AHI, oxygen desaturation 
of hemoglobin index or SpO2 nadir, change in BMI 
z-score, time between surgery and follow-up, obesity and 
gender) as predictors of the outcome measures. 
Three subgroup comparisons were performed regarding 
postoperative changes of outcome measures: (i) children 
with preoperative AHI > 
5 episodes/hr versus control 
participants; (ii) overweight subjects versus participants 
of normal weight. An additional subgroup comparison 
was carried out specifically for CRP: subjects with SDB 
and preoperative CRP values over 0.3 mg/dl were 
compared with controls. Values higher than 0.3 mg/dl in 
adults predict increased cardiovascular morbidity.41 

Sample Size 

In one pediatric study identifying reduction in a serum 
marker of inflammation after AT,31 mean CRP decreased by 

0.44 mg/dl. The required sample size to detect such mean 
difference in CRP change between children with SDB and 
controls, assuming a standard deviation of 0.21 with 99% 
power at the 1% level is 11 children per group. 
RESULTS 

Subjects’ Characteristics and Polysomnography 
Findings Before and After Surgery 

Figure 1 presents the study profile. Between January 
2004 and December 2006, 117 children with symptoms 
suggestive of obstructive SDB were referred by the 

Pediatric Pulmonology 


Otorhinolaryngology Department for polysomnography. 
Sixty-three of them underwent surgery and 58 were 
recruited to the study in order to undergo the postoperative 
follow-up evaluation. Sixty-five subjects who had AT for 
recurrent episodes of tonsillitis and/or otitis media were 
considered for recruitment as controls and parents of 
17 children consented for participation in the study. 

Subjects’ characteristics, frequency of preoperative 
symptoms and type of surgery are summarized in Table 1, 
and polysomnography indices before and after AT are 
presented in Table 2. Preoperative AHI ranged between 

1.6 and 36.6 episodes/hr in patients and between 0.2 and 
0.9 episodes/hr in control subjects. The three study 
groups were similar regarding age at surgery, female-tomale 
ratio, BMI z-score, proportion of obese participants, 
tonsillar and adenoidal size, type of surgery (adenoidectomy 
or tonsillectomy vs. adenoidectomy and tonsillectomy), 
and time between surgery and follow-up sleep 
study. 
The three study groups did not differ significantly 
relative to the time interval between surgery and follow-up 
polysomnography which ranged from 2 to 14 months 
(Table 1). Apnea–hypopnea index decreased postoper-

atively in the two groups with SDB (P < 
0.05), but not 
in controls (P ¼ 
0.42; Table 2). Similarly, SpO2 nadir 
increased postoperatively in subjects with SDB 
(P < 
0.05), but not in controls (P ¼ 
0.87; Table 2). Oxygen 
desaturation of hemoglobin index decreased in patients 
(P < 
0.001) and slightly increased in the control group 
(P ¼ 
0.03). 

Thirty of 58 (51.7%) children with SDB had 
a preoperative AHI > 
5 episodes/hr that decreased 
postoperatively: from 12.8 . 
7.7 episodes/hr to 2.1 . 


1.6 episodes/hr (P < 
0.001). BMI z-score at follow-up 
increased in patients and controls compared to the 
respective index at the preoperative evaluation 
(P < 
0.05) but these changes were similar in all three 
study groups (P ¼ 
0.39; Table 2). 
Changes in CRP and cICAM-1 

Before AT, subjects with SDB and controls were similar 
in CRP levels (P ¼ 
0.6; Table 3). There was no significant 
change in CRP levels after AT within the SDB or the 
control groups (P > 
0.05; Table 3). Also, the three groups 
were not different regarding CRP concentration change 
after surgery (P ¼ 
0.25; Table 3). 

When only subjects with preoperative AHI > 
5 
episodes/hr were considered (n ¼ 
30), children with 
SDB tended to have more pronounced postoperative 
reduction in CRP compared to controls (P ¼ 
0.07). 
Mean CRP change (95% confidence interval) within the 
subgroup with high AHI was: 0.24 mg/dl (0.49 to 
0.005; P ¼ 
0.06). Children with complete resolution of 
SDB after AT (postoperative AHI . 
1 episode/hr), did not 
have significant reduction in CRP and did not differ 
from controls relative to this outcome measure (P ¼ 
0.32; 
Table 3). Presence or absence of overweight was not 
related to significant postoperative CRP change in 
children with or without complete cure of SDB (P > 
0.05). 

Eight of 58 (13.7%) children with SDB had CRP values 
greater than 0.3 mg/dl preoperatively (mean CRP . 
standard deviation: 1.19 . 
0.63 mg/dl). High CRP values 
of these eight subjects decreased significantly after AT. 
Mean CRP decrease was 1.05 mg/dl (1.6 to 0.5; P ¼ 
0.003). Children with SDB and CRP concentration 
> 
0.3 mg/dl were significantly different from controls 
regarding mean CRP change after AT (P < 
0.001). 

Before AT, there was no difference between patients 
and controls in cICAM-1 levels (P ¼ 
0.74; Table 3). After 
surgery, cICAM-1 levels did not change in either children 
with SDB or in control subjects (P > 
0.05; Table 3). 
Subjects with preoperative AHI > 
5 episodes/hr (n ¼ 
30) 
did not have a significant postoperative reduction in 
cICAM-1 compared to controls (P ¼ 
0.19). Mean cICAM1 
change in the subgroup with high preoperative AHI 
(n ¼ 
30) was 3.4 ng/ml (42.6 to 35.9; P ¼ 
0.86).

(P ¼ 
0.26; Table 3). No significant change in cICAM-1 
was noted in overweight or normal-weight participants 
with or without residual SDB after surgery (P > 
0.05). 

Changes in Insulin and HOMA Index 

Before surgery, the two study groups were similar in 
morning fasting insulin and HOMA index values 
(P ¼ 
0.77 and P ¼ 
0.77, respectively; Table 3). Both 
fasting insulin levels and HOMA index increased postoperatively 
in children with SDB (P < 
0.05), but did not 
change in controls (P ¼ 
0.89 and P ¼ 
0.71, respectively; 
Table 3). The three study groups were not different 
regarding changes of insulin levels and HOMA index after 
surgery (P ¼ 
0.35 and P ¼ 
0.32, respectively; Table 3). 

Children with complete resolution of SDB after AT had 
also a postoperative increase in both insulin levels and 
HOMA index: mean insulin change (95% confidence 
interval) was þ1.08 mU/L (0.02–2.16) and mean 
HOMA index change was þ0.28 (0.06–0.49; P ¼ 
0.04 
and P ¼ 
0.02, respectively). However, the subgroup of 
children with complete resolution of SDB was not 
significantly different from controls regarding changes 
of insulin and HOMA index (P ¼ 
0.66 and P ¼ 
0.61, 
respectively). When only data from subjects with 
preoperative AHI > 
5 episodes/hr (n ¼ 
30) were analyzed, 
both fasting insulin and HOMA index tended to increase 

after AT, but this trend did not achieve statistical 
significance (P ¼ 
0.07 and P ¼ 
0.24, respectively). No 
significant changes of insulin or HOMA index values were 
noted when children with or without residual SDB after 
AT were divided in subgroups according to presence or 
absence of overweight (P > 
0.05). 

Changes in Blood Pressure 

Before AT, the three study groups were similar in 
morning systolic and diastolic blood pressure index 
(P ¼ 
0.48 and P ¼ 
0.67, respectively; Table 3). Systolic 
blood pressure index increased after surgery in controls 
and in children with residual SDB (P < 
0.05; Table 3). 
This increase in systolic blood pressure was significant 
in nonobese subjects with residual SDB (P < 
0.01) but 
not significant in obese participants of the same group 
(P > 
0.05). 

Children with complete resolution of SDB had a 
significant reduction in diastolic blood pressure postoperatively 
(P ¼ 
0.02) and this change tended to be 
significantly different from the respective change in 
controls (P ¼ 
0.07; Table 3). Diastolic blood pressure 
decreased postoperatively in obese children with cure of 
SDB (P ¼ 
0.03) but it did not change in obese participants 
of the same group (P > 
0.05). 

When only subjects with AHI > 
5 episodes/hr were 
considered, there was no significant increase in systolic 
blood pressure index after AT (P ¼ 
0.35). Mean systolic

Summary of Findings and Significant Predictors of 
Postoperative Changes in Outcome Measures 

In summary, after AT in controls, diastolic blood 
pressure and all markers of inflammation and metabolic 
dysfunction remained unchanged while systolic blood 
pressure increased. Time between surgery and follow-up 
evaluation was significant predictor of the systolic blood 
pressure index increase (P ¼ 
0.007). 

After surgery in patients with SDB, fasting insulin and 
HOMA index increased. Systolic blood pressure also 
increased in children with residual SDB after surgery, 
whereas diastolic blood pressure decreased in subjects 
without SDB postoperatively. All other outcome measures 
remained unchanged. Time between surgery and follow-
up evaluation was significant predictor of the systolic 
blood pressure index increase and the diastolic blood 
pressure decrease (P ¼ 
0.03 and P ¼ 
0.029, respectively). 
Changes in AHI, oxygen desaturation of hemoglobin 
index, SpO2 nadir, presence of obesity or BMI z-score did 
not predict the recorded changes in blood pressure, fasting 
insulin and HOMA index after AT. 

When subgroups of children with SDB were analyzed, 
CRP decreased in participants with high preoperative 
values (>0.3 mg/dl). No independent variables predicted 
the observed CRP reduction in subjects with SDB and high 
preoperative CRP level. 

DISCUSSION 

In the present investigation, the effect of AT on a 
number of predictors of future cardiovascular morbidity 
has been evaluated in Greek children with and without 
SDB. It has been proposed that obstructive sleep apnea in 
both childhood and adulthood is causally related to 
systemic inflammation, endothelial activation, metabolic 

–9,11,17,42,43

dysfunction, and blood pressure elevation.5,7If this speculation is valid, then complete resolution of 
sleep apnea after AT in children should be followed by a 
decrease in serum CRP, cICAM-1, insulin, HOMA index, 
and blood pressure. 

We found no significant postoperative CRP concentration 
change in subjects with SDB or in control 
participants. However, a significant CRP decrease was 
noted after AT in the subgroup of children with SDB and 
preoperative levels higher than 0.3 mg/dl. Levels of 
cICAM-1 and insulin did not decrease after surgery in any 
of the study groups, but diastolic blood pressure became 
lower in subjects with complete resolution of SDB 

postoperatively. Overall the results of the current study 
concur with findings of the pediatric report by Waters 
et al.32 in which AT for sleep apnea did not have any effect 
on insulin levels. This study is also in agreement with 
several investigations conducted in sleep apneic adults 
which did not detect beneficial effects of treatment with 
nCPAP on inflammation, metabolic dysfunction and 

–29,44

blood pressure.23,27

It should be noted that absence of end-tidal CO2 and 
nasal pressure monitoring in the present study might have 
not allowed detection of mild SDB among children of the 
control group undergoing AT for recurrent tonsillitis or 
otitis media. Of interest, an association of otitis media with 
increased prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea has been 
reported recently.45 The unstandardized time between AT 
and follow-up polysomnography is a potential study 
limitation. 

Effects on CRP and cICAM-1 

Studies in adults have assessed the potential role of 
inflammation in the association between obstructive sleep 
apnea and cardiovascular disease with conflicting results. 
Some authors have found a positive correlation of CRP 
concentrations with severity of sleep apnea,7,46 while 
other investigators did not reproduce this finding.23,24 

Pediatric studies can be divided in those reporting an 
association between CRP and SDB11,12,47 and others that 
did not find such a relationship.13,14 The former investi


gations11,12,47 

were carried out in children living in the 
United States, whereas the latter13,14 were performed in 
non-US populations (Greece and Australia). 

One recent study by Gozal et al.22 shed some light on the 
yet unresolved issue of inflammation and SDB. It was 
noted that not all studied children with sleep apnea had 
elevated CRP concentrations. CRP levels were higher 
among sleep apneic subjects with altered cognitive 
performance compared to children with sleep apnea and 
normal cognitive scores.22 Children with obstructive 
sleep apnea and no cognitive dysfunction had low mean 
CRP concentrations which were comparable to values in 
controls without SDB (0.21 . 
0.08 vs. 0.18 . 
0.05 mg/dl, 
respectively). It is possible that genetic and environmental 
factors determine subgroups of children within different 
populations with discrepant responses to intermittent 
upper airway obstruction during sleep.22 This interpretation 
is supported by a pediatric study assessing endothelial 
function before and after AT for obstructive sleep apnea.48 
Endothelial function improved in all participants except 
for those with a strong family history of ischemic heart 
disease. 

In the current investigation, no significant postoperative 
decrease in CRP was noted in any of the three study 
groups. In contrast, children with preoperative serum 
CRP > 
0.3 mg/dl—asignificant predictor of cardiovascular 

Pediatric Pulmonology 


morbidity in adulthood41—had significant reduction in this 
outcome measure after AT. This finding is consistent with 
the concept introduced by Gozal and colleagues that there 
are subgroups of children with a more intense inflammatory 
response to obstructive sleep apnea than others. It is likely 
that patients with the most pronounced inflammatory 
response get the most benefitfromAT. In a small 
uncontrolled study, 20 children with obstructive sleep 
apnea and abnormal preoperative CRP levels (0.67 . 


0.21 mg/dl) had lower CRP concentrations postoperatively 
(0.23 . 
0.07 mg/dl).31 Furthermore, in a second uncontrolled 
investigation median CRP decreased from 0.13 to 
0.04 mg/dl in 16 children who had SDB and were treated 
with adenotonsillectomy, noninvasive positive pressure 
ventilation or nasal corticosteroids.33 Finally, AT in 
children with obstructive SDB was associated with a 
decrease of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and an 
increase of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10.49 
Measurement of plasma or serum levels of adhesion 
molecules is one of the methods used in adults with sleep 
apnea to assess endothelial activation.50 Subjects with 
obstructive sleep apnea have higher serum concentrations 
of cICAM-1 and E-selectin than controls50,51 and these 
levels decrease after treatment with nCPAP.50 Morning 
plasma levels of P-selectin-but not of cICAM-1-correlated 
with severity of SDB in children.42 In a second pediatric 
study, there was only a trend for higher overnight change 
in cICAM-1 concentration for subjects with SDB and the 
most severe nocturnal hypoxemia.52 In the present report, 
treatment of obstructive SDB was not accompanied by 
reduced postoperative levels of cICAM-1. It is possible 
that levels of circulating intercellular adhesion molecules 
do not accurately reflect the state of endothelial activation 
in children with sleep apnea. An alternative explanation 
is that children have milder episodes of upper airway 
obstruction and nocturnal hypoxemia compared to 
adults and subsequently minimal degree of endothelial 
activation. 

Effects on Insulin and HOMA Index 

Insulin resistance is defined as decreased responsiveness 
to its metabolic effects. It is a key feature of the metabolic 
syndrome that is characterized by central obesity, glucose 
intolerance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension all of which are 
related to increased risk for cardiovascular disease.53 In a 
recently published study,15 Redline and colleagues reported 
a close association between SDB and the metabolic 
syndrome. The above relationship was confirmed by 
a second study of overweight and obese children and 
adolescents with a mean age of about 11 years.16 It is 
unclear whether the association between SDB and the 
metabolic syndrome is causal. 

Contrary to the results of pediatric studies relating the 
metabolic syndrome to sleep apnea,15,16,54 two published 

Effects of Adenotonsillectomy for Sleep Apnea 557 

pediatric reports did not demonstrate a relationship of 
fasting insulin levels, a surrogate measure of insulin 

SDB.19,20

resistance, with severity of Redline and 
colleagues made the observation that investigations 
supporting a correlation of SDB with insulin resistance 
and the metabolic syndrome recruited predominantly 
adolescents15–18 as opposed to studies with negative 
results that included younger children.19,20 The observation 
by Redline and colleagues is supported by evidence 
indicating that the role of adiposity in the pathogenesis 
of obstructive sleep apnea increases as the child grows 
older.55,56 

In the current study, there was no decrease in fasting 
insulin levels after surgery in patients with SDB or in 
controls. This finding is in complete agreement with the 
results of the published pediatric report by Waters et al.32 
Both the present report and the investigation by Waters 
and colleagues included rather young children (mean age 
at AT: 6.2 . 
2.5 years and 6.9 . 
3.5 years, respectively). 
Moreover, even in adults treatment of sleep apnea with 
nCPAP is not always accompanied by an improvement in 
insulin resistance.23,30 

Effects on Blood Pressure 

Population studies in adults revealed that SDB is 
associated with increased risk for hypertension9 and a 
number of reports showed the beneficial effect of treating 
sleep apnea with nCPAP on blood pressure levels.26,57 Most 
investigations assessing blood pressure levels in children 
with SDB included small numbers of subjects58–60 and 
their main finding was that the higher the severity of SDB, 
the higher the level of systemic arterial pressure although 
not in the hypertensive range. A recent meta-analysis of the 
previous studies found insufficient evidence to support an 
association between SDB and blood pressure.21 

To our knowledge, no previous investigations have 
evaluatedtheeffect ofATas treatmentofobstructiveSDB 
on blood pressure levels. In the current study, surgical 
treatment of sleep apnea reduced diastolic blood pressure 
in the subgroup with complete resolution of SDB. Systolic 
blood pressure increased significantly in controls and 
children with residual SDB after surgery. Time between 
AT and follow-up evaluation was significant predictor of 
this change and thus we speculate that the recorded 
increase in systolic blood pressure was the result of 
increasing age and somatic growth. 

Three factors may explain the absence of a significant 
decrease in blood pressure levels in all participants with 
SDB. First, increasing age is accompanied by somatic 
growth and subsequent increase in blood pressure levels.39 
This increase could potentially overcome the reduction in 
absolute blood pressure values resulting from treatment of 
SDB. Although a blood pressure index was calculated to 
adjust the absolute values for the effect of changing age 

Pediatric Pulmonology 


558 Apostolidou et al. 

and somatic stature, this statistical adjustment can still be 
incomplete. Of note, when children with postoperative 
AHI . 
1 episode/hr were considered, systolic blood 
pressure did not change significantly in patients postoperatively 
whereas it increased in controls. It is possible 
that surgical cure of SDB in this group of patients with 
SDB had a lowering effect on systolic blood pressure 
values which prevented the blood pressure increase 
associated with aging and somatic growth. 

Second, in the current and other studies,61,62 AT was 
inadequate as a treatment method to achieve complete 
cure of SDB and possibly of associated morbidity. In the 
group of patients with postoperative AHI . 
1 episode/hr, a 
reduction in diastolic blood pressure was documented. 
Third, 24-hr ambulatory blood pressure monitoring may 
be a more sensitive method to detect the effects of surgery 
on the cardiovascular system. Measuring only morning 
blood pressure is a potential limitation of the current 
report. 

CONCLUSION 

Although AT ameliorates severity of intermittent upper 
airway obstruction during sleep, it is not always followed 
by dramatic reductions in serum concentrations of 
inflammatory or metabolic markers or a decrease in 
morning blood pressure levels. Children with complete 
cure of SDB after resection of tonsils and adenoids may 
get the most benefit regarding alleviation of cardiovascular 
morbidity related to obstructive sleep apnea.
