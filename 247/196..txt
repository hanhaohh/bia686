Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome analysis in children by Decreases in 
the Amplitude Fluctuations of Pulse Photoplethysmography: role of 
recording duration and Heart Rate Variability. 
Eduardo Gil, Jos´e Mar´ia Vergara, Anna M. Bianchi and Pablo Laguna 
Abstract—Heart rate variability (HRV) during Decreases in 
the Amplitude fluctuations of Pulse Photopletysmography signal 
events (DAP) is studied. The DAP duration and the time span 
of the polysomnography (PSG) recording under study are also 
considered for identification of Obstructive Sleep Apnea events 
in children. Oxygen desaturation is used as reference. The study 
involves recordings of 21 children. 
Periods of time associated with a drop in SaO2 of 3% 
from baseline during at least 5% of the time were labeled as 
pathologic. DAP events were detected using an automatic detector, 
HRV signal processing using the Smooth Pseudo Wigner- 
Ville Distribution was carried out in order to obtain several 
time and frequency HRV indexes. T-test was used to analyze 
differences between groups. The results show discrimination 
power between groups that increases as the duration of the time 
period under analysis, becomes shorter, and so more tune to the 
apneic episodes. Also HRV increase the discrimination power 
helping in discriminating DAP event non related to apnea. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a breathing 
disorder characterised by brief periods of breathing cessation 
during sleep, with recurrent arousals being required 
to reestablish upper airway patency [1]. The prevalence of 
OSAS is estimated as 2% to 3% in children, most of whom 
are undiagnosed and untreated. The associated consequences 
include sleep fragmentation, associated with malfunctioning 
of sleep-related restorative processes, blood gas modifications 
which induce chemical and structural injuries in the 
cells of the central nervous system and it may lead to 
adverse cardiovascular consequences such as myocardial 
infarction and hypertension [2]. Repeated failures related to 
sleep fragmentation at critical stages of development like 
childhood can fundamentally influence a child’s motivation 
and behavior. 
Polysomnography (PSG) is the most commonly used 
diagnostic sleep procedure, but some alternatives to this 
technique have been proposed because of the cost and 
requirement for technical expertise. One alternative to PSG 
is pulse photopletismography signal (PPG) which is a simple

and useful method for measuring the pulsatile component of 
the heartbeat and evaluating peripheral circulation. 
Several studies suggest that when apnea occurs, sympathetic 
activity increases. Hypoxia plays a key role in 
that relationship. The increase in sympathetic activity is 
associated with vasoconstriction and, possibly, is related to 
transient arousal [3]. Vasoconstriction is reflected in the PPG 
signal by a decrease in the fluctuation of the signal amplitude 
[4], [5]. Therefore, the automatic detection of decreases in 
the amplitude fluctuations of PPG (DAP) might be useful 
in indirectly quantifying apneas during sleep [6]. There are 
studies of the diagnosis of OSAS based on the detection 
of vasoconstriction using peripheral arterial tonometry [7], 
which is a similar physiological signal. The relationship 
between autonomic nervous system (ANS) and PPG has been 
the subject of some studies [5], [8]. 
Nevertheless, not all of the DAP events are associated with 
an apnea event [9]. These events may be related to arousals 
not associated with apnea. Some studies [7], [10] include 
HRV as an alternative criteria for discriminating between 
DAP events associated with apnea and those without that 
association, according to [11]. 
The main objective of this study is to assess the potential 
value of DAP events together with HRV in diagnosing 
OSAS. To that end, different DAP events duration and HRV 
parameters have been analyzed for diverse time span of the 
PSG recording under study. 
II. DATA 
This study includes the records of 21 children (11 boys, 10 
girls) whose mean age was 4.47±2.04 (mean±S.D.) years. 
The PSG registers were acquired in Miguel Servet Children’s 
Hospital, Zaragoza, Spain, according to the standard 
methods defined by American Thoracic Society [12], using a 
commercial digital polygraph (EGP800, Bitmed) and recording 
six EEG channels, two electro-oculogram channels, a 
chin electromyogram channel, two ECG channels, air flow 
(oronasal thermocoupler), and respiratory plethysmography, 
with transducers placed around the chest and abdomen. PPG 
and arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) were recorded continuously 
by pulse oximetry (COSMO ETCO2/SpO2 Monitor 
Novametrix, Medical Systems). All of the signals were stored 
at a sampling rate of 100 Hz, except ECG channels whose 
sampling rate was 500 Hz. Only PPG, SaO2 and ECG 
signals were used in the automatic analysis. The PSG data 
were scored manually following standard procedures used

to discriminate children suffering from OSAS (10 children) 
from those who are not (11 children). 
III. METHODS 
A. Classification of different time-span of the PSG recording. 
Complete night PSG recordings were split into segments 
DL corresponding to length L = 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240 
minutes. This fragments and the complete night were classified 
as control, doubt or pathologic based on SaO2 desaturation. 
To establish this classification, a baseline level , 
corresponding to the SaO2 signal mode of the entire night, is 
considered. In all recordings   97% and the probability of 
its value was higher than 0.3 from a bin resolution of 1%. The 
total time intervals that SaO2 signal is below  -3%, t-3, 
was calculated for each fragment in DL. PSG fragments were 
classified according to 
t-3/L < 0.015 control 
0.015< t-3/L < 0.05 doubt 
t-3/L > 0.05 pathologic 
(1) 
This imply a minimum of 5% of the time with evident 
oxygen desaturation to be consider as pathologic, which 
corresponds to a severe OSAS criteria of 20 apneas/hour 
having a mean duration of 10 seconds. For control group the 
threshold corresponds to 5 apneas/hour. This classification 
is the reference used here to assess the utility of DAP and 
HRV for OSAS evaluation in children. Table I shows the 
classification for the different PSG time-span fragments. 
B. DAP events detection 
PPG signal was analyzed using the method described in [6] 
for DAP detection. This detector is based on a preprocessor 
stage which suppress the mean, an envelope detection using 
root mean square technique and a decision rule based on 
an adaptive threshold. The detector also includes an artifact 
detector stage based on Hjorth parameters, see figure 1.

value for discriminate between apneic and non-apneic DAP

Previous to QRS detection, we implemented a preprocessing. 
Nonlinear filtering technique was used for removal of the 
powerline interference [13]. A wavelet-based ECG delineator 
[14] was used for QRS detection. After that, a ECG signal 
spline interpolation around each QRS detection was carried 
out to increase resolution in time of the fiducial point up 
to an equivalent sampling rate of 2000 Hz. An anomalous 
beat exclusion rule [15] was applied in order to determine 
normal beats which were used for the interval tachogram 
generation used in HRV. To analyze the spectral parameters 
of the HRV in a time-frequency plane we used the Smooth 
Pseudo Wigner-Ville Distribution Sx(t, f), since this heart 
rhythm signal is clearly non stationary. This distribution 
is characterized by an independent smoothing, in time and 
frequency, originated by (t) and (

respectively and is defined as:

LF and HF indexes are computed as the power in the LF 
(0.004-0.15 Hz) and HF (0.15-0.5 Hz) bands respectively. 
D. Statistical analysis 
To be sure that HRV measures are robust, only DAP events 
containing a mean of 0.8 normal beats per second within the 
previous to DAP minute and within the subsequent minute 
in the ECG signal were considered. 
The number of DAP events per hour ratio r was obtained 
for each analysis segment DL. From those detected DAP, it 
was excluded the ones which do not satisfy some restrictions 
based on DAP events duration and HRV parameters. 
DAP onset was considered as the time reference for HRV 
analysis. According to [10], two windows, five seconds 
duration each, were defined for each DAP event in order to 
determine changes in ANS: a control window starting at 10 
seconds previous to DAP (Wc) and another window starting 
at 2 seconds after the DAP detection onset (Wd), see Fig. 2.

Mean RR (R R ) and mean low to high frequency ratio 
(LF /H F ) were calculated for each analysis window by 
averaging Sx(t, f) in the time span of each window, and 
then computing the LF and HF indexes, finally the ratios 
between this indexes in Wd and Wc were considered as 
exclusion criteria of the DAP event. Only DAP that fulfills 
the HRV conditions showed in Table II were considered 
in the corresponding DAP per hour ratio r calculation. rRR 
x 
meaning ratio satisfying RR criteria of x% and rLH 
x meaning 
ratio satisfying low to high frequency criteria of x% . 
Depending on DAP events duration 5 different situations 
were considered by restricting to DAP event fulfilling some 
length restrictions: DAP events of any length (G all), shorter 
than 4 seconds (G -4), shorter than 2 seconds (G -2), larger 
than 2 seconds (G +2 ) and larger than 4 seconds (G +4 ). 
A statistical analysis based on Student’s t test was used 
to compare between groups (control, pathologic) for each 
DAP per hour ratio index r (Table II). p values < 0.05 were 
considered statistically significant.

V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 
In our research, we have investigated the value of DAP 
events in conjunction with HRV for OSAS analysis in 
children. To that end, a clinical study have been developed 
for diverse time span of the PSG recordings. Fragments 
of PSG where classified, based on SaO2 desaturation, for 
reference. 
Our results related to DAP events duration showed better 
discrimination between groups for shorter DAP events. This 
result is concordant with the previous study [9]. That might 
imply that many of the larger DAP events are not associated 
with apnea; or even, they could be missed PPG artifacts. 
The best result for discrimination between groups corresponds 
to the rLH 
10 index restricted to DAP duration G -4and 
applied to 15 minutes PSG fragments, resulting in a p value 
of 0.000001. 
Results showed in Fig. 3 and in Fig. 4 indicate that 
discrimination power between groups increases as the PSG 
time-span under analysis becomes shorter, and so more tune 
to the apneic episodes. In general, for pathologic patients, 
larger PSG time-span comprise both oxygen desaturation 
periods related to apneas and normal periods without sleep 
problems making more difficult their classification. 
HRV increase the differentiation power in some cases, 
mainly when large PSG time-span is considered, then helping 
in discriminating DAP event non related to the apneic 
event. This improvement by including HRV analysis is more 
relevant for indexes depending on LF/HF restriction, rLH than 
for those depending on RR restriction, rRR for shorter PSG 
time-span. On the other hand rRR get better results when PPG 
fragments are larger. 
The described method was compared just to oximetry 
which is not sufficiently accurate or validated to recommend 
for use in OSAS diagnosis according to ASDA criteria. 
Nevertheless most of the pathologic fragments corresponds to 
children suffering from OSAS according to clinical diagnosis 
(93% for D15, 98% for D30, 100% for D60, D120, D180, 
D240 and Dall) so the results could be extrapolated from 
oxygen desaturation events to pathological events, at least 
within each record. 
In conclusion the number of DAP events per hour ratio is 
able to classify PSG fragments of children as related to SaO2 
desaturation or normal breathing within a high statistically 
significant probability (p = 0.000001). This discrimination 
between groups is better for shorter PSG time-span and 
the inclusion of HRV analysis improve the results, mainly 
when large PSG time-span is considered which corresponds 
to the situation of more difficult discrimination. The results 
evidence a clear link between oxygen desaturation and DAP 
events presence.
