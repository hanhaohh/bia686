Objective: 
To 
compare 
changes 
in 
behavior 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
in 
children 
with 
either 
mild 
sleep-
disordered 
breathing 
(SDB) 
or 
obstructive 
sleep

(OSA). 


Study 
Design: 
Prospective 
cohort 
study. 


Methods: 
Children 
at 
the 
University 
of 
New 
Mexico 
Children’s 
Hospital, 
Albuquerque 
with 
mild 
SDB 
or 
OSA 
were 
included 
in 
the 
study. 
All 
children 
underwent 
preoperative 
polysomnography 
before 
adenotonsillectomy. 
Mild 
SDB 
was 
defined 
as 
an 
apneahypopnea 
index 
(AHI) 
less 
than 
5 
or 
an 
apnea 
index 
(AI) 
less 
than 
1. 
OSA 
was 
defined 
as 
an 
AHI 
5 
or 
greater 
or 
an 
AI 
1 
or 
greater. 
Pre-and 
postoperative 
scores 
from 
the 
Behavioral 
Assessment 
System 
for 
Children 
(BASC) 
survey 
were 
compared 
using 
repeated 
measures 
analysis 
of 
variance. 


Results: 
The 
mean 
preoperative 
AHI 
for 
children 
with 
mild 
SDB 
(n 
. 
17) 
was 
3.1 
(range, 
1.7–4.7), 
and 
for 
children 
with 
OSA 
(n 
. 
23) 
it 
was 
25.3 
(range, 
10.0 
– 
48.0). 
The 
mean 
preoperative 
BASC 
scores 
for 
children 
with 
mild 
SDB 
were 
not 
significantly 
different 
from 
the 
scores 
for 
children 
with 
OSA. 
The 
demographics 
in 
the 
two 
groups 
of 
children 
were 
similar. 
The 
behavior 
symptom 
index, 
a 
global 
measure 
of 
behavior, 
showed 
significant 
improvement 
after 
surgery 
for 
both 
groups 
of 
children 
(P 
. 
.01). 
Children 
also 
showed 
significant 
improvement 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
in 
the 
BASC 
scales 
of 
atypicality,

INTRODUCTION 


Sleep-disordered 
breathing 
(SDB) 
in 
children 
represents 
a 
spectrum 
of 
disorders 
ranging 
in 
severity 
from 
primary 
snoring 
to 
more 
severe 
forms 
such 
as 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
(OSA).1 
It 
is 
now 
known 
that 
SDB 
is 
associated 
with 
problems 
in 
child 
behavior 
that 
include 
hyperactivity, 
reduced 
attention, 
anxiety, 
depression, 
and 
somatic 
complaints.2 
Adenotonsillectomy, 
the 
primary 
surgical 
treatment 
for 
SDB 
in 
children, 
has 
been 
shown 
to 
lead 
to 
improvements 
in 
respiratory 
parameters 
and 
in 
behavior.3,4 


The 
majority 
of 
children 
who 
undergo 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
SDB 
have 
mild 
forms 
of 
the 
disorder.5 
It 
remains 
unclear, 
however, 
whether 
children 
with 
mild 
SDB 
have 
fewer 
behavioral 
problems 
than 
children 
with 
more 
severe 
forms 
of 
the 
disorder 
such 
as 
OSA. 
Equally, 
it 
is 
unknown 
whether 
surgical 
therapy 
leads 
to 
a 
greater 
improvement 
in 
behavior 
in 
children 
depending 
on 
the 
severity 
of 
preoperative 
SDB. 
This 
issue 
is 
of 
considerable 
clinical 
importance 
because 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
mild 
forms 
of 
SDB 
in 
children 
may 
be 
unwarranted 
in 
some 
instances 
if 
surgery 
does 
not 
resolve 
the 
behavioral 
problems 
that 
are 
the 
principal 
complaint 
of 
caregivers. 


All 
children 
included 
in 
the 
present 
study 
underwent 
full-night 
polysomnography 
to 
establish 
the 
presence 
of 
SDB 
and 
to 
document 
its 
relative 
severity.1 
Child 
behavior 
was 
evaluated 
before 
and 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
using 
the 
Behavioral 
Assessment 
System 
for 
Children 
(BASC).6 
The 
goals 
of 
the 
study 
were 
to 
evaluate 
the 
relationship 
between 
the 
severity 
of 
SDB 
and 
child 
behavior 
and 
to 
compare 
changes 
in 
behavior 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
in 
children 
who 
had 
comparable 
demographics 
but 
different 
severity 
of 
SDB.

MATERIALS 
AND 
METHODS 


Approval 
for 
this 
study 
was 
obtained 
from 
the 
Institutional 
Review 
Board 
of 
the 
University 
of 
New 
Mexico. 
The 
parents 
of 
children 
enrolled 
in 
the 
study 
signed 
an 
informed 
consent 
document. 
Children 
referred 
to 
the 
pediatric 
otolaryngology 
service 
with 
a 
sleep 
disturbance 
who 
were 
considered 
for 
adenotonsillectomy 
underwent 
polysomnography 
and 
were 
included 
in 
the 
study. 
Demographic 
information 
was 
collected 
for 
both 
caregiver 
and 
child. 
Exclusion 
criteria 
included 
1) 
children 
less 
than 
3 
or 
more 
than 
18 
years 
of 
age; 
2) 
children 
who 
previously 
had 
an 
adenotonsillectomy; 
and 
3) 
children 
with 
craniofacial 
syndromes, 
neuromuscular 
disease, 
developmental 
delay, 
or 
those 
receiving 
regular 
medication 
for 
psychiatric 
disorders. 
The 
age-and 
sex-
corrected 
body 
mass 
index 
was 
calculated 
for 
each 
child 
included 
in 
the 
study 
using 
established 
guidelines.7 


All 
study 
participants 
underwent 
polysomnography 
to 
document 
the 
severity 
of 
SDB. 
The 
following 
parameters 
were 
used: 
four-channel 
electroencephalography 
with 
bilateral 
central 
and 
occipital 
leads; 
electro-oculography 
to 
measure 
vertical 
and 
horizontal 
eye 
movements; 
electromyography 
with 
submental 
electrodes; 
electrocardiography; 
airflow 
recording 
through 
the 
nose 
and 
mouth 
by 
a 
nasal 
air 
pressure 
transducer 
with 
end 
tidal 
CO2; 
thoracic 
and 
abdominal 
effort 
by 
piezoelectric 
sensors; 
oxygen 
saturation 
through 
pulse 
oximetry; 
and 
tracheal 
sound 
recording 
using 
a 
microphone 
secured 
to 
the 
neck. 
Digital 
videotaping 
with 
sound 
recording 
was 
performed 
throughout 
the 
night. 
A 
sleep 
medicine 
physician 
interpreted 
the 
polysomnography 
results. 
The 
apnea-hypopnea 
index 
(AHI), 
defined 
as 
the 
average 
number 
of 
obstructive 
apneas 
and 
hypopneas 
per 
hour 
of 
sleep, 
was 
used 
for 
diagnosis 
of 
SDB. 
Obstructive 
apnea 
was 
defined 
as 
total 
absence 
of 
airflow 
through 
the 
mouth 
and 
nose 
with 
continued 
chest 
and 
abdominal 
movement 
for 
at 
least 
two 
respiratory 
cycles. 
Hypopneas 
were 
defined 
as 
a 
decrease 
in 
nasal 
flow 
of 
greater 
than 
50% 
or 
with 
a 
corresponding 
decrease 
in 
oxygen 
saturation 
of 
4% 
or 
less 
or 
with 
an 
arousal.1 
OSA 
was 
defined 
as 
an 
AHI 
5 
or 
greater 
or 
an 
apnea 
index 
(AI) 
1 
or 
greater. 
Mild 
SDB 
was 
defined 
as 
an 
AHI 
1 
or 
greater 
but 
less 
than 
5 
and 
an 
AI 
less 
than 
1. 
Children 
with 
mild 
SDB 
were 
considered 
for 
surgical 
intervention, 
after 
informed 
consent 
was 
obtained, 
when 
the 
caregivers 
reported 
persistence 
or 
worsening 
of 
daytime 
and 
nighttime 
sleep 
symptoms. 
This 
was 
despite 
the 
presence 
of 
only 
a 
mild 
sleep 
disturbance 
on 
polysomnography. 
This 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
practice 
of 
the 
majority 
of 
pediatric 
otolaryngologists.8 
The 
tonsillectomy 
was 
performed 
with 
a 
combination 
of 
sharp 
and 
blunt 
dissection 
using 
primarily 
a 
blade 
electrocautery. 
Adenoidectomy 
was 
performed 
using 
suction 
ablation 
and 
cautery. 


Caregivers 
were 
asked 
to 
complete 
the 
BASC6 
survey 
prior 
to 
surgery 
and 
a 
second 
time 
within 
6 
months 
of 
surgery. 
Specific 
BASC 
instruments 
were 
used 
for 
the 
following 
age 
groups; 
2.5 
to 
5 
years; 
6 
to 
11 
years; 
and 
12 
to 
18 
years. 
The 
BASC 
behavioral 
scales 
are 
aggression, 
anxiety, 
attention 
problems, 
atypicality, 
depression, 
hyperactivity, 
somatization, 
and 
withdrawal. 
BASC 
composite 
scales 
are 
made 
up 
of 
several 
behavioral 
scales 
that 
are 
weighted 
differently 
as 
a 
function 
of 
age. 
This 
weighting 
reflects 
the 
relative 
contribution 
of 
individual 
scales 
to 
problem 
behaviors 
in 
different 
age 
groups. 
The 
composite 
scales 
are 
the 
behavioral 
symptoms 
index 
(BSI), 
externalizing 
problems, 
and 
internalizing 
problems. 
Only 
BASC 
scales 
and 
composites 
that 
were 
applicable 
to 
all 
age 
groups 
were 
included 
in 
this 
study. 
Responses 
to 
each 
question 
were 
scored 
as 
follows: 
never 
occurs 
. 
0; 
sometimes 
occurs 
. 
1; 
often 
occurs 
. 
2; 
almost 
always 
occurs 
. 
3. 
Raw 
scores 
on 
the 
BASC 
scales 
and 
composites 
were 
converted 
to 
T 
scores 
with 
a 
mean 
of 
50 
and 
an 
SD 
of 
10. 
Children 
who 
scored 
from 
60 
to 
69 
were 
considered 
to 
have 
“borderline” 
behavioral 
impairment. 
Children 
who 
scored 
70 
or 
above 
were 
considered 
to 
have 
“clinically 
significant” 
behavioral 
impairment. 


BASC 
T 
scores 
were 
compared 
before 
and 
after 
surgery 
using 
a 
paired 
t 
test. 
A 
P 
value 
less 
than 
or 
equal 
to 
.05 
was 
considered 
significant. 
Children 
were 
also 
divided 
into 
three 
groups 
based 
on 
preoperative 
BASC 
scores: 
normal, 
T 
score 
less 
than 
60; 
borderline, 
T 
score 
greater 
than 
or 
equal 
to 
60 
but 
less 
than 
70; 
and 
clinically 
significant, 
T 
score 
greater 
than 
or 
equal 
to 


70. 
This 
was 
done 
to 
determine 
the 
number 
of 
children 
who 
remained 
borderline 
or 
clinically 
significant 
after 
surgery. 
Preoperative 
and 
postoperative 
BASC 
scores 
for 
each 
group 
of 
children 
(OSA 
and 
mild 
SDB) 
were 
compared 
using 
a 
repeated 
measures 
analysis 
of 
variance. 
Changes 
between 
the 
two 
groups 
were 
compared 
using 
an 
analysis 
of 
covariance 
with 
the 
preoperative 
score 
as 
a 
covariate. 
SAS 
procedures 
(SAS 
Corp., 
Carey, 
NC) 
were 
used 
for 
statistical 
analyses. 
A 
power 
analysis 
indicated 
that 
a 
sample 
size 
of 
15 
was 
adequate 
to 
detect 
a 
10 
point 
difference 
in 
BASC 
T 
scores 
with 
80% 
power 
and 
. 
. 
0.05. 
Because 
a 
difference 
of 
10 
in 
a 
BASC 
T 
score 
is 
clinically 
significant, 
the 
present 
study 
has 
sufficient 
power 
to 
detect 
a 
significant 
change 
in 
behavior 
in 
both 
groups. 


RESULTS 


Forty-six 
children 
were 
included 
in 
the 
study. 
Two 
of 
these 
children 
were 
lost 
to 
follow-up, 
two 
others 
did 
not 
undergo 
adenotonsillectomy, 
and 
the 
caregivers 
for 
two 
children 
did 
not 
complete 
the 
postoperative 
BASC 
survey. 
As 
a 
consequence, 
the 
study 
population 
included 
40 
children, 
17 
with 
mild 
SDB 
and 
23 
with 
OSA. 
The 
demographics 
of 
children 
with 
mild 
SDB 
and 
those 
with 
OSA 
were 
similar 
and 
are 
presented 
in 
Table 
I. 
The 
mean 
AHI 
for 
children 
with 
mild 
SDB 
was 
3.1 
(range, 
1.7–4.7), 
and 
for 
children 
with 
OSA 
it 
was 
25.3 
(range, 
10 
–48). 
The 
follow-up 
period 
lasted 
110 
days 
in 
the 
group 
of 
children 
with 
mild 
SDB 
and 
138 
days 
in 
the 
group 
with 
OSA. 


Mean

scores 
before 
and 
after 
adenotonsillectomy, 
change 
scores, 
and 
confidence 
intervals 
(CI) 
for 
children 
with 
OSA 
and 
for 
children 
with 
mild 
SDB 
are 
presented 
in 
Table 
II. 
Scores 
for 
the 
BSI 
and 
for 
the 
individual 
behavioral 
scales 
atypicality, 
depression, 
hyperactivity, 
and 
somatization 
showed 
significant 
improvement 
after 
surgery 
for 
both 
groups 
of 
children 
(P 
. 
.001). 
The 
mean 
preoperative 
BASC 
scores 
for 
children 
with 
mild 
SDB 
were 
generally 
lower 
than 
for 
children 
with 
OSA, 
but 
these 
differences 
were 
not 
statistically 
significant. 
Similarly, 
the 
mean 
postoperative 
BASC 
scores 
for 
children 
with 
mild 
SDB 
were 
generally 
lower 
than 
for

The 
mean

in 
BSI 
was

(CI, 
3.4–16.6) 
for 
children 
with 
mild 
SDB 
and 
8.2 
(CI, 
3–13.4) 
for 
children 
with 
OSA. 
The 
BASC 
scale 
with 
the 
largest 
mean 
change 
score 
was 
somatization 
both 
for 
children 
with 
mild 
SDB 
and 
for 
children 
with 
OSA. 
The 
domain 
with 
the 
smallest 
mean 
change 
score 
was 
atypicality 
(mean 
change, 
7.2; 
CI, 


1.9–12.5) 
for 
children 
with 
mild 
SDB 
and 
depression 
(mean 
change, 
7.2; 
CI, 
1.4–13) 
for 
children 
with 
OSA. 
The 
differences 
in 
BSI 
and 
BASC 
scales 
for 
the 
two 
groups 
of 
children 
were 
not 
statistically 
significant.

surgery 
was

(41%) 
for 
those 
with

SDB 
and

After

two 
(12%) 
children 
with 
mild

and 
three 
(13%) 
children 
with 
OSA 
had 
BSI 
scores 
that 
indicated 
borderline 
or

significant 
behavioral 
impairment. 


DISCUSSION 


The 
results 
of 
this 
prospective 
study 
suggest 
that 
behavioral 
problems 
associated 
with 
SDB 
are 
not 
related 
in 
a 
simple 
way 
to 
the 
severity 
of 
a 
child’s 
sleep 
disorder. 
All 
40 
children 
included 
in 
the 
present 
study 
underwent 
polysomnography 
to 
document 
the 
severity 
of 
their 
sleep 
disturbance. 
Behavioral 
problems 
associated 
with 
SDB 
were 
evaluated 
by 
caregiver 
proxy 
using 
the 
BASC 
survey 
instrument. 
These 
behavioral 
problems 
include 
atypicality, 
depression, 
hyperactivity, 
and 
somatization 
and 
occur 
regardless 
of 
the 
relative 
severity 
of 
SDB. 
Significant 
improvement 
occurs 
in 
behavioral 
scales 
after 
adenotonsillectomy, 
but 
the 
degree 
of 
improvement 
is 
independent 
of 
the 
severity 
of 
preoperative 
SDB. 


Previous 
studies 
using 
the 
BASC 
behavioral 
instrument4,5 
have 
shown 
that 
children 
with 
OSA 
have 
a 
significant 
improvement 
in 
behavioral 
scales 
after 
adenotonsillectomy. 
The 
BSI, 
a 
total 
behavioral 
score, 
showed 
mild 
to 
severe 
behavioral 
impairment 
in 
37% 
of 
the 
children.4 
In 


the 
majority 
of 
children 
with 
behavioral 
problems, 
T 
scores 
placed 
them 
in 
the 
“borderline” 
rather 
than 
the 
“clinically 
significant” 
category, 
but 
nearly 
all 
children 
improved 
after 
adenotonsillectomy. 
This 
study 
confirms 
these 
findings 
but 
also 
shows 
that 
children 
with 
mild 
SDB 
may 
have 
similar 
behavioral 
problems 
that 
also 
improve 
significantly 
after 
surgical 
therapy. 


Several 
previous 
studies 
have 
examined 
the 
association 
between 
child 
behavior 
and 
the 
severity 
of 
SDB.2 
Kaemingk 
et 
al.9 
found 
that 
children 
with 
an 
AHI 
greater 
than 
5 
had 
significantly 
more 
problems 
with 
learning 
and 
memory 
than 
children 
with 
an 
AHI 
less 
than 
5. 
In 
contrast, 
Owens 
et 
al.10 
and 
Friedman 
et 
al.11 
showed 
little 
correlation 
between 
behavioral 
problems 
and 
the 
severity 
of 
OSA 
as 
measured 
by 
polysomnography. 
Unfortunately, 
these 
findings 
were 
limited 
by 
small 
study 
populations 
that 
may 
not 
have 
provided 
sufficient 
statistical 
power. 
However, 
a 
recent 
study 
by 
Chervin 
et 
al.12 
that 
included 
105 
children 
with 
polysomnography-proven 
SDB 
failed 
to 
show 
a 
significant 
association 
between 
the 
severity 
of 
baseline 
SDB 
and 
behavioral 
problems. 
Furthermore, 
several 
studies 
have 
shown 
that 
even 
children 
with 
primary 
snoring13,14 
have 
more 
social 
problems, 
more 
symptoms 
of 
anxiety 
and 
depression, 
as 
well 
as 
decreased 
attention 
and 
memory 
when 
compared 
with 
nonsnoring 
children. 


There 
are 
a 
number 
of 
explanations 
for 
the 
remarkable 
finding 
that 
both 
mild 
SDB 
and 
OSA 
in 
children 
are 
associated 
with 
similar 
behavioral 
problems. 
First, 
the 
severity 
of 
SDB 
was 
measured 
by 
the 
AHI 
in 
this 
study. 
It 
is 
possible 
that 
other 
parameters 
of 
sleep 
behavior 
measured 
objectively 
with 
polysomnography 
may 
correlate 
more 
closely 
with 
behavioral 
problems. 
In 
children 
with 
primary 
snoring, 
Kennedy 
et 
al.14 
showed 
that 
increased 
numbers 
of 
oxygen 
desaturations 
and 
respiratory 
arousals 
are 
associated 
with 
greater 
impairment 
of 
neurocognitive 
performance, 
particularly 
intelligence 
and 
memory. 
Clearly, 
in 
future 
research, 
it 
would 
be 
helpful 
to 
examine 
a 
variety 
of 
respiratory 
and 
nonrespiratory 
parameters 
measured 
by 
polysomnography

and 
correlate 
them 
with 
behavioral 
scales 
affected 
by 
SDB. 
Finally, 
in 
this 
study, 
child 
behavior 
was 
evaluated 
using 
caregiver 
proxy 
reports 
from 
the 
BASC 
survey 
instrument. 
Direct 
neuropsychological 
testing 
of 
children 
may 
have 
revealed 
aspects 
of 
behavior 
that 
correlate 
more 
closely 
with 
the 
severity 
SDB 
as 
measured 
by 
polysomnography. 


The 
strengths 
of 
the 
present 
study 
are 
its 
prospective 
design 
and 
the 
fact 
that 
all 
children 
underwent 
objective 
evaluation 
with 
polysomnography 
to 
establish 
the 
relative 
severity 
of 
their 
sleep 
disorder. 
However, 
the 
study 
also 
has 
a 
number 
of 
limitations. 
It 
was 
not 
feasible 
to 
withhold 
surgical 
treatment 
for 
a 
period 
of 
several 
months 
in 
children 
with 
SDB, 
and 
consequently 
there 
was 
no 
control 
group. 
A 
comparison 
group 
of 
children 
undergoing 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
recurrent 
throat 
infections 
but 
without 
SDB 
may 
have 
been 
useful 
in 
excluding 
the 
placebo 
effect 
of 
surgical 
intervention. 
Based 
on 
the 
present 
study, 
it 
cannot 
be 
stated 
with 
certainty 
that 
a 
causal 
relationship 
exists 
between 
adenotonsillectomy 
and 
improvements 
in 
behavior. 
To 
some 
degree, 
these 
improvements, 
seen 
in 
a 
relatively 
small 
number 
of 
40 
children, 
may 
represent 
regression 
toward 
the 
mean 
or 
the 
natural 
tendency 
of 
the 
behavioral 
problems 
to 
resolve 
over 
time. 
Second, 
children 
in 
this 
study 
were 
recruited 
from 
an 
otolaryngology 
clinic 
where 
they 
were 
seen 
for 
a 
sleep 
disturbance 
and 
considered 
for 
surgical 
therapy. 
This 
introduced 
a 
selection 
bias 
because 
these 
children 
were 
more 
likely 
to 
be 
symptomatic 
than 
were 
children 
with 
a 
similar 
condition 
whose 
caregivers 
did 
not 
seek 
surgical 
intervention. 
Third, 
the 
follow-up 
period 
was 
less 
than 
6 
months 
and 
did 
not 
include 
postoperative 
polysomnography. 
It 
is 
conceivable 
that 
children 
with 
mild 
SDB 
respond 
differently 
to 
surgical 
therapy 
as 
compared 
with 
children 
with 
OSA 
when 
followed 
for 
a 
longer 
time. 
Equally, 
it 
is 
difficult 
to 
correlate 
the 
sleep 
apnea 
or 
SDB 
improvement 
with 
the 
improvement 
in 
BASC 
scores. 
Many 
of 
these 
limitations 
are 
a 
reflection 
of 
the 
difficulties 
in 
studying 
the 
outcome 
of 
surgery 
on 
behavior 
in 
a 
large 
number 
of 
children 
with 
SDB 
with 
suitable 
controls 
and 
objective 
outcome 
measures, 
as 
discussed 
in 
an 
excellent 
review 
by 
Ebert 
and 
Drake.15 
Nonetheless, 
improvements 
in 
child 
behavior 
in 
the 
short 
term 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
appear 
to 
be 
significant 
regardless 
of 
the 
severity 
of 
the 
sleep 
disorder. 


CONCLUSION 


The 
results 
of 
this 
study 
suggest 
that 
SDB 
may 
be 
associated 
with 
significant 
behavioral 
problems 
regardless 
of 
the 
relative 
severity 
of 
the 
sleep 
disorder. 
These 
behavioral 
problems 
improve 
after 
adenotonsillectomy, 


but 
the 
extent 
of 
improvement 
is 
not 
related 
to 
whether 
a 
child 
has 
mild 
SDB 
or 
OSA.
