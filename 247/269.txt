Abstract 


Background: 
tonsillectomy 
(TE) 
is 
currently 
the 
most 
common 
treatment 
for 
children 
with 
snoring 
and 
sleep 
apnea. 
Many 
of 
these 
children 
have 
not 
had 
any 
severe 
throat 
infections. 
To 
cure 
such 
children 
from 
their 
obstructive 
problems, 
without 
influencing 
the 
immunological 
function 
of 
the 
tonsils, 
tonsillotomy 
(TT) 
with 
CO2-laser 
was 
performed 
in 
a 
randomized 
study 
comparing 
it 
to 
regular 
tonsillectomy, 
with 
special 
attention 
to 
postoperative 
pain 
and 
symptom 
recurrence. 
Method: 
41 
children 
3.5–8 
years-old 
were 
included 
— 
21 
‘TT’s’ 
and 
20 
‘TE’s’. 
They 
were 
all 
operated 
under 
the 
same 
anesthesia 
and 
followed 
the 
same 
postoperative 
scheme 
for 
analgesia. 
A 
visual 
analogue 
scale 
for 
pain 
measurements 
with 
faces 
was 
used 
for 
the 
first 
24 
h. 
After 
that, 
each 
day 
until 
pain-free, 
the 
parents 
registered 
the 
child’s 
pain 
on 
a 
three 
graded 
scale, 
what 
the 
child 
was 
able 
to 
eat, 
and 
the 
amount 
of 
analgesic 
drugs 
used. 
Results: 
all 
the 
children 
were 
cured 
from 
their 
breathing 
obstruction. 
The 
mean 
time 
used 
for 
the 
surgery 
was 
the 
same 
and 
no 
postoperative 
bleeding 
was 
seen 
in 
either 
group. 
‘TT 
children’ 
were 
pain-free 
after 
5 
days 
and 
‘TE 
children’ 
after 
8 
days. 
Eight 
to 
ten 
days 
after 
surgery, 
the 
TT-children 
had 
gained 
weight 
and 
the 
TE 
children 
lost 
weight 
significantly. 
The 
TE 
group 
used 
twice 
as 
much 
analgesic 
drugs 
as 
the 
TT 
group 
during 
the 
first 
postoperative 
week. 
The 
TT 
group 
was 
healed 
with 
normal-looking, 
but 
small 
tonsils 
after 
8–10 
days; 
the 
TE 
group 
often 
still 
showed 
edema 
and 
crusts. 
At 
the 
one-year 
follow-up 
2:21among 
the 
‘TT-children’ 
snored, 
but 
did 
not 
require 
re-surgery. 
Conclusion: 
tonsillotomy 
is 
much 
less 
painful 
than 
TE 
and 
children 
recover 
more 
quickly. 
Results 
with 
respect 
to 
breathing 
obstruction 
are 
almost 
the 
same 
for 
both 
methods 
at 
1-year 
follow-up.

mostly 
on 
children 
who 
have 
obstructive 
problems 
caused 
by 
tonsillar 
hypertrophy. 
The 
general 
impression 
has 
been 
that 
this 
kind 
of 
surgery 
seems 
to 
be 
gentler 
to 
the 
patients; 
they 
are 
noted 
to 
recover 
faster 
and 
to 
have 
less 
pain. 
Before 
recommending 
the 
technique 
to 
other 
centers, 
some 
issues 
must 
be 
addressed. 
Are 
there 
risks 
associated 
with 
partial 
removal 
of 
the 
tonsils? 
One 
obvious 
possibility 
is 
that 
the 
remaining 
parts 
of 
the 
tonsils 
will 
start 
to 
grow 
again 
and 
give 
the 
child 
the 
same 
symptoms 
once 
more. 
Another 
possible 
risk 
is 
that 
the 
partial 
resection 
will 
cause 
scar 
tissue 
in 
the 
tonsils. 
The 
deformed 
tissue 
may 
predispose 
to 
deeper 
infections 
or 
peritonsillitis. 
Older 
colleagues, 
who 
have 
witnessed 
how 
guillotine 
tonsillotomies 
were 
performed 
frequently 
during 
the 
first 
part 
of 
this 
century 
and 
then 
abandoned, 
draw 
a 
parallel 
with 
that 
technique. 
However, 
going 
through 
the 
literature 
we 
found 
that 
there 
is 
really 
no 
convincing 
evidence 
for 
such 
risks 
if 
the 
surgery 
was 
performed 
under 
safe 
conditions 
in 
skilful 
hands 
[3,4]. 
Thus, 
the 
fear 
of 
late 
infectious 
complications 
after 
a 
partial 
resection 
of 
the 
tonsil 
may 
well 
be 
unfounded. 
Furthermore, 
if 
the 
risks 
can 
be 
estimated, 
we 
also 
need 
to 
document 
the 
benefits. 
Are 
there 
any 
real 
advantages 
compared 
to 
regular 
tonsillectomy 
and 
in 
that 
case 
how 
can 
these 
advantages 
be 
weighed 
against 
the 
risks? 
The 
purpose 
of 
the 
present 
investigation 
is 
to 
compare 
the 
effect 
of 
tonsillotomy 
using 
CO2 
laser 
(TT) 
with 
tonsillectomy 
using 
regular 
surgical 
technique 
(TE) 
with 
respect 
to 
postoperative 
pain, 
duration 
of 
surgery, 
perioperative 
bleeding, 
and 
need 
for 
hospitalization. 
The 
long-term 
effects 
on 
the 
obstructive 
symptoms 
after 
6 
months 
and 
1 
year 
are 
also 
evaluated. 
The 
patients 
were 
randomized 
to 
the 
two 
surgical 
procedures. 


2. 
Method 
Out 
of 
50 
children, 
who 
were 
randomized 
to 
the 
study 
41 
were 
included, 
15 
girls 
and 
26 
boys 
3.5–8 
years 
old 
(691.5). 
All 
of 
them 
had 
been 
put 
on 
the 
waiting 
list 
for 
tonsillar 
surgery 
due 
to 
obstructive 
problems: 
snoring 
and:or 
sleep 
apnea, 
mouth 
breathing, 
and:or 
eating 
problems. 
They 
all 
had 
a 
verified 
tonsillar 
hyperplasia 
and 
none 
of 
them 
had 
had 
repeated 
streptococcal 
throat 
infections. 
The 
randomization 
was 
performed 
from 
the 
waiting 
list 
and 
the 
parents 
informed 
by 
mail. 
They 
could 
change 
the 
decision 
about 
the 
choice 
of 
method, 
but 
in 
that 
case 
the 
child 
was 
excluded 
from 
the 
study. 
The 
Ethics 
Committee 
at 
Uppsala 
University 
approved 
the 
investigation. 
All 
patients 
were 
kept 
on 
the 
ward 
24 
h 
postoperatively, 
irrespective 
of 
the 
procedure 
performed. 
The 
children 
were 
weighed 
on 
the 
morning 
of 
the 
surgery 
‘on 
an 
empty 
stomach’. 


The 
surgery 
was 
performed 
in 
21 
cases 
as 
tonsillotomy 
(TT) 
with 
CO2-laser, 
20 
W 
(continuous 
mode). 
The 
surgical 
technique 
is 
described 
in 
detail 
in 
our 
previous 
paper 
[2]. 
The 
same 
surgeon 
(AL) 
performed 
all 
the 
tonsillotomies. 
Those 
specialists 
in 
the 
department, 
who 
regularly 
do 
tonsillectomies, 
operated 
the 
20 
control 
patients. 
Three 
children 
in 
each 
group 
had 
an 
adenoidectomy 
on 
the 
same 
occasion 
using 
conventional 
surgical 
technique. 
The 
total 
time 
in 
the 
operating 
theatre, 
the 
duration 
of 
the 
surgery, 
and 
the 
amount 
of 
blood 
loss 
were 
recorded. 
Postoperative 
pain 
was 
measured 
by 
means 
of 
a 
pediatric 
visual 
analogue 
scale 
(VAS) 
showing 
faces 
with 
increasing 
expressions 
of 
distress 
(Fig. 
1). 
VAS 
measurements 
were 
obtained 
during 
the 
first 
24 
h, 
once 
every 
hour 
while 
the 
patient 
was 
awake. 


Pain, 
general 
condition 
and 
alertness 
were 
recorded, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
elapsed 
time 
before 
resumption 
of 
drinking 
and 
eating.

analogue 
scale 
(VAS) 
used 
in 
the 
pain 
measurements 
during 
the 
over-night 
stay 
on 
the 
ward. 
The 
child 
indicates 
a 
face 
that 
appears 
to 
match 
the 
pain 
they 
are 
feeling 
at 
that 
moment. 
The 
nurse 
or 
surgeon 
records 
the 
ordinal 
number 
of 
the 
face 
(the 
leftmost 
face 
showing 
no 
distress 
is 
given 
the 
number 
0).

A 
simplified 
rating 
was 
used 
for 
the 
subsequent 
seven 
days. 
At 
discharge 
24 
h 
after 
surgery, 
the 
parents 
were 
instructed 
to 
fill 
out 
a 
form 
each 
day 
recording 
the 
child’s 
pain 
on 
a 
three 
graded 
scale, 
and 
how 
much 
and 
at 
what 
time 
analgesic 
drugs 
were 
administered. 
They 
were 
also 
asked 
to 
record 
how 
well 
the 
child 
ate 
(less, 
more, 
normal 
amounts) 
and 
which 
kind 
of 
food 
(liquid, 
pure´e 
or 
normal). 


While 
hospitalized 
and 
afterwards, 
paracetamol 
or 
paracetamol:codeine 
were 
used 
(Supp. 
Citodone® 
25 
mg:kg 
bwt) 
for 
pain 
relief. 
Pethidine 
i.v. 
could 
be 
given 
if 
required, 
in 
doses 
of 
5 
mg 
during 
the 
first 
few 
hours. 
Children 
weighing 
more 
than 
30 
kg 
(only 
three), 
could 
also 
be 
given 
supp. 
diclofenac, 
which 
they 
could 
continue 
with 
at 
home 
as 
long 
as 
needed. 
However, 
mix. 
Paracetamol 
was 
the 
drug 
most 
children 
used 
after 
discharge. 
The 
parents 
recorded 
the 
number 
of 
doses 
given. 


All 
the 
children 
attended 
a 
post-operative 
check-up 
in 
the 
office 
7–9 
days 
after 
surgery. 
The 
child 
and 
the 
parents 
brought 
the 
written 
report 
to 
this 
visit 
and 
also 
gave 
their 
opinion 
orally 
of 
the 
procedure. 
The 
child 
was 
examined 
and 
weighed. 
At 
6 
months, 
and 
at 
one 
year 
after 
surgery, 
the 
parents 
were 
sent 
a 
questionnaire, 
where 
they 
reported 
on 
the 
child’s 
preoperative 
symptoms 
and 
how 
these 
had 
changed 
after 
surgery. 
Visual 
analogue 
scales 
were 
used. 
Snoring, 
breathing 
stops 
and 
eating 
problems 
were 
asked 
about, 
and 
there 
was 
also 
a 
more 
general 
question: 
Are 
you 
and 
your 
child 
satisfied 
with 
the 
result 
of 
the 
surgery? 


2.1. 
Statistics 
The 
inter 
group 
differences 
in 
pain 
score 
and 
in 
incidence 
of 
weight 
gain:loss 
were 
tested 
with 
non-parametric 
methods 
(x2 
or 
Fisher). 
The 
other 
variables 
were 
compared 
using 
Student’s 
t-test 
or 
confidence 
intervals. 


3. 
Results 
Twenty-one 
patients 
were 
operated 
on 
by 
TT, 
and 
20 
by 
TE 
of 
the 
50 
children 
who 
were 
origi


nally 
randomized 
from 
the 
waiting 
list. 
Only 
one 
child 
in 
each 
group 
was 
excluded 
because 
the 
parents 
had 
a 
preference 
for 
the 
other 
surgical 
technique; 
in 
these 
cases 
the 
child 
was 
not 
operated 
according 
to 
the 
random 
allocation. 
Of 
the 
rest, 
four 
parents 
did 
not 
want 
any 
surgery 
at 
all, 
three 
of 
these 
were 
randomized 
to 
TE. 
The 
remaining 
three 
children 
excluded 
were 
randomized 
to 
TT, 
but 
at 
admission, 
the 
case 
history 
showed 
too 
many 
throat 
infections; 
in 
these 
cases, 
we 
preferred 
to 
perform 
tonsillectomy. 


The 
total 
perioperative 
blood 
loss 
and 
the 
average 
duration 
of 
surgery 
for 
the 
two 
groups 
are 
reported 
in 
Table 
1. 


The 
postoperative 
pain-score 
was 
significantly 
lower 
for 
the 
first 
24 
h 
for 
the 
TT 
children 
than 
for 
the 
TE 
children, 
(see 
Fig. 
2). 
The 
amount 
of 
analgesic 
drugs 
administered 
during 
the 
day 
of 
surgery 
was 
the 
same 
for 
both 
groups, 
four 
doses, 
despite 
the 
higher 
pain 
score 
for 
the 
TE 
children. 
Only 
two 
of 
the 
TE 
children 
had 
no 
scoring 
above 
three 
compared 
to 
to 
seven 
in 
the 
TT 
group. 
One 
of 
the 
TT 
children 
had 
to 
stay 
another 
night 
due 
to 
a 
high 
temperature. 


During 
the 
following 
seven 
days 
at 
home, 
the 
TT 
children 
received 
significantly 
fewer 
doses 
of 
analgesics 
than 
the 
TE 
children 
did. 
The 
mean 
difference 
was 
8.8 
doses 
(P0.0016, 
CI 
95% 
3.6– 
14.1). 
(See 
Table 
1). 
On 
the 
average, 
the 
TT 
children 
were 
pain-free 
three 
days 
earlier 
than 
the 
TE 
children 
(see 
Table 
1). 
Likewise, 
TT 
children 
returned 
to 
a 
normal 
diet 
three 
days 
before 
the 
TE 
children. 
At 
the 
postoperative 
control, 
the 
TT 
children 
had 
gained 
weight 
and 
the 
TE 
children 
had 
lost 
weight. 
The 
mean 
difference 
was 
almost 
800g(P0.01, 
CI 
95% 
1.33–0.19) 
(see 
Table 
1). 


The 
breathing 
obstruction 
symptoms 
were 
completely 
relieved 
8–10 
days 
postoperatively 
in 
all 
the 
children 
of 
both 
groups. 
The 
eating 
problems 
had 
also 
disappeared 
except 
for 
five 
TE 
children 
who 
still 
were 
in 
pain. 


Six 
months 
post 
surgery, 
two 
children 
in 
the 
TT 
group 
had 
started 
to 
snore 
again. 
These 
children 
were 
checked 
up 
in 
the 
office. 
One 
was 
found 
to 
have 
hypertrophied 
tonsils 
and 
the 
other 
was 
heavily 
overweight. 
The 
parents 
reported 
that 
snoring 
was 
less 
pronounced 
than 
pre 
surgery 
and 
the 
children 
no 
longer 
had 
apneas.

Discussion 
4.1. 
Pain 
de6elopment 
after 
surgery 
Tonsillectomy 
is 
a 
routine 
procedure 
in 
ENT 
surgery. 
However, 
recovery 
from 
tonsillectomy 
is 
a 
painful 
experience 
[5,6]. 
Almost 
all 
children 
got 
Pethidine, 
5 
mg 
i.v. 
in 
the 
recovery 
room. 
During 
the 
first 
24 
h 
post-operatively 
the 
TT-children 
showed 
significant 
lower 
pain 
judging 
from 
the 
VAS 
score, 
although 
both 
groups 
received 
the 
same 
amount 
of 
analgesic 
drugs. 
This 
indicates 
that 
the 
medication 
followed 
the 
conventional 
dosing 
schedule 
rather 
than 
the 
pain 
of 
the 
child. 


As 
a 
routine 
at 
our 
hospital, 
after 
discharge 
from 
the 
hospital 
the 
children 
were 
prescribed 
paracetamol 
or 
paracetamol:codeine 
10–15 
mg/ 
kg 
body 
weight 
(bwt) 
four 
times:day. 
The 
three 
children, 
who 
weighed 
more 
than 
30 
kg 
in 
addition 
also 
received 
supp 
diclofenac 
25 
mg, 
three 


times:day. 
The 
parents 
had 
been 
told 
to 
give 
the 
child 
analgesics 
when 
the 
child 
was 
in 
pain. 
On 
the 
visit 
7–9 
days 
after 
operation, 
we 
could 
see 
from 
the 
report 
form 
that 
even 
if 
the 
TE 
children 
had 
indicated 
severe 
pain, 
several 
parents 
had 
not 
given 
the 
prescribed 
analgesics. 
Probably, 
the 
parents 
had 
not 
taken 
into 
account 
that 
refusal 
to 
eat 
could 
be 
an 
indirect 
indication 
of 
pain. 
This 
is 
in 
agreement 
with 
several 
studies 
that 
show 
that 
in 
general, 
post 
tonsillectomy 
pain 
is 
poorly 
managed 
by 
parents 
[7] 
and 
professionals 
[8].

51 
(1999) 
171–176 
175 
The 
TT 
children 
were 
pain-free 
after 
5 
days 
compared 
with 
the 
TE 
children 
who 
were 
not 
pain-free 
until 
day 
8. 
This 
differences 
between 
the 
groups 
would 
probably 
have 
been 
less 
if 
the 
parents 
had 
been 
told 
to 
give 
analgesics 
four 
times/ 
day 
and 
in 
a 
higher 
dosage, 
whether 
the 
child 
claimed 
to 
be 
in 
pain 
or 
not. 
Andersson 
et 
al., 
have 
shown 
that 
paracetamol 
could 
be 
increased 
to 
15–25 
mg:bwt 
given 
as 
suppositories 
up 
to 
six 
times:day 
[9]. 


All 
variables 
measured 
in 
the 
present 
study 
consistently 
indicated 
less 
pain 
for 
the 
TT 
children: 
VAS, 
the 
amount 
of 
analgesic 
drugs 
needed, 
and 
which 
day 
normal 
eating 
was 
resumed. 
Especially, 
the 
influence 
on 
weight, 
during 
the 
first 
postoperative 
week 
for 
the 
two 
groups 
is 
remarkable, 
an 
increase 
in 
weight 
for 
the 
TT 
children 
and 
a 
loss 
for 
the 
TE 
children. 
The 
amount 
of 
weight 
gain 
and 
weight 
loss, 
respectively, 
can 
not 
be 
evaluated 
from 
the 
figures 
as 
the 
children 
preoperatively 
were 
weighed 
‘on 
an 
empty 
stomach’ 
and 
at 
the 
postoperative 
visit 
came 
after 
lunch, 
some 
having 
eaten 
and 
some 
not. 
However, 
those 
conditions 
were 
the 
same 
for 
both 
the 
TE 
and 
TT 
children, 
and 
thus 
the 
comparison 
is 
valid. 
The 
decrease 
of 
weight 
for 
the 
TE 
children 
indicates 
probably 
both 
less 
intake 
of 
food 
and 
a 
catabolic 
metabolism 
due 
to 
pain. 


The 
findings 
in 
this 
study 
support 
the 
conclusion 
from 
our 
previous 
study 
[2] 
that 
a 
partial 
resection 
of 
the 
tonsil 
causes 
less 
pain 
than 
a 
complete 
tonsillectomy. 
The 
CO2-laser 
is 
an 
indispensable 
tool 
for 
tonsillotomy, 
but 
use 
of 
the 
laser 
does 
not 
by 
itself 
reduce 
the 
pain. 
In 
several 
studies 
[10,11] 
complete 
tonsillectomy 
performed 
with 
surgical 
laser 
caused 
a 
delayed 
pain 
that 
may 
be 
worse 
than 
the 
pain 
after 
conventional 
tonsillectomy. 
The 
difference 
is 
in 
the 
surface 
left 
to 
heal: 
the 
lymphoid 
tissue 
of 
the 
tonsils 
does 
not 
seem 
to 
be 
as 
pain 
sensitive 
as 
the 
tonsillar 
pillars 
and 
does 
not 
show 
the 
intense 
inflammation 
clearly 
visible 
during 
the 
recovery 
after 
tonsillectomy. 


4.2. 
Post-operati6e 
bleeding 
There 
is 
a 
small 
but 
alarming 
risk 
of 
bleeding 
7–10 
days 
after 
tonsillectomy 
[6]. 
The 
intra 
opera


tive 
bleeding 
observed 
in 
the 
present 
study 
was 
small 
in 
both 
groups, 
but 
was 
significantly 
smaller 
for 
the 
TT 
children. 
No 
postoperative 
bleeding 
was 
noted. 
Due 
to 
the 
comparatively 
small 
group, 
the 
results 
must 
be 
interpreted 
with 
care. 
However, 
our 
experience 
to 
date 
includes 
more 
than 
100 
children 
operated 
with 
CO2-laser: 
the 
21 
children 
in 
the 
present 
study, 
33 
children 
reported 
in 
a 
previous 
study 
[2] 
and 
more 
than 
fifty 
children 
operated 
after 
completion 
of 
the 
studies. 
In 
none 
of 
these 
cases 
we 
have 
had 
any 
postoperative 
bleeding. 
We 
do 
not 
expect 
such 
bleeding 
since 
the 
tonsils 
are 
completely 
epithelialized 
and 
look 
normal 
after 
7–10 
days. 


4.3. 
Need 
for 
hospitalization 
In 
this 
study, 
all 
children 
were 
admitted 
as 
inpatients 
to 
insure 
uniform 
care 
for 
both 
groups 
and 
to 
provide 
similar 
conditions 
for 
pain 
registration. 
Only 
one 
child 
in 
the 
TT-group, 
who 
developed 
high 
temperature, 
was 
kept 
for 
an 
extra 
night. 
The 
positive 
results 
with 
respect 
to 
pain 
and 
bleeding 
were 
so 
convincing, 
that 
we 
have 
not 
hesitated 
to 
continue 
to 
do 
tonsillotomies 
with 
CO2-laser 
in 
day 
care 
surgery. 
In 
countries, 
like 
ours, 
where 
tonsillectomies 
are 
still 
performed 
with 
patients 
staying 
in 
the 
hospital 
for 
one 
or 
more 
nights, 
a 
change 
to 
tonsillotomy 
will 
be 
advantageous 
economically. 
However, 
with 
the 
pain 
better 
controlled 
after 
TE, 
nothing 
else 
in 
our 
investigation 
contradict 
the 
possibility 
to 
perform 
both 
kinds 
of 
surgery 
in 
day 
care. 


4.4. 
Gender 
aspects 
Almost 
twice 
as 
many 
boys 
as 
girls 
taken 
from 
the 
ordinary 
waiting 
list, 
were 
operated 
in 
this 
study. 
Is 
tonsillar 
hypertrophy 
more 
commons 
in 
boys? 
A 
recent 
epidemiological 
study 
of 
snoring 
and 
other 
obstructive 
problems 
done 
in 
the 
same 
geographic 
area 
among 
4 
and 
6-year-old 
children 
did 
not 
find 
sex 
differences 
[12]. 
An 
Icelandic 
study 
has 
earlier 
shown 
that 
the 
prevalence 
of 
sleep 
apnea 
for 
boys 
is 
highest 
at 
2.5 
years 
and 
for 
girls 
at 
5 
years 
[13]. 
Based 
on 
those 
data, 
we 
would 
have 
expected 
more 
girls 
to 
be 
treated. 
Could 
the 
reason 
be 
that 
parents 
(and 
the 
doc

tors?) 
are 
more 
hesitant 
to 
have 
surgery 
performed 
on 
girls 
than 
on 
boys 
— 
or 
are 
the 
symptoms 
more 
noticeable 
in 
boys? 
These 
questions 
cannot 
be 
fully 
addressed 
here, 
but 
will 
be 
followed 
up 
in 
a 
later 
study. 


4.5. 
Long 
term 
impro6ement 
of 
obstruction 
All 
the 
children 
had 
been 
put 
on 
the 
waiting 
list 
for 
operation 
due 
to 
obstructive 
symptoms: 
snoring 
and:or 
sleep 
apneas, 
mouth 
breathing, 
and:or 
eating 
problems. 
These 
symptoms 
were 
completely 
relived 
in 
both 
groups 
at 
7–9 
days 
after 
operation. 
Six 
months 
later, 
two 
children 
in 
the 
TT 
group 
had 
started 
to 
snore 
again. 
Only 
one 
child 
showed 
a 
recurrence 
of 
tonsillar 
hypertrophy. 
At 
the 
1-year 
follow 
up, 
this 
child 
was 
still 
snoring, 
but 
according 
to 
the 
parents 
less 
than 
before 
surgery 
with 
no 
apneas, 
why 
we 
decided 
further 
expectancy. 
The 
symptoms 
progressed 
during 
the 
second 
year 
and 
the 
boy 
is 
now 
scheduled 
for 
TE. 
The 
second 
child, 
who 
snored 
after 
6 
months, 
was 
considerably 
overweight 
which 
could 
be 
the 
cause 
of 
snoring 
since 
no 
hypertrophy 
of 
the 
tonsils 
could 
be 
noted. 
This 
child 
was 
still 
snoring 
after 
1 
year 
but 
to 
a 
lesser 
degree 
and 
both 
the 
child 
and 
the 
parents 
were 
satisfied 
with 
the 
situation. 
An 
increase 
of 
weight 
the 
first 
year 
after 
tonsillectomy 
has 
been 
reported 
earlier 
[14]. 
It 
is 
probably 
due 
to 
both 
increased 
appetite 
and 
that 
the 
child 
develops 
a 
more 
anabolic 
situation 
after 
relief 
of 
the 
stressful, 
obstructive 
problems. 


5. 
Conclusion 
The 
present 
study 
shows 
that 
it 
may 
be 
time 
to 
reconsider 
the 
operation 
technique 
for 
tonsillhypertrophy. 
The 
CO2-laser 
technique 
should 
not 
be 
confused 
with 
older 
methods 
of 
tonsillotomy 
[3,4]. 
The 
results 
of 
the 
present 
study 
indicate 
that 
tonsillotomy 
with 
CO2-laser 
are 
safe 
to 
perform 
and 
efficient 
in 
cases 
where 
obstruction 
and 
not 
streptococcal 
infections 
motivate 
the 
surgery. 
The 
improvement 
of 
symptoms 
and 
signs 
remained 
one 
year 
after 
surgery. 
The 
pain 
was 
much 
less 
for 


. 


the 
children 
operated 
with 
CO2-laser. 
A 
technique, 
which 
reduces 
post-operative 
pain, 
must 
be 
taken 
seriously. 
However, 
treatment 
of 
children 
who 
experience 
pain 
while 
still 
in 
the 
hospital 
and 
later 
at 
home 
still 
needs 
to 
be 
improved.
