OBJECTIVE: 
Evaluate 
a 
database 
of 
pediatric 
patients 
who 
underwent 
snoring 
acoustical 
analysis 
for 
associations 
between 
snoring 
measurements, 
demographics, 
and 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea/hypopnea 
syndrome 
(OSAHS) 
severity. 
STUDY 
DESIGN 
AND 
SETTING: 
A 
database 
of 
pediatric 
patients 
who 
underwent 
home 
testing 
with 
a 
polysomnogram 
device 
(SNAP 
Test, 
Glenview, 
IL) 
that 
includes 
acoustical 
snoring 
analysis 
was 
reviewed. 
RESULTS: 
Four 
hundred 
fifty-six 
patients 
were 
included 
(mean 
age, 
6.87 
years). 
Four 
hundred 
twenty-nine 
(94.1%) 
patients 
had 
measurable 
snoring. 
Snoring 
index 
(events/hr) 
(r 
0.2073; 
P 
. 
0.0001) 
and 
maximal 
loudness 
(dB) 
(r 
0.2218; 
P 
0.0001) 
were 
directly 
proportional 
to 
the 
apnea/hypopnea 
index. 
Among 
patients 
without 
OSAHS 
(apnea 
index 
1), 
increasing 
snoring 
index 
(r 
0.2102; 
P 
0.0001) 
and 
volume 
(P 
0.005 
ANOVA) 
were 
associated 
with 
increasing 
oximetry 
desaturation 
events. 
CONCLUSION: 
The 
majority 
of 
children 
evaluated 
had 
objective 
snoring. 
Increasing 
snoring 
index 
and 
loudness 
are 
associated 
with 
increased 
severity 
of 
OSAHS. 
In 
the 
absence 
of 
OSAHS, 
increasing 
snoring 
is 
associated 
with 
oxygen 
desaturations. 
SIGNIFICANCE: 
Pediatric 
snoring 
is 
objectively 
related 
to 
OSAHS 
severity.

ediatric 
snoring 
is 
gaining 
increasing 
attention. 
It 
is 
the 
cardinal 
symptom 
of 
pediatric 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea/ 
hypopnea 
syndrome 
(OSAHS), 
which 
has 
well-known 
morbidity. 
Furthermore, 
increasing 
evidence 
suggests 
that 
pe


diatric 
snoring 
itself, 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
formal 
OSAHS, 
is 
strongly 
linked 
to 
neurocognitive 
morbidity 
in 
developing 
children.1-4 Despite this, little is known about pediatric 
snoring. 
An 
analysis 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
effects 
of 
age, 
sex, 
and 
body 
mass 
index 
(BMI) 
on 
objectively 
measured 
pediatric 
snoring 
has 
not 
been 
performed. 
In 
addition, 
the 
relationship 
between 
the 
objectively 
measured 
magnitude, 
loudness, 
and 
type 
of 
pediatric 
snoring 
and 
OSAHS 
severity 
is 
unknown. 


Currently 
available 
technology 
does 
provide 
a 
detailed 
and 
accurate 
acoustical 
snoring 
analysis. 
This 
acoustic 
analysis 
has 
been 
found 
to 
significantly 
improve 
outcomes 
in 
the 
management 
of 
adult 
snoring 
by 
allowing 
for 
improved 
identification 
of 
patients 
with 
predominantly 
soft 
palate 
snoring 
who 
are 
superior 
candidates 
for 
palatal 
stiffening 
snoring treatments.5 The purpose of this study was to evaluate 
a 
database 
of 
pediatric 
patients 
who 
underwent 
home 
sleep 
testing 
with 
concurrent 
acoustical 
analysis 
of 
snoring 
for 
trends 
among 
snoring 
and 
easily 
measurable 
demographic 
data 
(age, 
sex, 
BMI) 
as 
well 
as 
trends 
between 
objective 
snoring 
measurements 
and 
OSAHS 
severity. 


METHODS

Brietzke and Mair Acoustical analysis of pediatric snoring . . . 

patients 
referred 
for 
parental 
concern 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
who 
underwent 
home 
sleep 
testing 
with 
a 
“take 
home” 
polysomnogram 
device 
(SNAP 
Test, 
SNAP 
Labs, 
Glenview, 
IL) 
was 
reviewed. 
SNAP 
Labs 
provided 
this 
database 
unconditionally 
and 
was 
not 
involved 
in 
the 
data 
analysis. 
The 
database 
represents 
patients 
who 
underwent 
recent 
(2003–2004) 
SNAP 
testing 
from 
all 
areas 
of 
the 
country. 
Age, 
sex, 
and 
BMI 
were 
recorded. 
Race 
and 
status 
of 
adenotonsillar 
tissue 
were 
not 
available. 
Patients 
with 
incomplete 
data 
were 
excluded. 


The 
SNAP 
test 
uses 
acoustic 
measurements 
of 
oronasal 
respirations 
to 
generate 
an 
apnea/hypopnea 
index 
(AHI) 
to 
diagnose 
OSAHS 
as 
well 
as 
to 
perform 
various 
snoring 
measurements. 
The 
SNAP 
test 
has 
been 
validated 
versus overnight polysomnography in adult patients.6 No 
validation 
studies 
have 
been 
published 
in 
children. 
However, 
studies 
that 
evaluate 
the 
accuracy 
of 
sonography 
versus 
polysomnography 
in 
children 
have 
been 
reported 
and show an excellent correlation.7,8 The SNAP test 
produces 
five 
primary 
snoring 
acoustical 
analysis 
measurements 
(Table 1). Continuous pulse oximetry is also 
included 
in 
the 
test. 
The 
standard 
recording 
time 
is 
6 
hours. 
Each 
patient/parent 
was 
instructed 
on 
the 
proper 
use 
of 
the 
device 
in 
the 
clinic, 
took 
the 
device 
home 
or 
received 
it 
in 
the 
mail, 
used 
the 
test, 
and 
then 
mailed 
the 
data 
disk 
to 
the 
SNAP 
Laboratory 
facility 
where 
it 
was 
scored 
in 
a 
blinded 
manner 
by 
a 
technician 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
proprietary 
computer 
software. 


Statistical 
analysis 
was 
performed 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
computer 
software 
(STATA 
version 
8.2 
College 
Station, 
Texas). 
Trends 
were 
assessed 
with 
the 
Spearman 
rank 
correlation 
coefficient, 
1-way 
analysis 
of 
variance 
(ANOVA) 
with 
continuous 
data 
stratified 
into 
quartiles 
or 
quintiles, 
and 
multivariate 
logistic 
regression 
to 
control 
for 
potential 
confounding. 
Fisher’s 
exact 
test 
was 
used 
to 
evaluate 
proportions.

The

was

(range, 
8

Four 
hundred 
twenty-nine 
(94%) 
of 
456 
patients 
had 
measurable 
snoring 
(snoring 
index 
1 
event

hour). 
Baseline 
snoring 
measurements 
are shown in Table 2. Age and sex were not associated with 
the 
snoring 
index, 
snoring 
loudness, 
snoring 
flutter 
frequency, 
or 
snoring 
type. 
BMI 
was 
directly 
associated 
with 
the 
snoring 
index 
(P 
. 
0.0457, 
1-way 
ANOVA 
of 
BMI 
tertile 
and 
snoring 
index). 
BMI 
was 
also 
directly 
associated 
with 
predominant 
palatal 
snoring 
defined 
as 
having 
70% 
or 
greater 
palatal 
snoring

Using 
the

for 
overweight 
(BMI

and 
obese 
(BMI

the

(246 
versus

Snoring 
and 
OSAHS 
Severity 


OSAHS diagnostic data are shown in Table 3. Due to the 
fact 
that 
the 
diagnostic 
criteria 
of 
OSAHS 
is 
controversial 
and 
that 
the 
SNAP 
test 
has 
not 
yet 
been 
conclusively 
validated 
in 
children, 
several 
different 
diagnostic 
criteria 
for 
OSAHS 
(AHI

were 
used 
in 
the 
analysis. 
Depending 
on 
the 
criteria 
used, 
the 
majority 
of 
patients 
were 
found 
to 
have 
OSAHS. 
This 
is 
not 
surprising 
given 
that

be 
very

“Significant

Thus,

DISCUSSION 


This 
study 
examines 
the 
relationship 
between 
objectively 
measured 
snoring 
and 
demographics 
such 
as 
age, 
sex, 
and 
BMI, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
relationship 
between 
objectively 
measured 
snoring 
and 
OSAHS 
severity. 
In 
addition, 
the 
relationship 
between 
snoring 
index 
and 
loudness 
and 
pulse 
oximetery 
desaturations 
was 
explored 
in 
patients 
without 
significant 
OSAHS 
(defined 
as 
having 
an 
AI 
1). 
No 
relationship 
was 
found 
between 
patient 
age 
or 
sex 
and 
snoring. 
Increasing 
BMI 
was 
associated 
with 
increasing 
overall 
snoring 
and 
palatal 
snoring. 
Snoring 
index 
and 
loudness 
were 
strongly 
associated 
with 
increasing 
OSAHS 
severity. 
Among 
patients 
with 
an 
AI 
1, 
an 
increase 
in 
snoring 
index 
and 
loudness 
were 
associated 
with 
an 
increase 
in 
pulse 
oximeter 
desaturations. 


One 
obvious 
weakness 
of 
this 
study 
is 
the 
lack 
of 
formal 
validation 
of 
the 
SNAP 
test 
vs 
overnight 
polysomnography 
in 
children. 
These 
data 
have 
been 
published 
in 
adults 
with 
an 
observed 
correlation 
coefficient 
of 
0.92 
between 
the 
SNAP Test AHI and simultaneous PSG AHI.6 Similar unpublished 
data 
for 
children 
exist 
that 
have 
been 
submitted 
for 
publication. 
(Personal 
communication, 
SNAP 
Labs 
Inc., 
September 
2006.) 
As 
mentioned 
previously, 
other 
published 
work7,8 has demonstrated that acoustic measurements correlate 
well 
with 
formal 
polysomnography 
in 
children. 
Certainly, 
overnight 
polysomnography 
remains 
the 
gold 
standard 
for 
the 
evaluation 
of 
pediatric 
sleep 
disordered 
breathing, 
but 
it 
would 
appear 
that 
sonography 
represents 
a 
reasonable 
home 
test 
equivalent. 
Another 
shortcoming 
of 
this 
study 
was 
the 
lack 
of 
data 
on 
the 
status 
of 
adenotonsillar 
tissue 
for 
the 
members 
of 
the 
cohort. 
The 
effect 
of 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy 
on 
objectively 
measured 
snoring 
is 
an 
intriguing 
question. 
We 
are 
considering 
a 
future 
study 
with 
this 
acoustical 
analysis 
technique 
to 
investigate 
this 
issue. 


This 
study 
objectively 
defines 
relationships 
between 
snoring 
and 
OSAHS 
that 
have 
been 
presumed 
and/or 
suspected 
qualitatively 
for 
some 
time. 
Common 
sense 
would 
conclude 
that 
as 
the 
quantity 
and 
loudness 
of 
snoring 
increases 
so 
would 
the 
risk 
of 
significant 
health 
impairment 
by 
way 
of 
OSAHS. 
Indeed, 
some 
studies 
have 
shown 
that 
parental 
reports 
of 
the 
quality 
and 
quantity 
of 
snoring 
have 
been 
correlated 
to 
PSG-derived 
objective 
findings 
of 
more 
severe levels of OSAHS.3 However, the issue has remained 
nebulous 
as 
other 
studies 
have 
contradicted 
this 
result 
by 
concluding 
that 
parental 
reports 
of 
the 
snoring/sleeping 
history 
are not predictive of objectively diagnosed OSAHS.9 
The 
current 
study 
clearly 
concludes 
that 
there 
is 
an 
objective 
trend of increasing snoring index (Table 4) and loud-
ness (Table 5) associated with increasing risk of OSAHS. 
However, 
the 
relationship 
is 
not 
pure; 
some 
patients 
who 
snore 
loudly 
and 
frequently 
did 
not 
have 
OSAHS 
and 
others 
who 
snore 
lightly 
do 
have 
OSAHS, 
which 
would 
explain 
the 
existence 
of 
contradictory 
reports 
in 
the 
literature. 
Regardless, 
it 
is 
clear 
from 
this 
study 
that 
patients 
with 
loud 
consistent 
snoring 
are 
at 
a 
significantly 
increased 
risk 
of

Pediatric 
snoring 
is 
increasingly 
being 
recognized 
as 
no 
longer 
harmless. 
Increasing 
concern 
surrounds 
the 
presence 
of 
pediatric 
snoring 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
OSHAS 
as 
potentially 
harmful 
to 
the 
delicate, 
developing 
pediatric 
central 
nervous 
system.1-4,10,11 The mechanism for this process is not completely 
known 
but 
is 
suspected 
to 
be 
via 
either 
from 
arousals 
that 
stem 
from 
snoring 
and 
partial 
airway 
obstruction 
and/or 
gas 
exchange 
abnormalities 
that 
may 
occur 
from 
snoring/ 
partial 
airway 
obstruction 
in 
the 
snoring 
child. 
This 
study 
clearly 
shows 
that 
increasing 
snoring 
index 
and 
increasing 
snoring 
volume 
are 
associated 
with 
increasing 
severity 
and 
frequency 
of 
pulse 
oximeter 
desaturations 
in 
patients 
without 
significant 
OSAHS. 
This 
strongly 
suggests 
that 
gas 
exchange 
abnormalities 
do 
occur 
in 
snoring 
children 
with 
increasing 
severity 
and 
frequency 
as 
snoring 
increases 
and 
could 
play 
a 
role 
in 
the 
observed 
neurobehavioral 
sequelae 
of 
pediatric 
snoring 
in 
at 
least 
some 
children. 
However, 
the 
process 
is 
not 
straightforward 
as 
other 
series 
have 
demonstrated 
that 
neurobehavioral 
impairments 
can 
be 
observed 
in 
snoring 
children 
without 
measured 
gas 
exchange 
abnormalities 
(ie, pulse oximeter desaturations).2 The mechanism in 
this 
case 
may 
be 
arousals 
and 
sleep 
architecture 
disruption. 
More 
study 
into 
this 
area 
is 
required 
to 
further 
elucidate 
this 
relationship. 


CONCLUSION 


The 
overwhelming 
majority 
of 
children 
referred 
for 
an 
evaluation 
of 
snoring 
and 
possible 
OSAHS 
had 
objectively 
measured 
snoring. 
BMI 
was 
associated 
with 
the 
snoring 
index 
and 
proportion 
of 
predominant 
palatal 
snoring. 
Snoring 
index 
and 
snoring 
loudness 
were 
associated 
with 
increasing 
OSAHS 
severity. 
Among 
patients 
without 
apneas, 
snoring 
index 
and 
loudness 
was 
associated 
with 
increasing 
frequency 
and 
severity 
of 
pulse 
oximeter 
desaturations.
