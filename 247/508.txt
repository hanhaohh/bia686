Study Objectives: To measure sympathetic responses in children with 
and without sleep-disordered breathing. 
Design: Prospective, observational study. 
Setting: Kosair Children’s Hospital Sleep Medicine and Apnea Center. 
Participants: Subjects were prospectively recruited from children undergoing 
overnight polysomnographic assessments and were retrospectively 
grouped according to the results of the polysomnogram. Sleep-disordered 
breathing was defined as an apnea-hypopnea index >5 and children were 
assigned to the control group if their apnea-hypopnea index was < 1. 
Intervention: N/A. 
Measurements and Results: During quiet wakefulness, pulse arterial 
tonometry was used to assess changes in sympathetic activity following 
vital capacity sighs in 28 children with sleep-disordered breathing and 29 
controls. Each child underwent a series of 3 sighs, and the average maximal 
pulse arterial tonometry signal attenuation was calculated. Further, a 
cold pressor test was conducted in a subset of 14 children with sleep-disordered 
breathing and 14 controls. The left hand was immersed in ice cold 
water for 30 seconds while right-hand pulse arterial tonometry signal was

hypertension and ischemic heart disease.1-6 Although the mechanisms 
that mediate cardiovascular morbidity in adults with SDB 
are poorly understood, autonomic nervous system dysfunction is 
believed to play a key role.7 It is likely that both intermittent hypoxia 
and increased arousals mediate the elevation in sympathetic 
nerve activity that results in altered vasomotor tone regulation. 
Indeed, recurrent hypoxemia, associated with mild hypercapnia, 
and increased chemoreceptor firing all lead to increased muscle 
sympathetic nerve activity and increased blood pressure.8 In addition, 
arousals during sleep will directly activate the sympathetic 
nervous system with a resultant pressor response.9 Although the

Signal amplitude changes were expressed as percentage change 
from corresponding baseline. 
Results: The magnitude of sympathetic discharge-induced attenuation 
of pulse arterial tonometry signal was significantly increased in children 
with sleep-disordered breathing during sigh maneuvers (74.1%±10.7% 
change compared with 59.2%±13.2% change in controls; P<.0001) and 
the cold pressor test (83.5%±7.3% change compared with 74.1%±11.4% 
change in controls; P=.039). Further, recovery kinetics in control children 
were faster than those of children with sleep-disordered breathing. 
Conclusion: Children with sleep-disordered breathing have altered autonomic 
nervous system regulation as evidenced by increased sympathetic 
vascular reactivity during wakefulness.

effect of SDB on the autonomic nervous system in childhood has 
not been systematically investigated, it is likely that autonomic 
nervous system dysfunction is also present in some children, albeit 
to a lesser degree than in adults.10,11 

A recently developed technique allowing for noninvasive moment-
to-moment measurement of sympathetic tone is peripheral 
arterial tonometry, (PAT, Itamar Medical, Caesarea, Israel).12 PAT 
has been previously well described and employs a finger plethysmographic 
approach that eliminates venous pulsations and 
continuously measures the arterial pulse waveform of the digit. 
PAT continuously measures the pulsatile volume change using a 
pneumo-optic probe, which reflects the relative change of blood 
volume in the finger. Changes in sympathetic nervous system activity, 
which are mediated by alpha adrenoreceptor activation, result 
in episodic vasoconstriction of the digital vascular beds with 
corresponding attenuation of PAT signal.13,14 Thus, increases in 
sympathetic activity will elicit robust changes in peripheral vascular 
cutaneous perfusion and can be readily detected on a beat-
to-beat basis. In adults, PAT is exquisitely sensitive to changes 
in sympathetic autonomic nervous system activity.12 The purpose 
of this study was, therefore, to investigate dynamic responses of 
the sympathetic autonomic nervous system in children with and 
without SDB. 

METHODS 

Subjects were prospectively recruited from children being 
evaluated for potential SDB at Kosair Children’s Hospital Sleep 
Medicine Center. In addition, healthy children with no reports of 
sleep disturbance were also recruited from a community-based 
survey to act as controls. The study was approved by the University 
of Louisville Human Research Committee. Parental in

formed consent and child assent, in the presence of a parent, were 
obtained. Children were excluded if they had any chronic medical 
condition, received medications known to alter autonomic nervous 
system function, or had any psychiatric diagnoses or any genetic 
or craniofacial syndromes. All children underwent a standard 
overnight multichannel polysomnographic evaluation in the sleep 
laboratory to confirm the presence or absence of SDB rather than 
rely on parental report. No drugs were used to induce sleep. The 
following parameters were measured: chest and abdominal wall 
movement by respiratory impedance or inductance plethysmography; 
heart rate by electrocardiogram; air flow was monitored with 
a sidestream end-tidal capnograph, which also provided breathby-
breath assessment of end-tidal carbon-dioxide levels (BCI SC300, 
Menomonee Falls, Wisc); and a thermistor. The SpO2 was assessed 
by pulse oximetry (Nellcor N 100; Nellcor Inc., Hayward, 
Calif), with simultaneous recording of the pulse waveform. The 
bilateral electrooculogram, 8 channels of electroencephalogram, 
chin and anterior tibial electromyograms, and analog output from 
a body position sensor (Braebon Medical Corporation, NY) were 
also monitored. All measures were digitized using a commercially 
available polysomnography system (Rembrandt, MedCare Diagnostics, 
Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Tracheal sound was monitored 
with a microphone sensor (Sleepmate, Virg), and a digital 
time-synchronized video recording was performed. 

Sleep architecture was assessed by standard techniques.15 Obstructive 
apnea was defined as the absence of airflow with continued 
chest-wall and abdominal movement for duration of at 
least 2 breaths.16,17 Hypopneas were defined as a decrease in nasal 
flow of at least 50% with a corresponding decrease in SpO2 of at 
least 4%, an arousal, or both a decrease in SpO2 and an arousal.17 
The obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was defined as the 
number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of total sleep time. 
Children with an AHI of 5 or more per hour of total sleep time 
were considered to have SDB, whereas children without a history 
of snoring and an AHI less than 1 were considered to be controls. 
The mean SpO2, as measured by pulse oximetry, in the presence 
of a pulse waveform signal void of motion artifact and the SpO2 
nadir were recorded. Since criteria for arousals have not yet been 
developed for children, arousals were defined as recommended 
by the American Sleep Disorders Association Task Force report18 
using the 3-second rule, the presence of movement arousal, or 
both.19 Arousals were divided into 2 main subtypes: spontaneous 
arousals and respiratory arousals. 

Immediately prior to initiation of the polysomnographic recordings, 
PAT was used to assess changes in sympathetic activity 
during quiet wakefulness. The PAT probe was placed on the right 
hand of each child, and both raw and filtered PAT signals were 
digitally acquired and incorporated into the polysomnographic 
montage. Each child sat up on the bed with both hands resting on 
a table in front of him or her. Baseline PAT measurements were 
obtained when the child was sitting quietly and the PAT signal 
was steady for at least 2 minutes. Baseline values were obtained 
by taking the mean measurement across a 10-second period of 
steady, good-quality signal. Following baseline measures, each 
child underwent a series of 3 vital capacity sighs, each separated 
by at least 60 seconds of normal breathing wherein the PAT signal 
remained steady and artifact free. The maximal attenuation 
of PAT signal was measured over 10 seconds and calculated as a 
percentage change from baseline. Measurements were averaged 
over the series of sighs. Figure 1 illustrates a PAT attenuation associated 
with a sigh. 

A subgroup of children also underwent a cold pressor test 5 
minutes after the series of sighs. This subgroup comprised all

children recruited to the study following the addition of the pressor 
test to the challenge protocol. The left hand was immersed 
in ice-cold water for 30 seconds while the right hand remained 
still. PAT signal was continuously monitored throughout the immersion 
and recovery periods. Changes in signal amplitude were 
calculated by averaging the mean amplitude over a 10-second 
period before the pressor test (baseline), during the pressor test 
(challenge), immediately following the removal of the hand from 
the water (post challenge), and then at 1-minute intervals during 
the 20-minute recovery phase. All measures were obtained from 
a steady and regular artifact-free PAT signal. Amplitudes were 
expressed as percentage change from corresponding baseline. 

All maneuvers were performed at least 3 hours following ingestion 
of food or caffeine, since these variables may confound 
the results. In addition, ambient temperature remained constant 
throughout the assessments. 

Data Analysis 

All data were coded and analyzed blind to the subject group 
upon completion of recruitment. Data are presented as means ± 
SD and 95% confidence intervals (CI) unless otherwise indicated. 
Independent t tests were employed for comparisons of measures 
between the study groups, with the Fischer Exact Test used for 
dichotomous outcomes. For the cold pressor test, an analysis of 
variance with repeated measures was employed. All P values reported 
are 2 sided with statistical significance set at <.05. 

RESULTS 

Children were retrospectively grouped according to the results 
of the overnight polysomnogram. A total of 28 children (14 boys) 
were found to have SDB, whereas 29 children (19 boys) were 
designated as controls. Of these, 14 children in each group participated 
in the cold pressor test. Table 1 illustrates the demographic 
information for the 2 groups.

Sigh Maneuvers 

The mean magnitude of sympathetic-induced attenuation of 
the PAT signal following a sigh is illustrated in Figure 2. Children 
with SDB showed significantly greater attenuation as 
compared with control children; mean attenuation from baseline 
was 74.1%±10.7% (95% CI 70.1%-78.1%) compared with 
59.2%±13.2% in controls (95% CI 54.4%-64.0%; P<.0001). No 
differences were observed between boys and girls. 

Cold Pressor Test 

The magnitude of sympathetic-induced attenuation of the PAT 
signal during the cold pressor test showed that children with 
SDB had greater attenuation than controls; 83.5%±7.3% (95% 
CI 79.7%-87.3%) compared with 74.1%±11.4% (95% CI 68.1%80.1%) 
respectively; P=.039. Furthermore, the recovery dynamics 
of the control children were faster than those of children with 
SDB (Figure 3), with the control children demonstrating a return 
to baseline within 4 minutes, compared with 10 minutes for children 
with SDB (P=.018). 

The degree of PAT attenuation in either of the 2 challenges 
above was not correlated with the severity of SDB. 

DISCUSSION 

The major finding of this study is that children with SDB 
demonstrate altered autonomic function compared with children 
without SDB, as evidenced by alterations in vascular reactivity. 
While substantial evidence has accumulated over the last decades 
to show that adults with SDB have increased sympathetic nervous 
system activity compared with that of controls, information on 
this issue is markedly scant in children. The present study, utilizing 
PAT as a marker of sympathetic activation, extends the observation 
on increased sympathetic activity in SDB to the pediatric 
age range.

strength of the present study is that all children underwent polysomnographic 
evaluation, and only children with confirmed SDB 
(ie, AHI>5) were included in the SDB group. Furthermore, control 
children were recruited from a community sample of healthy 
children. All children identified as controls also underwent polysomnographic 
assessment to confirm the absence of SDB. Furthermore, 
SDB and control groups were similar with respect to 
age, sex distribution, and body mass index. Nonetheless, children 
with mild SDB (ie, AHI 1-5) were not included in this cohort, 
and, therefore, further studies will be required in order to determine 
whether PAT technology has clinical application in the full 
spectrum of SDB. In the current study, we used 2 simple noninvasive 
strategies, namely vital capacity sighs and the cold pressor 
test, to perturb sympathetic activity and elicit a stereotypic response. 
The sympathetic nervous system regulates the peripheral 
vasculature in the limbs,20 and a deep breath causes vasoconstriction 
in the extremities that is sympathetically mediated21 and is 
blocked by the a-receptor antagonist phentolamine. Furthermore, 
the cold pressor test is a classic vasconstrictive stimulus that also 
induces an a-adrenoreceptor-mediated vasoconstriction in the 
peripheral vasculature22 and a rise in total peripheral resistance. 
Increased sympathetic tone can be identified with PAT technology 
as a corresponding attenuation of the PAT signal, with greater 
sympathetic activity resulting in greater signal attenuation.12,23-25 
Thus, the implementation of PAT technology in the assessment 
of moment-to-moment changes in sympathetic vasomotor tone 
is novel and permitted accurate noninvasive determination of the 
sympathetic responses in children. 

Although the mechanisms that link cardiovascular disease and 
SDB in adults are not fully understood, sustained and aberrant 
autonomic activation, endothelial dysfunction, and inflammation 
have all been implicated in the increased prevalence and severity 
of cardiovascular morbidity associated with SDB.5,6,8,9,26 Such 
studies are clearly lacking in the pediatric arena. Nevertheless, 
few studies exist in children with SDB. In 1997 Aljadeff and colleagues10 
examined heart-rate variability (a noninvasive probe of 
autonomic nervous system tone) in a small group of children with 
moderate to severe SDB compared with that of matched controls.

vealed increases in sympathetic activity throughout, as well as 
increased vagal discharge during, respiratory events. Similarly, 
Baharav et al11 found evidence for increased sympathetic tone 
as derived from spectral analysis of cardiac periodicities in children 
with SDB. Moreover, an index of overall autonomic balance 
was computed for each subject and was found to correlate well 
with the respiratory disturbance index. Our study provides further 
evidence for the occurrence of increased sympathetic tone 
during wakefulness in pediatric SDB, as evidenced by more-pronounced 
PAT signal attenuations during both the vital-capacity 
sighs and the cold pressor tests. Furthermore, children with SDB 
took significantly more time to return to baseline following the 
cold pressor test, suggesting the presence of either altered vascular 
reactivity or the inability to down regulate obstructive sleep 
apnea-associated sympathetic hyperactivation following a challenge 
in this group. 

Modifications in autonomic function may alter the diurnal control 
and variability of blood pressure. Indeed, in adult patients as 
well as in animal studies, repetitive apneic events not only induce 
elevation of systemic blood pressure with each apnea, but also 
induce a more prolonged elevation of blood pressure that extends 
beyond the apneic period.27 The magnitude and severity of blood 
pressure elevation in pediatric patients with SDB are not as prominent 
as those described for older patients, presumably as a result 
of the increased vascular compliance in the pediatric age range. 
Nevertheless, elevations of blood pressure do occur, as shown by 
elevations in systolic, diastolic, or systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure compared with that of control populations.28-30 In a more 
recent study by Amin and colleagues,31 pediatric SDB patients 
exhibited altered state-dependent circadian blood pressure regulation 
during both sleep and wakefulness, suggesting that alterations 
in autonomic nervous system control of blood pressure will 
manifest as increased variability in blood pressure values rather 
than emerge as a sustained elevation in blood pressure values. 

The exact pathophysiology of autonomic nervous system dysfunction 
in the context of SDB is still not completely elucidated. 
However, autonomic alterations are likely mediated by both the 
episodic hypoxia that may accompany SDB, as well as by the repeated 
arousals and carbon dioxide elevations of this condition. It 

is also likely that the persistent enhancements in sympathetic activity 
associated with SDB will facilitate elevation of pulmonary 
artery pressures,32,33 as well as left ventricular hypertrophy and 
abnormal ventricular geometry resulting from persistent increases 
in systemic vascular resistance.34 Indeed, enhanced sympathoadrenal 
discharge, altered homeostasis of the renin-angiotensin and 
of the renal kallikrein-kallistatin pathways, and heightened sympathetic 
autonomic nervous system tone occur with SDB along 
with increases in small arteriolar vasomotor contractility suggestive 
of endothelial dysfunction.35-45 The increased sympathetic 
activation associated with SDB in children could be also mediated 
from initiation and propagation of inflammatory responses 
within the microvasculature. C-reactive protein, an important 
serum marker of inflammation, has emerged as one of the most 
powerful independent predictors of risk for future cardiovascular 
morbidity.46-48 In adults with SDB, elevated levels of C-reactive 
protein have been found and correlate with the severity of SDB.26 
Elevated C-reactive protein levels decrease following treatment 
with CPAP,49 suggesting that SDB leads to inflammatory responses 
that ultimately may promote cardiovascular complications. In a 
recent study, we reported on our preliminary evidence indicating 
that C-reactive protein levels are also elevated in children with 
SDB and are correlated with disease severity.50 

The long-term implications of persistently elevated sympathetic 
tone on cardiovascular morbidity during later stages of 
childhood or even adulthood have yet to be explored. It also 
remains unclear whether untreated or long-lasting SDB will be 
associated with vascular remodeling of the pulmonary circulation 
in these children. Evidence from animal models exposed to 
hypoxia for a short period of time during early postnatal life reveals 
that pulmonary hypertension is increased when exposed to 
hypoxia later in infancy.51 These authors speculated that disrupted 
alveolarization and vascular growth following the brief hypoxic 
insult during a critical period of development may increase the 
risk for severe pulmonary hypertension later in life. Moreover, in 
preliminary animal experiments, when rodents were exposed to a 
model of obstructive sleep apnea52 at an age corresponding to the 
peak prevalence of pediatric SDB in childhood, marked attenuation 
of their baroreceptor function lasting into late adulthood was 
found.53 Thus, early childhood perturbations may lead to lifelong 
consequences, or, in other words, certain types of adult cardiovascular 
disease may represent, at least in part, sequelae from a 
priori “unrelated events” during childhood. Therefore, identification 
of children with alterations of baroreceptor and autonomic 
nervous system function in the context of pediatric SDB may lead 
to detection of a population potentially at risk for development 
of hypertension and of other cardiovascular-associated morbidities. 
While the reversibility and overall long-term implications of 
the increased sympathetic responses in children with SDB remain 
unknown, our findings provide, for the first time, conclusive evidence 
that persistent waking-associated autonomic nervous system 
dysfunction is present among children with SDB and further 
support the notion supporting early diagnosis and treatment in 
such children.
