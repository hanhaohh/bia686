Study objectives: The Tucson Children’s Assessment of Sleep Apnea (TuCASA) study is designed 
to investigate the prevalence and correlates of objectively measured sleep-disordered breathing 
(SDB) in preadolescent children. This article describes the parental report of sleep symptoms 
associated with SDB in Hispanic and white children. 
Design: A 13-question sleep habits screening questionnaire designed to assess the severity of 
sleep-related symptoms associated with SDB in children 4 to 11 years of age. 
Setting: Questionnaires were completed by the parents of children attending elementary school 
in the Tucson Unified School District, Tucson, AZ. 
Participants: There were 1,494 questionnaires returned, which comprised a sample of whites 
(38%), Hispanics (45%), and other races (17%). Of these questionnaires, 1,214 were returned for 
the children of white (45.8%; 556 children) or Hispanic (54.2%; 658 children) ethnicity only. The 
primary analysis was completed on these 613 boys (50.5%) and 601 girls (49.5%). 
Results: In the total sample of 1,494 children, parents were more likely to report excessive 
daytime sleepiness (EDS) in female children than in male children (p < .01), however, this 
association did not achieve significance in the sample of only white and Hispanic children 
(p < .07). Composite variables for EDS and witnessed apnea (WITAP) show that parents of 
Hispanic children were more likely to report EDS (p < .01) and WITAP (p < .007). Hispanic 
children were also more likely to have learning problems (LPs) [p < .03] and to snore frequently 
(SN) [p < .02] than were white children. There were no significant differences between boys and 
girls for SN or WITAP. Hispanic boys were more likely to have reports of EDS (p < .02) and LPs 
(p < .04) than white boys, however, there were no other significant differences in gender or 
ethnicity in reports of EDS or LPs for white or Hispanic boys and girls. Those children with 
frequent LPs were significantly more likely to have SN (p < .001), EDS (p < .001), and WITAP 
(p < .001). A logistic regression model predicting LP resulted in significant adjusted odds ratios 
(ORs) of 2.4 for SN, 2.5 for EDS, and 2.1 for children aged 8 to 11 years. A similar model for EDS 
resulted in significant adjusted ORs of 3.2 for SN, 5.7 for WITAP, and 1.6 for female gender. 
Ethnicity was not significant in either model. 
Conclusions: Hispanic children in the population-based TuCASA study experienced more 
frequent symptoms associated with SDB, such as SN, EDS, WITAP, and LPs, than did white 
children. Children with LPs are 2.4 times more likely to have SN, 2.5 times more likely to have 
EDS, and were 2.1 times more likely to be between the ages of 8 and 11 years. Children with EDS 
were 3.2 times more likely to have SN, 5.7 times more likely to have WITAP, and were 1.6 times 
more likely to be a girl. (CHEST 2003; 124:196–203)

here is increasing recognition that sleep disturbances 
and snoring are important factors in 
childhood development. Sleep-disordered breathing 
(SDB) including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome 
(OSAS) is acknowledged as an important 
cause of morbidity in children. Clinical symptoms of 
OSAS in children include daytime sleepiness, snoring, 
restlessness during sleep, hyperactivity, nocturnal 
arousals, and enuresis.1– 4 Evidence also suggests 
that the adverse effects of frequent nighttime arousals 
include learning, behavioral, and personality 
problems.5–8 A recent review of evidence9 has shown 
an almost threefold increase in behavioral and neurocognitive 
abnormalities in children with SDB. 

Snoring in children has been associated with daytime 
sleepiness, restless sleep, and hyperactivity, and 
is an indicator for the presence of OSA.10–13 Despite 
the fact that no definitive epidemiologic study to 
determine the prevalence of OSA in children has 
been done, estimates range from 1 to 3%.12,14 –16 
This would place an estimated 320,000 of the 
32 million children between 6 and 11 years old in the 
United States at risk for adverse health consequences 
due to OSA.17 

Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) occurs less 
frequently in children with OSAS than in adults with 
OSAS.18,19 This may occur because children with 
OSAS are less prone than adults to develop sleep 
fragmentation.20,21 In addition, EDS in children 
tends to occur mostly among those who are more 
obese or have severe OSAS.19 Cross-sectional studies4,22 
have reported EDS ranging from 8 to 62% of 
children with OSAS, thus, estimates of the prevalence 
of EDS in children at risk for OSAS vary 
substantially. 

The American Thoracic Society has stated23,24 that 
the assessment of OSAS in children is important 
work that needs to be extended to include a larger 
number of children from different risk groups. One 
study15 showed an increased risk of OSAS for African-
American children, however, no studies have 
been performed to examine the risk of OSAS for

Hispanic children. The year 2000 US census25 shows 
that the Hispanic population increased 50% from 
1990 to 2000, with Hispanics accounting for 12.5% 
of the US population. An estimated 4 million Hispanic 
children from 6 to 11 years of age currently live 
in the United States,26 therefore, estimates of the 
prevalence of symptoms associated with OSAS in 
Hispanic children are becoming essential. Many 
reports of sleep symptoms that are indicative of 
OSAS occur in clinical or small samples, therefore, it 
would be useful to determine the prevalence of these 
conditions in a population-based sample of children 
and to assess whether there are differences between 
Hispanic and white children. 

The Tucson Children’s Assessment of Sleep Apnea 
(TuCASA) study is a prospective cohort study 
that was designed to determine the prevalence of 
objectively documented SDB in preadolescent children 
and to investigate its relationship to symptoms, 
performance on neurobehavioral measures, and 
physiologic and anatomic risk factors. This report 
describes the prevalence of reported symptoms associated 
with SDB in Hispanic and white children 
obtained while screening children for home polysomnography 
in the TuCASA study. 

Materials and Methods 

The design of the TuCASA study specified the recruitment of 
Hispanic and white children aged 6 through 11 years to undergo 
unattended home polysomnography, to complete a pediatric 
sleep-habits questionnaire, and to perform a neurocognitive 
assessment.27 Recruitment was accomplished by soliciting the 
cooperation of selected elementary schools in the Tucson Unified 
School District (TUSD). TUSD is a very large district with an 
elementary school population that is representative of children 
living in southern Arizona. To ensure that an adequate number of 
Hispanic children were surveyed and recruited for polysomnography, 
elementary schools were contacted that had a larger 
proportion of Hispanic children than white children. The population 
of the schools recruited was 33.7% white vs 52.5% 
Hispanic, to achieve approximately equal participation of Hispanic 
and white children. 

Typically, a short sleep-habits screening questionnaire was sent 
home with children in a “notes home” folder. Parents were asked 
to complete the questions and to provide their contact information 
if they agreed to allow study personnel to call and schedule 
a polysomnogram for their child. Because we sent questionnaires 
home to all children attending a school targeted for recruitment, 
some questionnaires (292 questionnaires; 19%) were received 
from schoolchildren who were below the recruitment window for 
polysomnography of 6 years of age. However, these questionnaires 
were accepted and included in this analysis since we kept 
all questionnaires from children who would have the potential to 
complete polysomnography before the end of data collection. In 
order to maximize parent participation, a letter of endorsement 
from the principal of the school was included with the screening 
questionnaire. Incentives such as pizza parties were provided to 
classrooms that returned the highest number of screening questionnaires. 
Additionally, an honorarium based on the percentage

of questionnaires returned was given to the school in order to 
encourage maximum response from all students. 

The screening questionnaire is a one-page, English/Spanish 
survey designed to assess the severity of sleep-related symptoms 
in addition to requesting demographic information such as 
ethnicity, age, and gender. The survey was forward-translated 
and backward-translated into Spanish, then it was pilot tested 
prior to implementation for Spanish-speaking parents. Parents 
were asked to answer 13 questions pertaining to their child’s 
sleep habits (Appendix). These questions were evaluated by the 
parent on the scale of “never,”“rarely,”“occasionally,”“frequently,”“
almost always,”or “don’t know.”Parents were encouraged to 
answer the 13 questions and to return the survey even if they 
wished to provide little or no other demographic information. 
The questionnaire informed the parent that we would complete 
sleep studies on approximately 300 children, but it did not give 
any information about the purpose of the research. The complete 
list of survey questions is provided in the “Appendix.” 

Composite variables were created based on a combination of 
some of the survey items. Subjects were classified as having EDS 
if the parent reported that their child was sleepy in the daytime, 
fell asleep while watching TV or in school “frequently”or more. 
Witnessed apnea (WITAP) was present if the parent reported 
that their child stopped or struggled to breathe, their child’s lips 
turned blue, or they shook their child because they were worried 
about their child’s breathing during sleep “frequently”or more. 
Snoring was present if parents reported their child snored loudly 
“frequently”or “almost always”(SN). The child was classified as 
having learning problems (LPs) if the parent reported them 
“frequently”or more. 

Statistical analysis was done using a statistical software package 
(SPSS, version 11.0 for Windows; SPSS, Inc; Chicago, IL). 
Comparisons of proportions were based on contingency tables. 
Statistical significance (p . 
0.05) was determined using the 
Pearson 2 test. Logistic regression was used to model those 
variables found to be significant during an exploratory bivariate 
analysis. Cronbach . 
was used to model the internal consistency 
of the screening survey for reliability analysis. 

Results 

Of the 4,880 screening questionnaires that were 
sent home, a total of 1,494 were returned, for a 
response rate of 30.6%. The return rate was similar 
for boys and girls (49.7% and 49.4%, respectively), 
and was higher for Hispanics than for whites (45.4% 

and 38.1%, respectively). Other ethnicities comprised 
16.6% (247 surveys) of the surveys. As shown 
in Table 1, from a sample of 1,481 children reporting 
gender and race, the prevalence of SN was 10.5%. 
The percentages of parents reporting EDS and 
WITAP in their children were 8.1% and 3.8%, 
respectively. The parents of girls were more likely to 
report EDS than those of boys (9.9% vs 6.3%, 
respectively; p . 
0.01). However, the prevalences of 
reported SN, WITAP, and LP did not differ between 
boys and girls. 

A date of birth was reported on 1,416 of the 1,494 
returned questionnaires. There were 763 children 
(53.9%) who were between 4 years and 7 years of 
age, and 653 children (46.1%) who were between 
8 years and 11 years of age. No significant differences 
were found between age categories for SN 
(10.7% vs 10.4%, respectively; p . 
0.05), EDS (8.5% 
vs 7.7%, respectively; p . 
0.05), or WITAP (3.3% vs 
3.8%, respectively; p . 
0.05). However, the prevalence 
of LPs in children 8 to 11 years old was higher 
than that observed in those 4 to 7 years old (7.2% vs 
3.8%, respectively; p . 
0.01). Further analysis 
showed that this effect was more evident among 
older girls (ie, 8 to 11 years of age, 6.3%; 4 to 7 years 
of age, 2.5%; p . 
0.02) than among older boys (ie, 
8 to 11 years of age, 8.1%; 4 to 7 years of age, 5.0%; 
p . 
0.12). 

Of the 1,494 surveys, 1,247 reported white or 
Hispanic ethnicity (83.4%). We restricted further 
analyses to this sample due to the small number of 
children with other ethnicities in Tucson elementary 
schools and because the primary focus of the 
TuCASA study was SDB in Hispanic and white 
children. Table 1 shows the reported prevalence of 
symptoms for Hispanic and white children as well as 
gender differences. The parents of Hispanic children 
were more likely to report SN than were those 
of white children (11.4% vs 7.4%, respectively; 
p . 
0.02), as well as being more likely to report EDS

(9.6% vs 5.8%, respectively; p . 
0.01) and WITAP 
(4.7% vs 1.9%, respectively; p . 
0.007). Hispanic 
children were also more likely to have LPs than 
were white children (6.5% vs 3.7%, respectively; 
p . 
0.03). This observation was a result of there 
being more LPs seen in Hispanic boys than in white 
boys (8.2% vs 4.0%, respectively; p . 
0.03). No 
difference was found in LPs between Hispanic and 
white girls. 

An examination of the sleep-habits screening 
questionnaire was undertaken to see whether the 
increased symptoms reported by Hispanic parents 
could be due to translation anomalies. Hispanic 
parents had the option of completing the questionnaire 
in either English or Spanish. Questions completed 
by the parents of Hispanic children were 
analyzed to see whether these differences were 
dependent on the language version of the questionnaire 
that was completed. For all composite variables, 
there were no statistically significant differences 
in Hispanic reports regardless of whether the 
English or Spanish translations were used. On each 
individual question that comprised the composite 
variables, there were also no statistically significant 
differences for those reporting symptoms frequently 
or more often. The only question that was used in 
this report that showed a statistically significant 
difference between questionnaire versions within 
those reporting Hispanic ethnicity was “How often 
does your child snore loudly.” Hispanic parents 
completing the questionnaire in Spanish (333 parents) 
were more likely to report that their child 

snored loudly than were Hispanic parents completing 
the questionnaire in English (13.8% vs 9.0%, 
respectively; p . 
0.05). Finally, the internal consistency 
of the questionnaire was found to be satisfactory 
with a Cronbach . 
of 0.768, which is a level that 
remained similar regardless of whether the questionnaire 
was completed in Spanish or English, or 
whether by white or Hispanic parents. 

In addition to the higher prevalence of LPs in 
Hispanics and in older children, LPs were significantly 
associated with SN, EDS, and WITAP (Fig 1). 
However, there was no overall relationship between 
LPs and gender. As shown in Table 2, additional 
stratified analyses were conducted to further explore 
the association of LPs with SN, EDS, and WITAP as 
a function of ethnicity and gender. LPs remained 
associated with these symptoms across ethnicity and 
gender categories, although, in a few cases, statistical 
significance was not quite achieved. 

The prevalence rates of EDS as a function of SN, 
WITAP, gender, and age are shown in Figure 2. In 
addition to a greater prevalence in Hispanics, EDS 
was more common in those children with SN and 
WITAP. In this analysis, which was restricted to 
whites and Hispanics only, EDS also was more 
common in girls than in boys (9.3% vs 6.5%, respectively), 
although statistical significance was not 
achieved (p . 
0.07). Thus, it is consistent with the 
same analysis performed in the sample of children 
with all ethnicities (see above). No differences were 
noted between older and younger children. 

SN was highly associated with WITAP (17.9 vs 1.8,

Logistic regression was used to model LPs with 
those variables found to be associated in the exploratory

ratio (OR) for SN was 2.4 (95% confidence interval

adjusted OR for age 8 to 11 years was 2.1 (95% CI, 

1.2 to 3.5; p .

were not significant in this model. A similar model 
was constructed to predict EDS, which showed an 
adjusted OR for SN of 3.2 (95% CI, 1.8 to 5.5; 
p .

ethnicity was not significant. 

Discussion 

The TuCASA study has demonstrated that children 
with LPs who are between 4 years and 11 years 
of age were significantly more likely to have a 
parental report of SN and EDS. Also, children with 
EDS were much more likely to have SN and

WITAP, and to be female. Additionally, the parents 
of Hispanic children reported significantly more 
EDS, WITAP, and SN in their children than did 
white parents. Furthermore, Hispanic boys were 
more likely to have reports of EDS and LPs than 
were Hispanic girls or whites of both genders. 
Finally, the parents of children of all ethnicities were 
significantly more likely to report frequent daytime 
sleepiness in girls than in boys. 

LPs were consistently and significantly associated 
with EDS, SN, WITAP, and all of their component 
variables, regardless of gender or ethnicity. Although 
LPs are frequently reported in clinical studies that 
include patients with confirmed SDB, few studies 
have shown that LPs are common in a general 
population across gender and ethnicity for those 
children with reported EDS, WITAP, and SN. Our 
findings were similar to those of Gozal et al,28 who 
reported that SN during early childhood resulted in 
an OR of 2.79 for those children with LPs vs those 
with no LPs, a result that is very similar to that of the 
TuCASA study (OR, 2.4). These associations were 
highly significant in this sample, however, we were 
not able to control for variables known to be associated 
with LPs, such as socioeconomic status or 
parent education. Because our sample included Hispanic 
children in schools in which a large proportion 
of the population are in low income census tracts 
and/or eligible for reduced lunch programs, it is 
possible that these LPs are magnified due to other 
social problems. In several of the TUSD schools in 
our sample, English-as-a-second-language programs 
are employed as part of the curriculum for those 
students in grades 1 to 3 who may not be US citizens 
or speak English fluently. Although teaching is done 
in both English and Spanish for these children until 
they are assimilated into full English-speaking 
classes, it is possible that Hispanic parents may 
perceive a LP in a child who does not speak fluent 
English. However, not only Hispanics, but also 
whites with reported LPs were more likely to have 
EDS, WITAP, and SN. Finally, our assessment of 
LPs was based on the answer to one question on the 
screening survey, therefore, parental report could be 
subject to interpretation or cultural bias. We realize 
that LPs constitute a broad area that encompasses 
issues with scholastic performance and class discipline 
as well as interactions with the home learning 
environment. 

Several studies7,15,28,29 have reported the prevalence 
of sleep problems, suggestive of SDB in a 
population-based sample of children. Our overall 
snoring prevalence of 10.5% is within the upper end 
of the range reported by others.13,29,30 Snoring rates 
in these studies vary considerably depending on the 
questionnaire wording and the definition used for 

www.chestjournal.org 

ascertainment. There are fewer epidemiologic studies 
that have reported the prevalence of WITAP and 
EDS.11,31 However, our overall WITAP prevalence 
rate of 3.8% is comparable to that of previous 
studies11,14 despite differences in questionnaire 
wording. We observed that EDS was present in 8.1% 
of our children, which is approximately twice the 
prevalence observed by Camhi et al32 in a different 
cohort of Tucson children but is similar to that 
observed by others.33,34 Like the other sleep apnea 
symptoms that we assessed, the comparison of our 
EDS prevalence to other studies is difficult because 
of differences in the definition of EDS. For example, 
in the study by Camhi et al,32 “excessive daytime 
sleepiness” was the only symptom used to define 
EDS. In contrast, in our study, EDS was present if 
there was parental report of one of three symptoms 
of “sleepiness.” Thus, it is not surprising that our 
reported prevalence rate of EDS is higher than those 
of previous studies. Other studies of children in this 
age group have not reported the gender difference in 
parental report of EDS that we found in this sample. 
Given the limited amount of information obtained 
on our screening survey, a plausible explanation for 
the higher prevalence of EDS in girls is not readily 
available. 

There are no previous studies documenting the 
prevalence of sleep symptoms associated with OSA 
in Hispanic children. However, our findings are 
consistent with the few reports comparing sleep 
symptoms in Hispanic adolescents and adults to 
other ethnic groups. A study by Roberts et al35 
reported a higher prevalence of insomnia and hypersomnia 
in Mexican-American youths (in grades 6, 7, 
and 8) compared to that in white youths. Hicks et al36 
found that Hispanic college students were more 
likely to be dissatisfied with their sleep quality than 
were white college students. Therefore, it might be 
expected that the parents of young Hispanic children 
would also report a higher prevalence of OSAS-
associated symptoms. Although it cannot be excluded 
that differences between Hispanic and white 
children are due to translation irregularities, the 
consistency of reporting within the Hispanic group, 
regardless of whether the Spanish or English version 
was used, would argue that the differences are not 
due to translation problems. 

Some studies20,37,38 have found that hyperactivity 
and other types of neurobehavioral abnormalities 
are common in children with reports of SDB, 
whereas EDS is unusual. In addition, a Finnish 
study11 found that the absence of excessive sleepiness 
was protective against OSAS in children. 
However, this study supports the contention that 
children also experience EDS as a result of 

SDB.12,13,33,34 

Furthermore, the presence of SN

and WITAP were found to be predictive of those 
children with EDS, a finding that supports the 
premise that symptoms associated with SDB can 
be used to predict EDS. 

Although the specific range and order of questions 
used in the TuCASA screening questionnaire have 
not been validated previously, most are standard 
questions that are seen on sleep-habits questionnaires 
pertaining to SDB in children. The subsequent 
composite variables also have not been systematically 
validated, although they do have face 
validity. A conscientious decision to limit the number 
and breadth of questions was made in order to keep 
the questionnaire short in hopes that this would 
encourage maximum response on essential items 
related to SDB. This was done with the knowledge 
that further questionnaires would be administered to 
those parents and children who were recruited for 
polysomnography. 

It is possible that selection bias occurred if parents 
who believed that their children had a sleep problem 
were more likely to return the completed questionnaire. 
Efforts to reduce this bias were made by giving 
incentives for classroom and whole-school participation, 
as well as allowing the parent to return the 
survey anonymously. The prevalence of symptoms 
such as SN, EDS, and WITAP in our sample were 
similar to those reported in other population-based 
samples, therefore, we believe selection bias has 
been reduced to the minimum possible. This leads 
us to believe that our survey return rate of 30.6 was 
a good representation of the general population of 
Tucson public school children. 

In conclusion, the TuCASA study has shown that 
children between 4 years and 11 years of age with 
LPs are more likely to have SN and EDS, and are 
more likely to be older. Children with EDS were 
more likely to have SN and WITAP, and to be 
female. Additionally, Hispanic children who were 4 
to 11 years of age were more likely to have a parental 
report of EDS, WITAP, and SN. Hispanic boys were 
more likely to have reports of EDS and LPs than 
were white boys or girls of the same age group. 
Furthermore, girls who were 4 to 11 years of age 
were more likely to have parental reports of daytime 
sleepiness than were boys. These differences in sleep 
symptoms that are associated with OSA do not 
appear to be attributable to language or interpretation 
anomalies.
