ABSTRACT: 
Objective: 
The 
goal 
of 
the 
study 
was 
to 
determine 
the 
relative 
importance 
of 
sleep, 
IQ, 
neuropsychological, 
and 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder 
(ADHD) 
scores 
in 
predicting 
academic 
achievement. 
Method: 
Objective 
overnight 
polysomnograph 
sleep 
scores, 
parent 
ratings 
of 
sleep 
problems, 
IQ, 
neuropsychological 
test 
scores, 
and 
parent 
ratings 
of 
ADHD 
were 
used 
to 
predict 
academic 
achievement 
in 
a 
general 
population 
sample 
of 
412 
elementary 
schoolchildren, 
6 
to 
12 
years 
of 
age 
with 
IQs 
of 
71 
to 
147. 
Results: 
Using 
stepwise 
linear 
regression 
analysis, 
IQ 
was 
the 
best 
single 
predictor 
of 
reading 
and 
math 
achievement 
test 
scores. 
The 
most 
powerful 
combined 
predictors 
of 
achievement 
were 
IQ 
and 
some 
of 
the 
neuropsychological 
test 
scores. 
Subjective 
parent-reported 
sleep 
problems 
and 
objective 
polysomnograph 
scores 
(apnea-hypopnea 
index, 
mean 
oxygen 
saturation 
and 
lowest 
saturation 
percentage 
during 
sleep, 
snoring 
frequency 
and 
severity, 
sleep 
latency, 
minutes 
to 
rapid 
eye 
movement 
(REM) 
sleep, 
arousal 
index, 
number 
of 
awakenings, 
sleep 
efficiency, 
and 
percentage 
of 
stage 
1, 
2, 
3, 
4, 
and 
REM 
sleep) 
did 
not 
contribute 
significantly 
more 
to 
the 
prediction 
of 
achievement. 
Children 
with 
and 
without 
sleep 
problems 
did 
not 
differ 
from 
each 
other 
in 
achievement. 
IQ, 
neuropsychological 
test 
scores, 
and 
ADHD 
ratings 
were 
all 
significantly 
related 
to 
achievement, 
but 
correlations 
between 
achievement 
and 
objective 
and 
subjective 
sleep 
scores 
were 
all 
nonsignificant. 
Conclusions: 
There 
may 
be 
individual 
children 
for 
whom 
sleep 
problems 
affect 
achievement, 
but 
for 
a 
large 
group 
of 
community 
children, 
sleep 
was 
not 
significantly 
related 
to 
academic 
functioning. 
In 
contrast, 
IQ 
and 
neuropsychological 
test 
scores 
were 
powerful 
predictors 
of 
achievement.

Sleep 
disturbances 
(difficulty 
falling 
or 
staying 
asleep) 
and 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
together 
affect 
up 
to 
50% 
of 
children 
in 
the 
general 
population1–3 
and 
are 
common 
in 
children 
with 
neuropsychiatric 
disorders.4 
Significant 
associations 
between 
sleep 
disturbance 
and 
impaired 
neuropsychological, 
behavioral, 
emotional, 
and 
academic 
functioning 
have 
been 
reported 
in 
some 
studies, 
though 
findings 
are 
inconsistent 
and 
often 
contradictory. 
These 
findings 
have 
been 
interpreted 
as 
indicating 
that 
sleep 
problems 
cause 
daytime 
deficits, 
including 
low 
academic 
achievement.5– 
8 
For 
example, 
the 
DSM-IV-TR 
states 
that 
children 
with 
sleep 
disordered 
breathing 
may 
have 
“learning 
difficulties, 
poor 
attention, 
and 
hyperactive 
behavior.”4 
The 
National 
Institutes 
of 
Health 
state 
that 
the 
extent 
of 
sleep 
disturbances 
in 
children 
is 
far 
greater 
than 
previously 
believed 
and 
“the 
consequent 
impact 
on 
mood, 
neurobehavioral 
and 
academic 
functioning, 
safety, 
and 
health 
is 
considerable.”9

It 
is 
certainly 
reasonable 
to 
hypothesize 
that 
sleep 
problems 
have 
a 
negative 
impact 
on 
daytime 
functioning 
for 
some 
children. 
However, 
it 
is 
premature 
to 
state 
that 
sleep 
problems 
are 
a 
primary 
cause 
of 
academic 
(or 
attention, 
neuropsychological, 
behavioral, 
or 
emotional) 
problems 
because 
existing 
studies 
are 
purely 
correlational 
(not 
causal) 
and 
do 
not 
consistently 
support 
this 
position. 
Alternative 
hypotheses 
must 
be 
considered. 
The 
association 
may 
not 
be 
unidirectional 
(i.e., 
mood 
and 
behavior 
problems 
may 
cause 
sleep 
problems) 
or 
causal 
(i.e., 
sleep 
and 
daytime 
deficits 
may 
be 
comorbid 
and 
have 
a 
common 
neurophysiologic 
etiology). 
Further, 
they 
may 
both 
be 
related 
to 
something 
else 
accounting 
for 
the 
association, 
such 
as 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder 
(ADHD). 
The 
majority 
of 
children 
with 
ADHD 
have 
learning, 
behavior, 
and 
neuropsychological 
deficits,10 
–13 
and 
parent-reported 
sleep 
problems 
are 
common 
in 
ADHD.14 
–17 
These 
hypotheses 
are 
not 
mutually 
exclusive 
and 
may 
all 
be 
accurate 
to 
some 
degree. 
Studies 
specifically 
designed 
to 
test 
these 
hypotheses 
have 
not 
yet 
been 
conducted.

Studies 
show

between

when 
achievement

Two 
studies 
using 
grades 
from 
school 
records 
showed 
a 
significant 
association 
with 
parent 
report 
of 
snoring,8,26 
but 
another 
did 
not.27 
Using 
adolescent 
self-
report, 
shorter 
sleep 
duration 
was 
associated 
with 
lower 
grades 
in 
one 
study,28 
but 
not 
in 
another.29 


Two 
studies 
used 
a 
control 
group 
and 
analyzed 
academic 
functioning 
before 
and 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
in 
children 
treated 
for 
sleep-disordered 
breathing. 
Gozal30 
reported 
an 
increase 
in 
grade 
point 
average 
from 
2.4 
to 


2.9 
following 
surgery 
in 
the 
treated 
group 
and 
from 
2.4 
to 
2.5 
in 
the 
control 
group. 
However, 
Montgomery-Downs 
et 
al31 
did 
not 
find 
a 
change 
in 
reading 
readiness 
scores 
before 
and 
after 
surgery 
in 
preschool 
children. 
Because 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
conduct 
blind, 
placebo-controlled 
surgical 
studies, 
it 
is 
not 
known 
whether 
reported 
improvement 
in 
pre-post 
studies 
is 
the 
result 
of 
placebo 
response, 
halo 
effect, 
or 
regression 
to 
the 
mean 
and 
not 
treatment 
effects. 
STUDY 
PURPOSE 


The 
purpose 
of 
our 
study 
was 
to 
determine 
the 
relative 
importance 
of 
sleep, 
IQ, 
neuropsychological 
test 
scores, 
and 
ADHD 
symptoms 
in 
predicting 
academic 
achievement 
in 
a 
large 
community 
sample 
of 
children. 
It 
is 
known 
that 
IQ 
is 
strongly 
related 
to 
achievement32–38 
and 
that 
some 
neuropsychological 
test 
scores 
are 
significantly 
correlated 
with 
achievement.39 
It 
is 
also 
well 
established 
that 
ADHD 
and 
learning 
problems 
have 
high 
comorbidity.11,12 
Studies 
using 
subjective 
sleep 
and 
achievement 
measures 
suggest 
a 
significant 
relationship 
between 
sleep 
problems 
and 
low 
achievement, 
but 
the 
relationship 
is 
generally 
nonsignificant 
when 
objective 
measures 
are 
used. 
No 
study 
has 
yet 
examined 
the 
relative 
importance 
of 
all 
these 
variables 
in 
predicting 
academic 
achievement. 
Our 
study 
includes 
both 
subjective 
and 
objective 
measures 
of 
sleep 
and 
achievement, 
including 
(1) 
overnight 
polysomnography 
yielding 
14 
objective 
sleep 
variables, 
(2) 
parent-reported 
sleep 
problems, 
(3) 
standardized 
academic 
achievement 
test 
scores, 
(4) 
parent 
ratings 
of 
school 
problems, 
and 
(5) 
learning 
disability 
diagnosis. 
As 
noted 
by 
Curcio 
et 
al,40 
published 
studies 
investigating 
sleep 
and 
academic 
functioning 
have 
relied 
heavily 
on 
subjective 
report 
of 
school 
problems 
without 
using 
a 
multimeasure 
approach 
that 
includes 
individually 
administered 
achievement 
tests. 
We 
hypothesize 
that 
IQ, 
neuropsychological 
test 
scores, 
and 
ADHD 
ratings 
will 
be 
significantly 
related 
to 
achievement 
(based 
on 
previous 
research), 
but 
that 
objective 
and 
subjective 
sleep 
scores 
may 
not 
be 
associated 
with 
achievement, 
given 
equivocal 
findings 
published 
to 
date. 


METHODS 


Sample 


The 
sample 
comprised 
412 
kindergarten 
through 
fifth 
grade 
students 
in 
three 
school 
districts 
who 
were 
subjects 
in 
a 
general 
population 
epidemiologic 
study 
of 
the 
prevalence 
of 
sleep 
disorders 
in 
children. 
Questionnaires 
were 
sent 
home 
to 
the 
parents 
of 
every 
elementary 
student 
in 
these 
districts 
(n 
. 
7312), 
with 
a 
78.5% 
response 
rate. 
From 
this 
sample, 
students 
were 
invited 
(using 
stratified 
random 
sampling 
so 
that 
the 
sample 
matched 
the 


original 
survey 
sample 
on 
age, 
gender, 
race, 
and 
risk 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing) 
for 
further 
evaluation 
in 
the 
sleep 
laboratory. 
Seventy 
percent 
of 
the 
invited 
families 
agreed 
to 
participate. 
The 
412 
children 
in 
our 
study 
are 
all 
of 
the 
children 
from 
the 
larger 
study 
who 
completed 
the 
sleep, 
neuropsychological, 
and 
achievement 
measures 
of 
interest 
in 
our 
study. 
No 
data 
were 
missing 
for 
any 
children 
in 
our 
study. 
Sixteen 
children 
with 
major 
medical 
and 
neurological 
conditions 
(epilepsy, 
autism, 
juvenile 
rheumatoid 
arthritis, 
diabetes, 
and 
hemophilia) 
were 
excluded 
from 
the 
study 
so 
that 
sleep 
and 
achievement 
scores 
were 
not 
confounded 
by 
these 
neuromedical 
problems. 
Children 
diagnosed 
with 
mental 
health 
or 
learning 
disorders 
(e.g., 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder 
[ADHD], 
learning 
disability, 
and 
anxiety 
disorder) 
were 
not 
excluded 
from 
the 
study. 
No 
medication 
changes 
were 
made 
for 
any 
children 
in 
the 
study. 
The 
mean 
age 
of 
the 
sample 
is 
8.6 
years 
(range, 
6–12, 
SD 
. 
1.7), 
and 
the 
mean 
IQ 
is 
106.6 
(range, 
71–147, 
SD 
. 
13.5). 
Fifty-two 
percent 
of 
the 
children 
are 
male, 
74% 
are 
white, 
20% 
are 
black, 
5% 
are 
Asian, 
1% 
is 
Hispanic, 
and 
53% 
have 
a 
parent 
with 
a 
professional 
or 
managerial 
occupation. 
Our 
study 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
Institutional 
Review 
Board 
at 
Penn 
State 
College 
of 
Medicine. 
Informed 
consent 
was 
obtained 
from 
parents 
of 
all 
participants 
and 
assent 
was 
obtained 
from 
all 
children 
prior 
to 
participation. 


Polysomnography 


All 
children 
underwent 
a 
full-night 
polysomnography 
with 
a 
parent 
present 
in 
a 
sound-attenuated 
and 
light-and 
temperature-controlled 
room 
in 
our 
research 
center. 
Each 
child 
was 
monitored 
with 
an 
infrared 
video 
and 
a 
computerized 
system 
using 
Gamma 
software 
that 
includes 
an 
electroencephalogram, 
two-channel 
bilateral 
electroculogram, 
and 
chin 
and 
anterior 
tibial 
electromyogram. 
Respiration 
was 
measured 
throughout 
the 
night 
with 
a 
thermocouple 
at 
nose 
and 
mouth, 
nasal 
pressure 
monitor, 
and 
thoracic 
and 
abdominal 
respiratory 
effort 
gauges. 
Snoring 
sounds 
were 
measured 
by 
a 
throat 
sensor. 
All 
night 
hemoglobin 
oxygen 
saturation 
was 
obtained 
by 
pulse 
oximeter 
attached 
to 
the 
finger. 
A 
single-channel 
electrocardiogram 
was 
recorded. 
An 
apnea 
event 
was 
defined 
as 
a 
cessation 
of 
airflow 
for 
a 
minimum 
of 
5 
seconds 
and 
an 
out-of-phase 
strain 
gauge 
movement. 
Hypopnea 
was 
defined 
as 
a 
reduction 
in 
airflow 
with 
an 
associated 
decrease 
in 
oxygen 
saturation 
of 
at 
least 
3% 
or 
an 
associated 
arousal. 


Fourteen 
objective 
polysomnograph 
sleep 
scores 
were 
used 
in 
the 
data 
analyses: 
apnea-hypopnea 
index 
(number 
of 
apnea 
or 
hypopnea 
events 
per 
hour 
of 
sleep), 
sleep 
latency 
in 
minutes, 
minutes 
from 
sleep 
onset 
to 
rapid 
eye 
movement 
(REM) 
sleep, 
sleep 
efficiency 
(time 
asleep 
divided 
by 
total 
time 
in 
bed), 
awakenings 
(number 
of 
wake 
periods 
30 
seconds 
after 
sleep 
onset), 
mean 
oxygen 
saturation 
percentage 
during 
sleep, 
lowest 
oxygen 
saturation 
percentage 
during 
sleep, 
arousal 
index 
(mean 
number 
of 
arousals 
3 
seconds 
per 
hour), 
frequency 
of 
snoring 
(none, 
intermittent, 
and 
continuous), 
snoring 
severity 
(none, 
mild, 
moderate, 
and 
severe), 
and 
percentages 
of 
stage 
1,

Parent-Reported

Problems 
Ratings 


Parents 
rated 
their 
children 
on 
a 
4-point 
scale 
from 
“not 
at 
all 
a 
problem” 
to 
“very 
often 
a 
problem” 
on 
the 
165 
items 
on 
the 
Pediatric 
Behavior 
Scale 
(PBS),41 
which 
yields 
norm 
referenced 
T 
scores 
for 
several 
clinical 
sub-
scales. 
The 
PBS 
measures 
sleep 
disturbance 
(difficulty 
falling 
and 
staying 
asleep), 
sleep 
duration 
relative 
to 
the 
norm, 
parasomnias 
(nightmares, 
sleep 
walking, 
and 
talking 
in 
sleep), 
and 
daytime 
sleepiness, 
and 
it 
yields 
a 
total 
sleep 
problems 
T 
score 
based 
on 
norms 
for 
the 
child’s 
age 
and 
gender. 
Parents 
also 
completed 
the 
Children’s 
Sleep-
Wake 
Scale42 
and 
the 
Pediatric 
Sleep 
Questionnaire.43 
The 
PBS 
was 
chosen 
as 
the 
primary 
parent 
report 
measure 
because 
it 
yields 
a 
norm-referenced 
standard 
score, 
unlike 
the 
other 
two 
measures. 
In 
our 
sample, 
the 
PBS 
total 
sleep 
problems 
score 
correlated 
significantly 
with 
the 
total 
sleep 
disturbance 
score 
on 
the 
Children’s 
Sleep-
Wake 
Scale 
(r 
.76, 
p 
.0001) 
and 
the 
Pediatric 
Sleep 
Questionnaire 
(r 
.72, 
p 
.0001). 


The 
PBS 
ADHD 
subscale 
consists 
of 
15 
ADHD 
symptoms, 
and 
the 
School 
Problems 
subscale 
comprises 
seven 
items 
(e.g., 
“has 
trouble 
learning 
even 
when 
tries 
hard” 
and 
“gets 
low 
grades 
on 
school 
papers 
or 
tests”). 
The 
PBS 
significantly 
differentiates 
between 
diagnostic 
groups 
and 
has 
been 
used 
to 
evaluate 
ADHD 
and 
behavior, 
mood, 
sleep, 
school,

Stepwise 
linear

analysis 
(with

R2) 
was 
used 
to 
determine 
explained

and 
the 
most 
powerful 
predictors 
of 
reading 
and 
math 
standard 
scores 
using

neuropsychological, 
ADHD, 
and 
sleep 
scores. 
Pearson

The 
significance 
of 
differences 
in 
variable 
frequencies 
between 
groups 
was 
calculated 
using

Independent 
t

and 
Cohen’s

determined 
differences 
between 
groups. 
In 
analyses 
based 
on 
parent 
report, 
ADHD 
ratings 
were 
covaried 
using 
analysis 
of 
covariance 
because 
ADHD 
is 
associated 
with 
both 
learning 
problems11 
and 
parent-
reported

A 
probability 
level 
of

was 
chosen 
for

DISCUSSION 


Our 
study 
is 
the 
first 
to 
comprehensively 
analyze 
the 
relationship 
between 
academic 
achievement 
and 
sleep 
using 
extensive 
objective 
and 
subjective 
measures 
of 
sleep 
and 
achievement 
and 
the 
first 
to 
determine 
the 
relative 
importance 
of 
sleep, 
IQ, 
neuropsychological 
scores, 
and 
attentiondeficit/
hyperactivity 
disorder 
(ADHD) 
symptoms 
in 
predicting 
achievement. 
When 
IQ, 
six 
neuropsychological 
test 
scores, 
parent 
ADHD 
ratings, 
and 
14 
objective 
and 
three 
subjective 
measures 
of 
sleep 
were 
entered 
as 
predictor 
variables, 
IQ 
was 
the 
best 
single 
predictor 
of 
reading 
and 
math 
achievement 
test 
scores, 
explaining 
31% 
and 
27%, 
respectively, 
of 
the 
variance. 
The 
primary 
importance 
of 
IQ 
in 
determining 
achievement 
is 
consistent 
with 
findings 
from 
other 
studies.32–38 
The 
most 
powerful 
combined 
predictors 
of 
achievement 
in 
our 
study 
were 
IQ 
and 
some 
of 
the 
neuropsychological 
test 
scores, 
explaining 
42% 
of 
the 
reading 
variance 
and 
40% 
of 
the 
math 
variance. 
The 
14 
objective 
polysomnograph 
and 
three 
parent-reported 
sleep 
problems 
scores 
did 
not 
contribute 
significantly 
more 
to 
the 
prediction 
of 
achievement.

neuropsychological 
test 
scores, 
and 
ADHD 
parent 
ratings 
were 
all 
significant, 
whereas 
correlations 
between 
achievement 
and 
objective 
and 
subjective 
sleep 
scores 
were 
all 
nonsignificant. 
This 
is 
consistent 
with 
previous 
studies 
demonstrating 
that 
achievement 
measured 
by 
standardized 
achievement 
tests 
is 
not 
significantly 
related 
to 
sleep 
problems.24,25 
Further, 
studies 
have 
also 
shown 
that 
severity 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
does 
not 
correspond 
with 
severity 
of 
ADHD 
symptoms,16,52 
neuropsychological 
test 
scores,25,53–55 
and 
parent 
ratings 
of 
mood 
and

Urschitz 
et

found 
a 
nonsignificant 
association 
between 
academic 
grades 
and 
hypoxia 
events, 
but 
a 
significant 
relationship 
between 
math 
grades 
and 
the 
child’s 
lowest 
nighttime 
oxygen 
saturation 
percentage.57 
In 
our 
study, 
none 
of 
the 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
indices, 


including 
lowest 
oxygen 
saturation 
percentage, 
were 
significantly 
related 
to 
any 
of 
the 
achievement 
measures. 
However, 
a 
limitation 
of 
our 
study 
is 
the 
small 
number 
of 
children 
with 
severe 
sleep-disordered 
breathing. 
Future 
research 
will 
need 
to 
assess 
the 
relationship 
between 
achievement 
and 
sleep 
using 
a 
sample 
that 
has 
sufficiently 
large 
numbers 
of 
children 
representing 
all 
levels 
of 
sleep-
disordered 
breathing 
and 
other 
sleep 
problems. 
Another 
limitation 
of 
our 
study 
is 
that 
the 
Wide 
Range 
Achievement 
Test 
Reading 
and 
Arithmetic 
subtests 
assess 
only 
word 
reading 
and 
math 
computation 
skills. 
Future 
studies 
should 
include 
measures 
of 
reading 
comprehension 
and 
writing, 
as 
well 
as 
teacher 
ratings 
of 
achievement. 


Earlier 
studies 
suggest 
that 
when 
achievement 
and 
sleep 
are 
both 
subjectively 
measured, 
the 
relationship 
between 
the 
two 
is 
significant.18 
–23,58,59 
In 
our 
study, 
children 
with 
versus 
without 
parent-reported 
academic 
problems 
did 
not 
differ 
on 
objective 
sleep 
dimensions, 
but 
did 
on 
parent-reported 
sleep 
problems, 
perhaps 
in 
part 
because 
of 
common 
source 
variance 
(i.e., 
both 
sleep 
and 
academic 
problems 
were 
ratings 
by 
the 
same 
parent 
using 
the 
same 
rating 
scale). 
However, 
this 
difference 
was 
nonsignificant 
when 
the 
effects 
of 
parent-reported 
ADHD 
symptoms 
were 
removed. 


The 
relationship 
between 
ADHD 
and 
sleep 
is 
in 
need 
of 
much 
further 
study. 
Studies 
report 
contradictory 
findings 
on 
differences 
in 
apnea-hypopnea 
indexes 
between 
children 
with 
ADHD 
and 
controls.60–62 
Parent-reported 
sleep 
problems 
are 
common 
in 
ADHD.14 
–17 
In 
contrast, 
objective 
polysomnograph 
sleep 
data 
generally 
do 
not 
show 
differences 
between 
children 
with 
ADHD 
and 
controls 
in 
terms 
of 
sleep 
latency 
and 
efficiency, 
nighttime 
awakenings, 
and 
sleep 
stages,60–65 
and 
the 
relationship 
between 
severity 
of 
ADHD 
symptoms 
and 
severity 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
is 
nonsignificant.16,52 
Our 
study 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
preponderance 
of 
previous 
research 
and 
showed 
a 
significant 
association 
between 
parent-reported 
ADHD 
symptoms 
and 
parent-reported 
sleep 
problems, 
but 
not 
between 
ADHD 
symptoms 
and 
14 
objective 
polysomnograph 
sleep 
measures.

tween 
parent 
ratings 
of 
ADHD 
and 
sleep 
problems 
may 
be 
inflated 
somewhat 
by 
common 
source 
variance, 
which 
would 
not 
be 
a 
factor 
when 
objective 
sleep 
measures 
are 
used. 
Further, 
the 
relationship 
between 
parent 
report 
of 
ADHD 
symptoms 
and 
sleep 
problems 
may 
partially 
be 
because 
both 
are 
to 
some 
degree 
behavioral. 


Findings 
in 
previous 
studies 
regarding 
the 
relationship 
between 
sleep 
and 
academic 
achievement 
and 
between 
sleep 
and 
ADHD 
symptoms 
differ 
depending 
on 
whether 
sleep 
is 
subjectively 
or 
objectively 
defined. 
This 
suggests 
that 
the 
two 
methods 
of 
evaluation 
are 
measuring 
different 
sleep 
dimensions. 
Parent-reported 
sleep 
problems 
may 
primarily 
reflect 
observable, 
behavioral 
aspects 
of 
sleep, 
whereas 
objective 
sleep 
laboratory 
data 
may 
primarily 
reflect 
physiologic 
aspects 
of 
sleep. 


Some 
previous 
studies 
show 
an 
association 
between 
sleep 
and 
daytime 
deficits, 
though 
findings 
are 
inconsistent 
and 
contradictory. 
These 
studies 
demonstrate 
a 
possible 
correlation, 
but 
not 
causation. 
The 
relationship 
between 
subjective 
report 
of 
sleep 
problems 
and 
subjective 
report 
of 
achievement18 
–23,58,59 
may 
be 
because 
both 
sleep 
and 
academic 
problems 
are 
related 
to 
behavior, 
mood, 
parenting, 
or 
other 
problems 
common 
to 
both 
and 
not 
because 
of 
a 
direct 
causal 
relationship 
between 
sleep 
and 
achievement. 
Sleep 
and 
daytime 
deficits, 
including 
low 
achievement, 
may 
have 
a 
common 
neurophysiologic 
etiology 
or 
they 
may 
both 
be 
related 
to 
something 
else, 
accounting 
for 
the 
association. 
For 
example, 
children 
with 
(vs 
without) 
sleep 
problems 
have 
parents 
with 
lower 
educational 
levels 
and 
professional 
status,21 
which 
may 
account 
for 
the 
lower 
school 
achievement. 
Similarly, 
lax 
parenting 
discipline 
style 
has 
been 
associated 
with 
sleep 
disturbance,66 
and 
this 
style 
may 
also 
be 
associated 
with 
low 
child 
achievement. 


In 
conclusion, 
our 
study 
showed 
that 
parent 
report 
of 
sleep 
problems 
and 
objective 
polysomnograph 
sleep 
scores 
did 
not 
contribute 
significantly 
to 
the 
prediction 
of 
reading 
and 
math 
achievement 
in 
a 
general 
population 
of 
412 
elementary 
schoolchildren. 
IQ 
was 
the 
best 
single 
predictor 
of 
achievement, 
and 
IQ 
and 
some 
neuropsychological 
test 
scores 
were 
the 
most 
powerful 
combined 
predictors 
of 
achievement. 
Further, 
IQ, 
neuropsychological 
test 
scores, 
and 
ADHD 
parent 
ratings 
were 
all 
significantly 
related 
to 
achievement, 
but 
correlations 
between 
achievement 
and 
objective 
and 
subjective 
sleep 
scores 
were 
all 
nonsignificant. 
There 
certainly 
may 
be 
individual 
children 
for 
whom 
sleep 
problems 
affect 
academic 
achievement, 
but 
for 
a 
large 
group 
of 
community 
children, 
sleep 
was 
not 
significantly 
related 
to 
academic 
functioning, 
whereas 
IQ 
and 
neuropsychological 
test 
scores 
were 
powerful 
predictors 
of 
achievement.
