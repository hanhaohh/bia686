ABSTRACT 


OBJECTIVE. 
The objective of this study was to describe overnight polysomnographic 
measures in normal children aged 3 to 7 years. We conducted a retrospective 
analysis of normal polysomnographic evaluations from participants in 2 large 
community-based studies of sleep-disordered breathing among preschoolers and 
early school-aged children at Kosair Children’s Hospital Sleep Medicine Research 
Center at the University of Louisville. Participants included 542 healthy children 
with ages ranging from 3.2 to 8.6 years. 

RESULTS. 
Subjects were excluded from analysis if they had documented snoring 
during polysomnography, an obstructive apnea-hypopnea index of 1.0, or a 
periodic leg-movement index of 5.0. Because the greatest differences in polysomnography 
occurred between ages 5 and 6 years, analyses were performed for 
children 3 to 5 years and for ages 6. Sleep cyclicity was distinct between age 
groups, with both showing an initial brief rapid-eye-movement period, which 
lengthened across the night, but only the older group showing a decrease in cycle 
length across the night. Average obstructive apnea indices were 0.03 per hour of 
total sleep time (TST) for 3-to 5-year-old children and 0.05 per hour of TST for 

6-year-old children, whereas central apnea indices were 0.82 and 0.45 per hour 
of TST, respectively. Older children spent a greater percentage of sleep time supine, 
and the apnea-hypopnea index differed according to body position. Twenty percent 
of all subjects had end tidal carbon dioxide values of 45 mm Hg, and 2.2% 
had recorded values 50 mm Hg during 50% TST. High variance was present on 
all measures. 
CONCLUSIONS. 
Developmental changes occur in several polysomnographic measures 
among normal children from 3 to 7 years of age, particularly during transition 
from preschool to early school age. Our findings in a large number of healthy 
community children comprise the most extensive compilation of normative reference 
values for laboratory-based pediatric polysomnography to date.

EDIATRIC SLEEP CONTINUES to gain significant recognition 
as a result of both increasing evidence for a 
high prevalence of sleep disorders among children and 
by virtue of the potential somatic and biobehavioral 
effects of altered sleep during development. Sleep-disordered 
breathing (SDB) is by far the most frequently 
diagnosed pediatric sleep disorder, affects at least 1% to 
3% of all children, and has been found to impose substantial 
adverse effects on cognition and school performance.
1–9 Indeed, symptoms consistent with risk for SDB 
have been reported in 6% to 27% of children.2,10,11 Children 
with SDB use greater health care resources12 and 
experience more frequent cardiovascular morbidity13,14 
and comorbid chronic illnesses.10,15 Children with SDB 
also display greater psychiatric and behavioral comorbidities.
5,6,16–18 The cumulative evidence pointing to potential 
partial irreversibility of the cardiovascular, economic, 
and cognitive effects in both humans19–22 and 
animal models23,24 (see review in ref 25) highlights the 
importance of early detection of pediatric sleep disorders. 
However, interpretation of abnormal polysomnography 
and accurate diagnosis of disorders remains one of 
the challenges to pediatric sleep medicine and research, 
largely as a result of a historic lack of normative reference 
values. Because polysomnography is expensive 
and labor-intensive, and demands on resources are 
generally taken up by evaluation of disordered subjects 
or patients, few studies report normative values. These 
studies have universally reported either a small number 
of subjects or a wide age range, and most have focused 
on polysomnography in the laboratory,26–30 but several 
have reported results from polysomnography in the 
home31–34 or arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2)35 recorded 
in the home. In accordance with the 1996 mandate by 
the American Thoracic Society,36 the purpose of the 
present study was to develop normative polysomnographic 
reference values from a large group of healthy 
children spanning over a concise age range from a diverse, 
nonclinical community population. 

METHODS 


The study was approved by the institutional review 
boards at University of Louisville and Kosair Children’s 
Hospital; informed consent was obtained before the 
overnight polysomnography. For subjects 7 years, subject 
assent was in the presence of a parent. 

Participants 


Data were obtained retrospectively from participants in 2 
ongoing large-scale studies of community children attending 
either preschool or first-grade classes in the 
Jefferson County Public School System (Louisville, KY). 
Screening questionnaires were sent home with all children 
enrolled in Jump Start preschool classes to be completed 
by the parent and returned to the school where 

they then were collected by a researcher. Screening 
questionnaires were also sent to the homes of all children 
who were enrolled in first-grade classes in the 
Louisville metropolitan public school system to be returned 
by postage-paid mail to the research office. 

The purpose of these large-scale studies was to evaluate 
children for evidence of SDB. Thus, qualifying 
at-risk subjects were recruited for overnight polysomnographic 
assessment using a parentally reported questionnaire 
that had been previously validated with the same 
populations.8 Control children who did not have a history 
of risk for SDB were also recruited into both studies 
and were included in the present analyses. 

Screening 
Questionnaire 


The questionnaire and extensive validation on the same 
groups whose data are reported here have been described 
previously.8 Briefly, information collected included 
demographics for parents and child and child 
health, sleep, and daytime behaviors. Participants in the 
larger studies included those within the entire range of 
parental report for risk for SDB who were contacted by 
phone from November 2001 through September 2002 
for preschoolers and January 2000 to October 2004 for 
first-graders and invited to participate in the second 
phase of the study, which included overnight polysomnographic 
and cognitive and behavioral assessments. Results 
of the SDB evaluations and relationships with cognitive 
competence have been reported elsewhere.7,9,22,37,38 

Exclusionary 
Criteria 


Subjects were excluded from polysomnography if they 
had incomplete questionnaires and/or contact information, 
chronic medical conditions, genetic or overt craniofacial 
abnormalities, and/or they had previously sought 
medical evaluation for snoring. No polysomnography 
was performed on a night when a child had a fever, signs 
of respiratory or other infection or was reported to be 
feeling ill. 

For the present study, participants in the original 
studies were excluded if they had an obstructive apneahypopnea 
index (AHI) of 1 or a periodic leg-movement 
(PLM) index of 5. Analyses for cyclicity, body 
position, and state dependency were available only for 
subjects recorded after February 2002, and end-tidal 
carbon dioxide (ETCO2) values from 43 subjects were 
unavailable as a result of equipment malfunction, persistent 
oral breathing, or cannula occlusion. 

Overnight 
Polysomnography 


Standard overnight multichannel polysomnographic 
evaluation was performed in the Sleep Medicine Center 
at Kosair Children’s Hospital. Children were studied for 
up to 12 hours in a quiet, darkened room with an 
ambient temperature of 24°C with a parent or guardian 
present. Average time for lights out was 21:31 (SD:

23 minutes) and average time for lights on was 06:20 
(SD: 26 minutes). No medications were used to induce 
sleep. 
All measures were digitized by using commercially 
available polysomnographic systems; the first 11 preschool 
and 187 first-grade subjects were recorded by 
using Stellate Systems (Mission Viejo, CA). Subsequent 
recordings were performed by using MedCare Systems 
(MedCare Diagnostics, Buffalo, NY). The same parameters 
were used with both systems to record physiological 
measures: chest and abdominal wall movement by respiratory 
impedance or inductance plethysmography; 
heart rate by electrocardiogram; air flow with a side-
stream end-tidal capnograph (PETCO2; BCI SC-300, Red-
ding Medical, Inc, Finksburg, MD), which also provided 
breath-by-breath assessment of ETCO2 levels, and an oral-

nasal airflow thermistor. SpO2 was assessed by pulse 
oximetry (Nellcor N 100; Nellcor, Inc, Hayward, CA) 
with simultaneously recorded pulse-wave form. Bilateral 
electrooculograms, 8 channels of electroencephalograms, 
chin and anterior tibial electromyograms, and 
analog output from a body-position sensor (Braebon 
Medical Corp, Ogdensburg, NY) were monitored also. 
Tracheal sound was monitored with a microphone sensor 
(Sleepmate; Rochester Electro-Medical, Inc, Tampa, 
FL), and digital time-synchronized video images were 
collected.

lysts, and interscorer reliability assessments were performed. 


Sleep-state percentages were calculated on the basis 
of both the total sleep time (TST) and time in bed (TIB) 
(from lights out to lights on); analyses for age, gender, 
and ethnicity differences were performed by using measures 
based on TST. Sleep efficiency was calculated as 
the percent of time sleeping as a function of the TIB. 
Sleep latency was the time from lights out to the first 3 
consecutive epochs of stage 1 sleep. Rapid-eye-movement 
(REM) sleep latency was the time from lights out 
to the first epoch of REM sleep. 

Sleep cyclicity was calculated; the first cycle was defined 
as the period from sleep onset through the ending 
of the first REM cycle, and subsequent cycles were based 
on the period from the ending of one REM bout through 
the ending of the subsequent REM bout. A REM bout 
was defined as a period of 1 REM epochs separated by 

40 epochs of stage 1, 2, 3, or 4 or wake. 
Respiratory 
Events, 
Oxygen 
Saturation, 
and 
Peak 
ETCO2 


Central, obstructive, and mixed apneic events were 
scored by changes occurring in oral-nasal thermistor 
and/or ETCO2 cannula. Obstructive apnea was defined as 
the absence of airflow with continued chest-wall and 
abdominal movement for at least 2 breaths.28,36 Hypopneas 
were defined as a decrease in nasal flow of 50% 
with a corresponding decrease in SpO2 4% and/or with 
associated arousal.36 The AHI was defined as the number 
of apneas and hypopneas per hour of TST or by sleep-
state and/or body-position subanalyses as appropriate. 
Apnea index (AI) was defined as the number of apneas 

per hour of TST.* Central apnea was defined as the 
absence of both airflow and respiratory effort for at least 
2 breaths. 

Oxygen saturation values were computed to determine 
the following measures: mean SpO2 during sleep 
time; SpO2 nadir; and SpO2 desaturation indices during 
TST, REM, and non-REM (NREM). The percent of de-
saturations (4% below baseline) to 95%, 90%, and 
85% were calculated, as was the percent of sleep time 
spent in the ranges from 96% to 100%, 91% to 95%, 
86% to 90%, and 81% to 85%. 

Mean TST peak ETCO2 (PETCO2) was determined, along 
with the percent of TST spent 45 and 50 mm Hg. 

Scoring of respiratory events and desaturations was 
initially automated; all events and signals were then 
individually scorer-validated. 

Arousals 


Because criteria for arousal have not yet been developed 
for children, arousals were defined as recommended by 
the American Sleep Disorders Association Task Force 
report40 and included spontaneous, respiratory-related 
(occurring immediately subsequent to an apnea, hypopnea, 
or snore), and technician-induced arousals. All 
arousals were scored manually. Total and subtype 
arousal indices were expressed as the number of arousals 

* The 
respiratory 
disturbance 
index 
(RDI) 
has 
been 
operationally 
defined 
in 
several 
different 
ways. 
For 
example, 
1 
study 
defined 
RDI 
as 
an 
index 
different 
than 
the 
AHI 
(which 
was 
referred 
to 
as 
the 
“AHT”),48 
whereas 
another 
study 
defined 
RDI 
as 
being 
synonymous 
with 
the 
AHI.49 
To 
avoid 
confusion, 
the 
term 
RDI 
was 
not 
used 
here, 
and 
AHI 
refers 
to 
the 
number 
of 
apneas 
and 
hypopneas 
per 
hour 
of 
sleep.

RESULTS 


Of a total of 542 children, 23 were aged 3 years, 78 aged 
4 years, 72 aged 5 years, 238 aged 6 years, 124 aged 7 
years, and 7 aged 8 years. Children 3 to 5 years were 
grouped into the “younger” age group (173 children), 
and children 6 years were classified as the “older” age 
group (369 children). For cyclicity and state and body-
position subanalyses, only 107 younger and 162 older 
subjects were available. Ninety-five younger and 131 
older subjects were available for PETCO2 analyses.

. 
.996 
(P

.001). 

Original validation of the questionnaire instrument 
revealed that the parentally reported risk-factor profiles 
differed between preschoolers and first-graders, with different 
questionnaire items contributing to a parentally 
reported risk for SDB (PR-RSDB) score between the 2 

groups.8 In addition, likelihood ratios indicated that a 
PR-RSDB score of 17 for children 4 years was consistent 
with a diagnosis of SDB after polysomnography, 
whereas a PR-RSDB of 24 was required for children 

4 years. Accordingly, for the present study, comparisons 
between high and low PR-RSDB scores were made 
by using the appropriate profile and cutoff for the 2 age 
groups. No significant differences were found at either 
age for TST, sleep efficiency, sleep latency, REM latency, 
number of awakenings, amount of wake after sleep onset, 
percent awake, percent stage 1, percent stage 2, 
percent stage 3, percent stage 4, percent REM, TAI, PLM 
index, or AHI. Thus, although 20% of the younger and 
16% of the older children had a moderate parental-
reported history of risk for SDB, they are included in the 
normative analyses because they had clinically normal 
polysomnography and their polysomnographic measures 
did not differ from those of children with a low 
history of risk for SDB.

85), and spontaneous and total arousal indices did not 
differ between 3-to 5-year-old and 6-to 7-year-old 
children. RAIs differed (F . 
2.6; P 
. 
.05), but there was 
a nonsignificant geometric trend among the ages, and 
there were no sequential age differences. Data are subsequently 
presented for combined ages for these measures; 
all other measures differed among ages and are 
presented separately in subsequent tables (Table 1). 
There were significant gender-by-age-group differences 
on several measures. Younger females had higher 
sleep efficiency (F . 
5.1; P 
. 
.03; d 
. 
.29), less awake 
percent (F . 
5.9; P 
. 
.02; d 
. 
.38), and higher stage 3 
percent (F . 
5.8; P 
. 
.02; d 
. 
.31) than males in the 
same age group. Among older children, females had 
higher stage 1 percent than males (F . 
7.3; P 
. 
.007; d 
. 
.28). Ethnicity differences were tested among white and 

black children; white children had a higher stage 1 percent 
(F . 
8.5; P 
. 
.004; d 
. 
.22) and lower stage 2 
percent (F . 
4.9; P 
. 
.027; d 
. 
.22). Because the 
younger children were predominantly from a low-income 
group and the older children represented the general 
community, maternal education was used as a 
proxy for socioeconomic status to test potential differences 
between these groups. Latency to REM onset increased 
as maternal education increased (F . 
2.7; P 
. 
.04; d 
. 
.50), whereas the number of awakenings (F . 
7.7; P 
. 
.001; d 
. 
.86) and stage 4 percent (F . 
3.9; P 
. 
.009; d 
. 
.90) both decreased with advanced maternal 
education. Subject demographics, maternal education, 
and anthropometry data are presented in Table 2. 

Sleep time, latencies, and percent of time awake and 
in each sleep stage based on TIB and TST are shown in 
Table 3. TST and sleep efficiency initially increased until 
age 5 and then decreased in significant quadratic trends 
with significant changes from ages 3 to 4 on TST and 
from 3 to 4 and 6 to 7 for sleep efficiency. Sleep latency 
decreased linearly and REM latency increased linearly 
across ages, with significant changes from 3 to 4 for sleep

latency and from 4 to 5 and 5 to 6 for REM latency 
(Table 1). 

Wake percent showed a significant linear decrease 
across all ages, with significant differences from 3 to 4 
and 6 to 7 years. There were significant linear increases 
in stages 1 and 2 percent, whereas stages 3 and 4 percent 
decreased. For stages 1, 2, and 3 percent, there were 
significant changes between ages 5 and 6 (Table 3). 

Subjects varied in the number of REM/NREM sleep 
cycles that they had during polysomnography: from 4 to 
8 cycles for younger children (13% had 4 cycles, 31% 
had 5 cycles, 43% had 6 cycles, 8% had 7 cycles, and 5% 
had 8 cycles) and from 2 to 9 cycles for older children 

(3% had 2 cycles, 7% had 3 cycles, 28% had 4 cycles, 
36% had 5 cycles, 18% had 6 cycles, 6% had 7 cycles, 
1% had 8 cycles, and 1% had 9 cycles). The mode for 
number of REM/NREM cycles was used at each age (6 
for younger and 5 for older children) to calculate the 
display values in Table 4 and the idealized hypnograms 
in Fig 1. 

For both age groups, there was a significant linear 
trend for increased minutes of REM within cycles across 
the night (Flin . 
27.45 and P

.001 for younger children; 
Flin . 
17.9 and P

was no change in the duration of NREM/REM cycle

decrease in the NREM/REM cycle length across the night 
for older children (Flin . 
63.7; P 
. 
.001). 

There was a significant linear trend for decreased AHI 
across age but no significant change between progressive 
ages (Table 1). AHI and AI could be 1 as a result of the 
presence of central apneas. There was wide variance 
among subjects, but higher AHI in the younger group 
was accounted for by central apneas, which were prevalent 
at almost twice the rate in younger children (Table 
5). 

Although AHI showed developmental changes, the 
average SpO2 (97.7 [SD: 0.72]), nadir (93.6–99.9), and 
desaturation indices did not differ among ages. At all 
ages, desaturation indices in these healthy children were 
several-fold higher in REM than NREM sleep (Table 6), 
and the frequency of desaturations to 95%, 90%, 
and 85% SpO2 was higher during REM than NREM 
(Table 7). Overall, the average percent of time subjects 
spent at 95% SpO2 was 1% (Table 8). There were no 
age differences for PETCO2 values, with the average TST 
value being 40.7. Twenty percent of the subjects spent 
50% of TST at 45 mm Hg; 2.2% spent 50% of TST 
at 50 mm Hg (Table 9). 

A subgroup of children had screening questionnaires 
(N 
. 
239) asking if they had asthma using a yes/no 
response option; 14% of this group were reported to 
have asthma. There were no significant differences between 
yes and no responders in either age group on any 
arousal measure or sleep architecture. Fifty-one younger 
children were available for analysis of SpO2 and PETCO2 
measures. There were no significant differences between 
those children whose parents reported that they did or 
did not have asthma with regard to desaturation indices, 
average PETCO2, or percent TST when PETCO2 was 45 or 

50 mm Hg. Those children reported to have asthma 
spent a lower percent of TST in SpO2 values of 96% to 
100% and a higher percent of TST in SpO2 values of 91% 
to 95% (F . 
15.2; P 
. 
.001, each); children reported as 
having asthma spent 98.9% TST in SpO2 values of 96% 
to 100%, and those without asthma spent 99.9% TST in 
the same range. 
Arousals did not differ among the various ages. Spontaneous 
and respiratory-related arousals were highest in 
stages 1 and 2 and higher in REM than SWS. Overall, 
arousals occurred every 6 minutes throughout the night 
(Table 10). A linear increase in SPS was found across 
ages, but sequential age differences were not found. Five 
percent of the subjects had SPS 0.25, with all but 3 of 
these children in the older group. 

The PLM index was higher in younger children and 
decreased linearly across ages, with significant changes 
from 5 to 6 years. These differences seemed to be accounted 
for by differences in REM, which were higher in 
younger children (Table 11). 

From 5 to 6 years of age, there was a change toward 
greater time spent supine sleeping with reciprocal

changes in side sleeping, both of which changed linearly 
across ages (Table 12). The percentage of time sleeping in 
the prone position did not change across age (Table 1). 

AHI during side sleeping in REM was higher in 
younger than in older children (Table 13). 

DISCUSSION 


These data comprise the first large-scale study providing 
reference values for normal sleep in children ages 3 to 7 
years and the first to analyze developmental changes 
across this relatively narrow age range. Developmental 
analysis was particularly important because significant 
individual differences were found throughout the analyses; 
SDs were higher than means on most measures. 
Tables 14–16 summarize the present findings and those 
previously reported for comparable age ranges. 

TST in the present cohort was higher than that reported 
for several other sleep laboratory–based stud


ies26,28,30,34,42 

and less than the sleep duration recorded 
when the studies were conducted in the home.31,33 Sleep 
efficiency was comparable to that reported by other 
studies in a laboratory setting30,34,42,50 but lower than the 
sleep efficiency during home recordings.31,33 Sleep latency 
was twice as long among our subjects compared 
with that found in the Tucson Children’s Assessment of 
Sleep Apnea (TuCASA) study,33 but only marginally 
longer when compared with the other home-based 
study by Stores et al31 and the laboratory-based study by 
Coble et al.26 We were unable to find previous reference 
values for REM latency. There is variance among previous 
reports for sleep stage percents26,30,31,34,42,50; those in 
the present study were particularly distinct from those 
found in the TuCASA study,33 which found higher stage 
2 and lower SWS percentages, and the SWS values reported 
by Traeger et al.50 

Consistent with Coble et al,26 we found a lengthening 
of REM periods across the first 4 cycles of the night, and 
compared with that group’s values for 6-to 7-year-old 
children, the present study reports the exact same number 
of REM/NREM sleep cycles, and REM period and 

REM/NREM cycle lengths are similar to within a few 
minutes. 

Although some children with parentally reported risk 
for SDB were included in the present data, their average 
obstructive AI and variance is 3 times lower than that 
reported by Marcus et al,28,50 whereas the central AI 
reported here is several times higher.28 We suspect that 
the more narrowly focused age range and inclusion of a 
larger group of younger children may underlie the difference 
in central apneas, especially because there was a 
significantly higher central AI among the younger compared 
with older children in our sample. Only 1 published 
study was available for comparison of SpO2 baseline 
with a similar age group30 and was nearly identical 
to that reported here for older children. In studies encompassing 
slightly older children,35 the oxyhemoglobin 
saturation values were also similar to those reported 
here. 

Decreased AHIs were observed across age and paralleled 
the changes in sleep position throughout the night. 
We postulate that the decrease in central AIs with advancing 
age reflects a subtle process of maturation of the 
central nervous system. It is interesting to note that the 
decrease in central apnea with age accounted for the 
age-related decrease in AHI. 

The lowest median TAI reported in similar-aged children 
was 4 per hour of TST in children 6 to 7 years of 
age,33 and the highest was 9 per hour of TST in children 
5 to 7 years of age.31 Both of these values were derived 
from home-based studies. Laboratory-based studies have 
found median arousal indices ranging from 5 to 8 per 

TST,30,34,42,50

hour of which was consistent with the 
present report in which the higher respiratory-related 
arousal indices were recorded in NREM sleep stages 1 
and 2 as opposed to REM sleep. However, it was during 
REM sleep that most of the respiratory events occurred. 
These findings therefore may reflect differential state-
dependent arousal thresholds in these ages. SPS is a new 
numeric algorithm38 for intrapolysomnographic assessment 
of sleep disruption and resultant sleep pressure by

respiratory disturbances. This study not only expands 
the normative reference values for SPS, but also emphasizes 
the use of this measure as a practical and meaningful 
assessment of sleepiness in young children, considering 
the markedly small fraction of subjects in this 
healthy group with SPS .25. 

Several limitations inherent to this study deserve 
mention. First, the younger age group in the study was 
recruited predominantly from a low-income population. 
Although minority children who disproportionately 
make up this population are known to suffer more frequently 
from SDB, we are not aware of any studies 
showing either polysomnographic differences among 
normative children in high-versus low-income groups 
or of any showing differential response to polysomnography 
(first-night effects) between these groups. Although 
the younger group contained a higher proportion 
of black children, the effect sizes of the stage 1 and 
state 2 percent differences between these groups were 
trivial. We did find maternal education differences, 
which may be considered a proxy for socioeconomic 
status, on 3 measures. Effect size for latency to REM 
differences was small, but those for number of awakenings 
after sleep onset and stage 4 percent were large. 
Additional research into these effects may be warranted, 
but because only REM latency differed between our 
younger low-socioeconomic-status and older community 
children, these differences cannot be considered to 
alter the generalizability of the current report. 

Second, the accuracy of using a nasal cannula to 
measure ETCO2 has been questioned by a number of 
studies.43–45 Biologic factors such as tidal volume and 
respiratory rates as well as mechanical factors (diameter 
and length of the cannula and diameter of prongs) may 
influence the reliability of ETCO2 measurements. In addition, 
when compared with partial pressure of carbon 
dioxide values, studies in children have found that 
mouth breathing, airway obstruction, oxygen delivery 
through the ipsilateral nasal cannula, and cyanotic heart 
disease adversely affect the accuracy of ETCO2 measurements. 
In pediatric subjects without these factors, however, 
ETCO2 correlated well with partial pressure of carbon 
dioxide measurements. We now provide more 
extensive characterization of the anticipated normative 
distribution of ETCO2 in sleeping children, which are remarkably 
higher than previously reported.28,30 

Aside from a 1% difference in the percent of time 
spent in SpO2 range from 96% to 100%, we were unable 
to find differences on any cardiopulmonary measure 
between children whose parents report that they had 
asthma. However, parent report of asthma did not specify 
that the child had been clinically diagnosed with 
asthma or whether they were currently undergoing 
treatment for this condition. 

Finally, although statistically significant, the effect 
sizes for gender and ethnicity differences were quite

small, and therefore gender-based correction seems unnecessary 
at this time. Of note, the lack of gender and 
ethnicity differences is consistent with work by Quan et 
al.33 

With the relative growth of research activity focusing 
on pediatric sleep, multiple methods for recording sleep 
measures have been developed, including actigraphy 
and motility monitoring as well as polysomnography.46 
The “first-night” effects of polysomnographic monitoring 
on sleep characteristics are well-documented in 
adults, and although SDB indices do not seem vulnerable 
to first-night effects,47 the influence of a single night 
of disrupted sleep in children remains unknown. We 
restricted the analysis of the current data set to polysomnographic 
studies in which at least 6 hours of sleep were 
documented. Nevertheless, the percentage of overnight 
assessment excluded based on this criterion was 1%, 
suggesting that the normative parameters delineated in 
this study are commensurate with and applicable to the 
clinical setting. Although it is possible that transition to 
home-based polysomnographic testing may occur in the 
near future such as to facilitate access to more timely 
diagnosis and care in children, it is reassuring that many 
of the polysomnographic measures from our laboratory-
based study are similar to those recorded in the home, 
suggesting that the reference values delineated here 
should continue to serve as discriminatory guidelines for 
the presence of sleep disorders in children.
