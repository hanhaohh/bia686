Summary 


Background 
& 
aims: 
To 
evaluate 
the 
frequency 
of 
pulmonary 
function 
and 
sleep-
breathing 
disorders 
in 
severely 
obese 
children 
and 
to 
search 
for 
their 
association 
with 
obesity 
phenotypes. 
Methods: 
Sleep 
studies 
and 
spirometry 
were 
performed 
for 
54 
severely 
obese 
children. 
Results: 
Upper 
airway 
resistances 
(RAWs) 
were 
increased 
with 
RAW4200% 
and 
forced 
25 
s 
expiratory 
volumeo80% 
in 
83% 
and 
60% 
of 
individuals, 
respectively. 
A 
decrease 
in 
functional 
residual 
capacity 
(FRC)o80% 
was 
found 
in 
43%. 
Fifty-two 
percent 
of 
the 
children 
had 
a 
desaturation 
index410 
during 
sleep, 
and 
41% 
of 
children 
presented 
at 
least 
one 
of 
three 
severity 
criteria 
(snoring 
index4300 
per 
hour, 
respiratory 
events 
index 
(REI)410 
and 
arousal 
index410). 
Univariate 
analyses 
showed 
a 
positive 
correlation 
between 
snoring 
index 
and 
BMI 
Z-score 
and 
neck/ 
height 
ratio 
(P 
¼ 0:01 
and 
0:04, 
respectively) 
as 
between 
REI 
and 
the 
same 
parameters 
(P 
¼ 0:01 
and 
0:03, 
respectively). 
In 
a 
multivariate 
model 
with 
BMI 
Z-score, 
NHR 
still 
correlated 
with 
the 
snoring 
index 
(P 
¼ 0:02) 
and 
REI 
(P 
¼ 0:01). 
Conclusions: 
In 
our 
cohort, 
obese 
children 
showed 
frequent 
pulmonary 
function 
and 
sleep-breathing 
disorders. 
The 
later 
were

Introduction 


The 
prevalence 
of 
childhood 
obesity 
is 
increasing 
at 
an 
alarming 
rate 
in 
western 
countries 
resulting 
from 
an 
interaction 
between 
environmental 
factors 
and 
genes.1,2 
Childhood 
obesity 
is 
associated 
with 
morbidity 
and 
significant 
risk 
for 
the 
development 
of 
cardiovascular 
and 
related 
diseases 
in 
later 
life,3,4 
justifying 
the 
necessity 
to 
detect 
such 
complications 
as 
early 
as 
possible. 


In 
obese 
adults, 
both 
pulmonary 
function 
and 
sleep-breathing 
disorders 
are 
well 
known 
and 
are 
related 
to 
the 
severity 
of 
obesity.5 
The 
most 
frequently 
reported 
abnormalities 
in 
pulmonary 
function 
are 
reductions 
in 
lung 
volumes 
and 
expiratory 
flow 
rates, 
mainly 
caused 
by 
the 
mass 
of 
visceral 
fat, 
which 
show 
positive 
results 
following 
weight 
loss.6 
Sleeping 
disorders 
such 
as 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnoea 
(OSA) 
in 
obese 
adults 
are 
also 
a 
major 
problem 
because 
of 
increased 
cardiovascular 
and 
cerebrovascular 
morbidity.7 
Development 
of 
OSA 
is 
multifactorial, 
including 
body 
fat 
distribution, 
sex, 
and 
structural 
differences 
in 
upper 
airway 
dimensions.8,9 
There 
is 
also 
a 
link 
between 
OSA 
and 
insulin 
resistance,10 
and 
hyperleptinaemia 
is 
associated 
with 
OSA 
in 
obese 
adult 
patients 
independently 
of 
body 
mass 
index 
(BMI) 
suggesting 
a 
role 
of 
leptin 
resistance 
in 
obesity-related 
breathing 
disorders.11 


For 
children, 
the 
few 
studies 
that 
have 
evaluated 
the 
effect 
of 
obesity 
on 
pulmonary 
function 
have 
showed 
conflicting 
results. 
Reductions 
in 
functional 
residual 
capacity 
(FRC) 
and 
impaired 
diffusion 
have 
been 
described 
as 
the 
commonest 
abnormalities 
in 
obese 
children, 
with 
a 
correlation 
between 
the 
reduction 
in 
static 
lung 
volume 
and 
the 
degree 
of 
obesity.12 
However, 
others 
found 
that 
obstructive 
abnormalities 
were 
the 
main 
problem, 
while 
some 
studies 
did 
not 
detect 
significant 
pulmonary 
disorders.
13,14 
These 
conflicting 
results 
justify 
the 
necessity 
to 
explore 
pulmonary 
function 
in 
obese 
children 
to 
clarify 
the 
frequency 
and 
nature 
of 
such 
disorders. 


OSA 
episodes 
are 
prevalent 
in 
obese 
children, 
but 
they 
are 
less 
severe 
than 
in 
adults.13,15–19 
As 
in 
adults, 
the 
risk 
of 
developing 
OSA 
increases 
with 
the 
severity 
of 
obesity 
and 
is 
related 
to 
complications 
such 
as 
behavioural 
problems, 
learning 
difficulties, 
inhibition 
in 
normal 
growth 
patterns, 
cardiovascular 
abnormalities 
(elevated 
diastolic 
blood 
pressure)20 
and 
even 
insulin 
resistance.17 
However, 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
specific 
symptoms 
related 
to 
OSA 
except 
for 
snoring, 
such 
disorders 
could 
be 
underestimated 
in 
obese 
children 
with 
potential 
long-term 
consequences 
during 
later 
life, 
especially 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
specific 
therapeutic 


measures 
such 
as 
adenotonsillectomy 
or 
continuous 
positive 
airway 
pressure 
(CPAP).21 
In 
addition, 
the 
mechanisms 
inducing 
OSA 
in 
obese 
children 
are 
unknown 
except 
for 
the 
severity 
of 
obesity, 
as 
in 
adults, 
justifying 
the 
necessity 
to 
evaluate 
such 
disorders 
in 
obese 
children. 
Furthermore, 
only 
two 
studies 
have 
evaluated 
both 
pulmonary 
and 
nocturnal 
functions 
in 
the 
same 
group 
of 
such 
children.13,16 


The 
aim 
of 
our 
study 
was 
to 
evaluate 
the 
frequency 
of 
pulmonary 
function 
and 
sleep-breathing 
disorders 
in 
a 
cohort 
of 
severely 
obese 
children 
and 
to 
evaluate 
their 
association 
with 
clinical 
symptoms 
related 
to 
OSA, 
to 
the 
severity 
of 
obesity, 
to 
fat-mass 
repartition, 
and 
to 
metabolic 
complications. 


Material 
and 
methods 


Study 
population 


Fifty-four 
children 
with 
severe 
obesity 
were 
recruited 
consecutively 
and 
prospectively 
at 
our 
Outpatient 
Department 
of 
Paediatric 
Nutrition 
from 
2002 
to 
2004 
(Table 
1). 
Severe 
obesity 
was 
defined 
as 
a 
BMI 
Z-score43 
SD 
over 
mean 
age-and 
sex-specific 
BMI 
values 
determined 
in 
French 
children 
by 
Rolland-Cachera.22 
Patients 
with 
syndromic 
obesity 
such 
as 
Prader–Willi 
or 
Laurence–Moon–
Biedl 
syndromes, 
were 
excluded. 
All 
included 
patients 
were 
recruited 
for 
severe 
obesity 
with 
or 
without 
nocturnal 
and 
diurnal 
symptoms 
of 
OSA. 
Informed 
consent 
was 
obtained 
from 
all 
subjects 
and 
ethical 
approval 
was 
granted 
by 
the 
local 
ethics 
committees. 


Clinical 
measurements 


All 
patients 
and 
their 
parents 
underwent 
an 
interview 
by 
a 
paediatrician 
using 
a 
formal 
questionnaire 
regarding 
their 
history 
of 
morning 
headaches, 
diurnal 
somnolence, 
agitated 
sleep, 
snoring, 
nocturnal 
perspiration 
and 
previous 
history 
of 
asthma. 
A 
physical 
examination 
was 
performed 
on 
all 
children 
to 
take 
anthropometric 
measurements 
(weight, 
height 
and 
neck 
circumference) 
and 
for 
the 
evaluation 
of 
pubertal 
development 
using 
Tanner 
stages. 
Patients 
provided 
information 
about 
their 
ethnicity. 
Because 
larger 
necks 
are 
to 
be 
expected 
in 
taller 
patients, 
neck 
circumference 
was 
normalized 
for 
body 
height 
by 
calculating 
the 
neck/height 
ratio 
(NHR). 
An 
oscillometric 
technique 
was 
used 
to 
measure 
brachial 
blood 
pressure 
in 
children 
after 
they 
had 
been 
lying 
down 
for 
10 
min.

Body 
fat 
mass 
was 
measured 
in 
46 
of 
the 
children 
by 
whole-body 
dual-energy 
X-ray 
absorptiometry 
(Hologic 
QDR 
2000 
unit, 
Hologic, 
Inc., 
Waltham,

Body 
fat 
distribution 
was 
defined 
as 
the 
android/gynoid 
fat-mass 
ratio 
(A/G 
r), 
calculated 
as 
the 
ratio 
of 
the 
amount 
of 
fat 
in 
the 
trunk 
over 
the 
amount 
of 
fat 
in 
the 
leg. 


Laboratory 
tests 


Blood 
samples 
were 
collected 
from 
all 
children 
after 
an 
overnight 
fast. 
Total 
cholesterol 
and 
triglycerides 
were 
measured 
using 
an 
enzymatic 
assay 
(Boehringer 
Mannheim, 
Germany). 
Plasma 
leptin 
levels 
were 
measured 
by 
radioimmunoassay 
(LINCO 
Research, 
Inc., 
St. 
Louis, 
MO, 
USA). 
Fasting 
plasma 
glucose 
and 
plasma 
insulin 
levels 
were 
determined 
by 
the 
glucose 
oxidase 
method, 
and 
a 
radioimmunoassay 
with 
polyclonal 
antibodies 
(INSIPR, 
CIS 
Bio 
International, 
Gif-sur-Yvette, 
France), 
respectively. 
We 
used 
the 
homeostasis 
model 
assessment 
index 
(HOMA) 
as 
the 
insulin 
resistance 


index, 
defined 
as 
(fasting 
insulin 
level 
fasting 
glucose 
level) 
divided 
by 
22.5.23 


Pulmonary 
studies 


Pulmonary 
function 
study 
included 
in 
all 
children 
measurements 
of 
vital 
capacity 
(VC), 
FRC 
by 
the 
helium 
dilution 
technique 
and 
blood 
gases 
with 
arterialized 
blood 
samples 
(PaO2 
and 
PaCO2) 
and 
pulse 
oxymetry 
saturation 
(StcO2). 
In 
addition, 
in 
cooperating 
children 
with 
age46 
years 
(n 
¼ 35), 
we 
performed 
measurements 
of 
airway 
resistance 
(RAW) 
by 
the 
interruption 
technique 
with 
maximal 
inspiratory 
(PImax) 
and 
expiratory 
(PEmax) 
pressures 
at 
FRC, 
force 
expiratory 
volume 
in 
1 
s 
(FEV1), 
and 
forced 
expiratory 
flow 
in 
1 
s 
at 
25% 
of 
the 
VC 
forced 
expiratory 
flow 
in 
25 
s 
(FEF25). 


Results 
were 
expressed 
as 
percentage 
of 
predicted 
values 
for 
height 
for 
VC, 
FRC, 
and 
RAW 
and 
for 
age 
for 
PImax,PEmax 
and 
blood 
gazes.24–26 
Values 
were 
considered 
as 
abnormal 
when 
they 
were 
lower 
than 
80% 
of 
the 
predicted 
values 
for 
VC 
and 
FRC 
or 
higher 
than 
200% 
for 
RAW. 
A 
decrease 
in 
PImax 
or 
PEmax 
to 
under 
50% 
of 
predicted 
values, 
and 
a 
decrease 
in 
FEV1 
or 
FEF25 
to 
under 
80% 
were 
considered 
as 
pathological. 
A 
decrease 
in 
PaO2 
and 
an 
increase 
in 
PaCO2 
of 
more 
than 
two 
standard 
deviations 
were 
each 
considered 
as 
pathological, 
as 
was 
a 
decrease 
in 
StcO2 
of 
more 
than 
3%. 


Sleep 
studies 


Polysomnographic 
studies 
were 
performed 
overnight, 
in 
a 
quiet 
room. 
No 
sedation 
or 
sleep 
deprivation 
was 
used. 
One 
parent 
accompanied 
preadolescent 
children 
throughout 
the 
night. 


Data 
were 
recorded 
on 
a 
digital 
acquisition 
system 
(CIDELEC). 
Sleep 
staging 
was 
determined 
using 
electroencephalograms 
(EEGs), 
electro-oculograms, 
and 
submental 
electromyograms 
(EMGs). 
Respiratory 
variables 
were 
assessed 
by 
means 
of 
abdominal 
and 
thoracic 
straps, 
microphone 
and 
nasal 
flow 
pressure. 
Ventilatory 
status 
was 
evaluated 
by 
pulse 
oxymeter 
(StcO2) 
and 
transcutaneous 
carbon 
dioxide 
(PtcCO2 
radiometer) 
which 
was 
available 
in 
our 
laboratory 
and 
well 
accepted 
by 
children. 


A 
pathological 
desaturation 
index 
was 
defined 
as 
a 
number 
of 
rapid 
falls 
of 
3% 
in 
SaO2 
greater 
or 
equal 
to 
10/h. 
For 
PtcCO2, 
we 
used 
only 
the 
maximal 
PtcCO2 
during 
sleep. 
Arousal 
index 
was 
defined 
by 
the 
number 
of 
marked 
increases 
measured 
for 
43 
s 
ando15 
s 
in 
EEG 
frequency 
per 
hour, 
associated 
with 
an 
increase 
in 
EMG 
tone 
and 
a 
marked 
variability 
in 
respiratory 
efforts 
and 
nasal

airflow. 
The 
respiratory 
event 
index 
(REI) 
was 
defined 
as 
the 
number 
of 
episodes 
of 
apnoea/ 
hypopnoea 
per 
hour. 
Apnoea 
was 
defined 
as 
absence 
of 
airflow 
at 
nose 
and 
mouth 
for 
410 
s 
and 
hypopnea 
as 
a 
marked 
decrease 
450% 
in

Discussion 


We 
evaluated 
the 
frequency 
of 
pulmonary 
function 
and 
sleep-breathing 
disorders 
in 
this 
cohort 
of 
severely 
obese 
children 
and 
searched 
for 
their 
association 
with 
specific 
phenotypes 
related 
to 
obesity. 
We 
found 
that 
both 
were 
already 
frequent 
in 
severely 
obese 
children, 
and 
that 
impaired 
respiratory 
conductance 
in 
upper 
airways 
was 
the 
main 
factor 
related 
to 
OSA 
in 
severely 
obese 
children. 


In 
this 
study, 
we 
showed 
that 
OSA 
was 
a 
major 
concern 
in 
these 
obese 
children. 
We 
used 
an 
REI 
threshold410 
to 
define 
OSA, 
a 
threshold 
higher 
than 
in 
previous 
studies.13,18 
In 
adults, 
and 
especially 
in 
children, 
there 
is 
no 
consensus 
on 
the 
threshold 
level 
of 
REI 
that 
best 
identifies 
the 
severity 
of 
OSA 
because 
levels 
ranging 
from 
5 
to 
30 
have 
been 
used 
in 
different 
studies 
and 
clinical 
settings.20,27 
A 
threshold 
of 
410 
allowed 
us 
to 
identify 
children 
with 
at 
least 
a 
moderate 
degree 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing.

children 
presented 
with 
criteria 
for 
OSA, 
which 
is 
still 
much 
lower 
than 
in 
obese 
adults, 
in 
whom 
40% 
are 
affected.28 


In 
our 
study, 
72% 
of 
the 
children 
had 
at 
least 
one 
abnormality 
during 
sleep 
study 
(desaturation 
index410 
and/or 
hypercapnia450 
mmHg 
and/or 
one 
of 
three 
severity 
criteria 
defined 
earlier). 
This 
high 
frequency 
of 
sleep 
disturbances 
in 
our 
cohort 
compared 
with 
the 
findings 
of 
others 
in 
children13,15,17 
could 
be 
because 
our 
study 
included 
only 
patients 
with 
severe 
obesity 
(BMI 
Z-score43SD). 


We 
found 
that 
NHR 
and 
RAW 
correlated 
with 
snoring 
index 
and 
REI. 
This 
confirms 
that 
upper 
airway 
abnormalities 
are 
involved 
in 
the 
development 
of 
sleep 
disturbances 
in 
obese 
children, 
as 
they 
are 
in 
adults. 
Repartition 
of 
fat 
mass, 
especially 
parapharyngeal 
fat 
deposits 
or 
neck 
circumference, 
is 
related 
to 
sleep 
apnoea 
in 
adults.29 
Increased 
fat 
deposition 
in 
this 
region 
promotes 
pharyngeal 
collapse 
by 
increased 
positive 
pressure 
outside 
the 
airway, 
leading 
to 
OSA.29 
In 
addition, 
the 
decrease 
in 
expiratory 
flow 
rates 
(FEF25) 
and 
the 
increased 
RAW 
in 
our 
cohort 
showed 
the 
additional 
role 
of 
lower 
and 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
in 
the 
development 
of 
OSA, 
as 
suggested 
elsewhere 
for 
both 
adults 
and 
children.16,30 


The 
correlation 
found 
between 
insulin 
resistance 
and 
arousal 
index 
was 
no 
more 
significant 
after 
adjustment 
for 
age, 
sex, 
ethnicity 
and 
Tanner 
stage. 
This 
suggests 
that 
the 
strong 
correlation 
between 
severity 
of 
OSA 
and 
insulin 
resistance 
observed 
by 
de 
la 
Eva 
et 
al.17 
might 
have 
also 
disappeared 
if 
adjustments 
for 
age 
or 
Tanner 
stages 
had 
been 
done. 


No 
association 
was 
found 
between 
clinical 
symptoms 
described 
as 
related 
to 
OSA 
in 
adults 
and 
sleep 
study 
results. 
This 
could 
be 
because 
of 
the 
small 
number 
of 
patients 
and 
to 
the 
absence 
of 
validated 
questionnaires 
for 
children.20 
Despite 
the 
lack 
of 
association 
in 
our 
study, 
it 
seems 
important 
to 
inquire 
about 
such 
symptoms 
in 
obese 
children 
to 
detect 
OSA 
as 
early 
as 
possible. 


In 
our 
cohort, 
52% 
of 
the 
children 
had 
a 
number 
of 
severe 
desaturations 
of 
10/h 
or 
more 
with 
hypercapnia 
(PaCO2450 
mmHg) 
in 
15%. 
In 
such 
patients, 
large 
reductions 
in 
the 
PaO2 
with 
increases 
of 
PaCO2 
during 
sleep 
apnoea 
are 
associated 
with 
increases 
in 
sympathetic 
nervous 
activity, 
leading 
to 
repetitive 
profound 
acute 
increases 
in 
systemic 
blood 
pressure 
during 
the 
night.31 
Chronically, 
this 
situation 
can 
lead 
to 
periods 
of 
high 
blood 
pressure 
probably 
through 
sustained 
sympathetic 
excitation, 
reduced 
parasympathetic 
activity, 
and 
release 
of 
endothelin.31 
This 
underlines 
the 
risk 
of 
long-term 
morbidity 
and 
the 
need 
to 
detect 
sleep 
disorders 
as 
early 
as 
possible 
in 
obese 
children. 


Pulmonary 
dysfunctions 
were 
frequent 
in 
our 
cohort. 
Decreases 
in 
FRC 
and 
FEF25 
and 
increase 
in 
RAW 
were 
the 
commonest 
abnormalities 
found, 
as 
previously 
described 
for 
obese 
adults 
and 
chil


dren.5,12,32,33 


Fat-mass 
repartition, 
especially 
android 
fat-mass 
deposit 
with 
increase 
in 
RAW 
is 
a 
major 
mechanism.12 
However, 
we 
were 
not 
able 
to 
find 
correlations 
between 
pulmonary 
abnormalities 
and 
android 
fat 
mass 
in 
our 
cohort, 
perhaps 
because 
of 
the 
small 
number 
of 
patients. 
Further 
studies 
are 
necessary 
in 
a 
larger 
cohort 
to 
confirm 
these 
results. 


In 
conclusion, 
we 
found 
that 
abnormalities 
in 
pulmonary 
function 
and 
sleep-breathing 
disorders 
were 
frequent 
in 
our 
cohort 
of 
obese 
children. 
Sleep 
disturbances 
and 
especially 
OSA 
are 
already 
a 
main 
concern 
in 
obese 
children. 
Their 
development 
is 
linked 
to 
body 
fat 
distribution, 
especially 
in 
the 
upper 
airways, 
and 
to 
decreased 
respiratory 
conductance 
caused 
by 
diffuse 
airway 
obstruction. 
Surprisingly, 
despite 
the 
high 
frequency 
of 
OSA 
in 
obese 
children, 
specific 
nasal 
treatment 
is 
rarely 
indicated, 
as 
there 
is 
continuous 
positive 
airway 


13,34

pressure.Further 
studies 
are 
essential 
to 
evaluate 
the 
indications 
of 
CPAP 
in 
such 
patients. 
Earlier 
detection 
and 
the 
more 
precise 
evaluation 
of 
long-term 
consequences 
of 
OSA 
among 
obese 
children 
will 
be 
helpful 
to 
identify 
if 
specific 
therapeutics 
should 
be 
used 
more 
frequently.
