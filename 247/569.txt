Abstract 
Obesity is associated with the development of 
hypertension but it is still not clear why hypertension is 
not observedin allobesepatients. Obesityisariskfactor 
for the development of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome 
(OSAS) in children. OSAS has been linked to the development
 of hypertension in adults and children. The purpose
 of this study was to test the hypothesis that OSAS is 
one of the reasons that some obese children are hypertensive
 and some are not. The overnight polysomnography 
records of 90 patients (aged 4.2–18.8 years) were reviewed.
 BMIscore [body mass index (BMI)/95thpercentile 
BMIfor age, sex, and race] was usedto express the degree 
of obesity. The severity of systolic hypertension and diastolic
 hypertension were expressed as SBPscore (systolic 
BP/the 95thpercentile systolic BP for age, sex, and height) 
and DBPscore (diastolic BP/the 95thpercentile diastolic BP 
for age, sex, andheight), respectively. OSAS was defined

Introduction 


The incidence of obesity has increased significantly in the 
past 2 decades with an estimated prevalence of 13% in 
children aged 6–11 years and 14% in adolescents aged 
12–19 years [1]. In adults, obesity is associated with the 
development of hypertension [2] and an increased risk of 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) [3]. Likewise, hypertension 
is a risk factor for CVD in adults [4]. Since 25%–50% of 
obese adolescents remain obese into adulthood [5] and 
childhood hypertension is associated with the future development
 of systolic hypertension in adulthood [6, 7], it 
is likely that obese children with hypertension will have 
an increased risk for CVD and morbidity compared with 


those children who are obese but normotensive. Although 
the long-term outcome of obese children with hypertension
 is not known, cerebral hemorrhage and heart disease 
have been described in obese hypertensive adolescents 
within a 10-year follow-up period [8]. While the association
 between obesity and hypertension has been attributed
 to an impaired pressure natriuresis [9], it is not 
clear why hypertension is not observed in all obese 
children. Exploration of its mechanisms will allow us to 
take measures to prevent the development of hypertension 
in obese children such that their future CVD risk can be 
reduced. 

Obesity is a risk factor for the development of obstructive
 sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in children and 
adolescents [10, 11]. There is an increased incidence of 
OSAS in obese children [12]. OSAS has also been linked 
to the development of hypertension in adults, and there is 
an increased incidence of hypertension in adult patients 
with OSAS [13, 14]. Adult patients with OSAS have a 
higher incidence of hypertension, independent of their 
age, sex, body mass index (BMI), or waist and neck circumferences,
 than those without OSAS after a 4-year 
follow-up period [15]. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated
 that OSAS is an independent predictor for sustained
 hypertension in adults [16]. A direct cause-effect 
link between OSAS and hypertension is supported by the 
findings that chronic application of continuous positive 
airway pressure to hypertensive OSAS patients results in 
reduction of blood pressure (BP) [17, 18]. It is possible 
that OSAS is associated with an increased risk of hypertension
 in obese children. To test this hypothesis, we 
retrospectively reviewed the data of overnight sleep 
studies in pediatric patients and compared the incidence 
of OSAS between obese hypertensive children and obese 
normotensive children. 

Materials 
and 
methods 


This study was approved by the University and Medical Center 
Institutional Review Board of East Carolina University, North 
Carolina. Records of overnight sleep studies between October 2000 
and January 2003 from 130 pediatric patients were reviewed. After 
exclusion of patients with renal failure, transplantation, mental 
retardation, neuromuscular diseases, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung 
disease, congenital heart disease, sickle cell disease, or antihypertensive
 therapy, data from 90 patients were included for analysis. 
These patients were referred by their primary physicians for sleep 
study because of their clinical presentation. Their symptoms included
 daytime hypersomnolence (72%), snoring (91%), difficult 
breathing (30%), sweating (11%), apnea (36%), frequent arousal 
(13%), restless sleep (28%), and mouth breathing (12%) during 
sleep. Patients were interviewed in the sleep clinic where their 
medical history, weight, height, and manual BP (single measurement
 according to the guidelines of the 1996 Task Force) were 
obtained. If the sleep study was indicated, it was performed within 
1 month of the clinic visit. 

Patients were admitted to the Sleep Center at Pitt County 
Memorial Hospital (Greenville, N.C.) for overnight polysomnographic
 (PSG) study performed according to the recommendations 
of the American Thoracic Society [19]. One parent was asked to 
stay with the patient. Data from air oronasal flow, electroencephalogram
 (EEG), electrocardiogram, electrooculogram, tibial and 

submental electromyogram, chest and abdominal motion, pulse 
oximeter, and end-tidal PCO2 were recorded continuously on PSG 
(Nihon Kohden, Japan). Apnea was defined as a greater than 50% 
reduction of airflow with a minimum duration of 10 s and an associated
 desaturation of 3% or greater, and/or a sleep arousal. 
Hypopnea was defined as a 20%–50% reduction in airflow with a 
minimum duration of 10 s and an associated desaturation of 3% or 
greater, and/ora sleep arousal. EEG arousal was defined asa higher 
frequency shiftin EEG lasting more than3 s. The arousal index was 
the number of EEG arousals per hour of sleep as a result of apnea, 
periodic limb movement, or snoring. The sampling rate of the pulse 
oximeter was 1/s. Maximal O2 desaturation (%) was the maximal 
decline in oxygen saturation from the baseline level during sleep. 
The apnea index (AI) was the episodes of central, mixed, and obstructive
 apnea per hour of sleep. The hypopnea index (HI) was the 
episodes of hypopnea per hour of sleep. The apnea-hypopnea index 
(AHI) was the sum of AI and HI. Patients were diagnosed with 
OSAS if the AI was >1 or if the lowest O2 saturation associated 
with obstructive apnea was less than 90%, as suggested by Marcus 
et al. [20]. 

Hypertension was defined as systolic (SBP) or diastolic blood 
pressure (DBP) equal to or greater than 95th percentile for age, sex, 
and height according to the reference values of Rosner et al. [21]. 
Obesity was defined as a BMI equal to or greater than the 95th 
percentile for age, sex, and race according to the published data for 
American children [22, 23]. To express the degree of obesity, we 
used the BMI score (BMIscore), which is the ratio of BMI to the 95th 
percentile BMI for age, sex, and race in this study. Similarly, we 
used SBP score (SBPscore), which is the ratio of systolic BP to the 
95th percentile systolic BP for age, sex, and height, and DBP score 
(DBPscore), which is the ratio of diastolic BP to the 95th percentile 
diastolic BP for age, sex, and height, to express the severity of 
hypertension. 

Statistics 

All data are mean€SD. Yates corrected chi-squared test or Mann-
Whitney U test was used to compare the difference between two 
groups when appropriate. Spearman’s rank order test was used to 
examine correlations between the variables. Forward stepwise 
multiple regression analysis was used to examine significant independent
 predictors of the dependent variable. A P<0.05 was 
considered statistically significant. 

Results 


The mean age of the 58 males and 32 females studied 
was 10.7 years (range 4.2–18.8 years). Their BMI was 
28.2€11.1 kg/m2. There were 58 African-American patients,
 31 Caucasians, and 1 of Hispanic origin; 25 patients
 had a history of asthma. There were 56 obese patients
 (62%) and 42 (47%) had either systolic or diastolic 
hypertension. 

Forty patients (44%) were diagnosed with OSAS. All 
OSAS patients had symptoms of snoring and/or hyper-
somnolence. There was no significant difference between 
patients with(n=40) and without(n=50) OSAS in their 
age (10.0€3.9 vs. 11.2€3.6 years), sex (male/female 29/11 
vs. 29/21), race (Caucasian/African-American 12/27 vs. 
19/31), and the percentage of patients with asthma (23% 
vs. 32%). As shown in Table 1, the incidences of hypertension
 (68%) and obesity (75%) was significantly 
higher in OSAS patients, as demonstrated by their higher 
BMIscore, SBPscore, and DBPscore.OfOSAS patients, there 
were 14 patients with isolated systolic hypertension, 4

Correlation analysis of all patients is presented in 
Table 2. There was no correlation between BMIscore, 
SBPscore, DBPscore, or any PSG variable with age (data not 
shown). There was no correlation between the maximal 
O2 desaturation and SBPscore, DBPscore, or BMIscore. Both 
SBPscore and DBPscore correlated positively with BMIscore, 
arousal index, HI, and AHI. Similarly, BMIscore correlated 
positively with arousal index, HI, and AHI. To examine 
the independent predictors of SBPscore or DBPscore, forward
 stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed 
in all patients using BMIscore, arousal index, HI, and AHI 
as independent variables. Data of these PSG variables 
were log transformed [log10(data+1)] before the analysis 
because of their skewed distribution. For SBPscore, this 
model explained 40% of its variability. BMIscore was the 
only significant predictor of SBPscore, which explained 
38% of its variability(b=0.55, P=0.000). For DBPscore, 
this model explained 38% of its variability. BMIscore 
alone explained 35% of variability (b=0.51, P=0.000). 
The addition of HI explained another 3% of variability 
that was significant(b=0.19, P=0.044). These results in-

another significant determinant of DBPscore, it only accounted
 for a small amount of variability. 

Data of non-obese and obese patients are shown in 
Table 3. There was no significant difference between their 
age, male/female ratio, racial distribution, incidence of 
asthma, or maximalO2 desaturation during sleep (data not 
shown). Compared with non-obese patients, obese patients
 had a higher incidence of hypertension (70%) and 
OSAS (54%) and a higher BMIscore, SBPscore, DBPscore, 
arousal index, HI, and AHI. Of the 39 obese patients with 
hypertension, 25 had OSAS (64%) and 2 of the 3 non-
obese patients with hypertension had OSAS. Of the obese 
patients, 22 had isolated systolic hypertension, 13 had 
both systolic and diastolic hypertension, and4 had isolated
 diastolic hypertension. In the non-obese group, 1 
patient had isolated systolic hypertension, 1 patient had 
both systolic and diastolic hypertension, and 1 patient 
had isolated diastolic hypertension. Obese patients had a 
higher incidence of systolic hypertension (63% vs. 6%, 
P<0.05), diastolic hypertension (30% vs. 6%, P<0.05), 
and OSAS (54% vs. 29%, P<0.05) than the non-obese 
patients. 

The correlation analysis of BP and other variables in 
obese patients is presented in Table 4. Both SBPscore and 
DBPscore correlated positively with BMIscore, arousal 
index, and HI. In addition, DBPscore correlated positively 
with AHI. BMIscore correlated positively with arousal 
index, maximal O2 desaturation, and AHI. There was 
no correlation between age and SBPscore, DBPscore,or 
BMIscore (data not shown). Forward stepwise multiple

regression analysis for the determinants of SBPscore and

HI, and AHI as independent variables. Data of these 
PSG variables were log transformed [log10(data+1)] before
 the analysis because of their skewed distribution. For 
SBPscore, this model explained 23% of its variability. 
BMIscore alone accounted for 14% of the variability 
(b=0.33, P=0.004). Addition of HI added another 7% of 
variability(b=0.42), which was significant(P=0.04). For 
DBPscore, this model accounted for a total of 28% variability.
HI alone explained 18%of the variability(b=0.32, 
P=0.01). Addition of BMIscore explained another 10% of 
the variabilityin DBPscore, which was significant(b=0.34, 
P=0.001). In non-obese patients, except for a positive 
correlation between BMIscore and arousal index, there was 
no correlation of SBPscore, DBPscore, or BMIscore with any 
of the PSG variables examined (data not shown). 

We next compared the data of hypertensive and normotensive
 patients in the obese group. There was no 
difference in their age (11.0€3.4 vs. 11.1€4.0 years), sex 
(male/female 24/15 vs. 11/6), race (Caucasian/African-
American 12/27 vs. 7/10), incidence of asthma (26% vs. 
24%), BMIscore (1.38€0.3 vs. 1.30€0.28), or maximalO2 
desaturation (10.3€7.9 vs. 9.97€8.8%). As shown in Table
 5, obese and hypertensive patients had a higher incidence
 of OSAS (64%) than the obese and normotensive 
patients (29%). Among the PSG variables examined, 
higher HI and AHI were seen in hypertensive patients. 
Both HI and BMIscore were significant independent predictors
 of SBPscore and DBPscore. 

Discussion 


There are only a few studies examining the association of 
hypertension and OSAS in pediatric patients. Guilleminault
 et al. [24] reported five children with sleep apnea 
and hypertension. BP was normalized after tonsillectomy 
and adenoidectomy (T and A) in three patients and after 
tracheotomy in two patients. Serratto et al. [25] described 
three pediatric patients with severe hypertension and right 
heart failure. Two had normal BP after T and A and the 
other after tracheotomy. Ross et al. [26] described the 
resolution of left ventricular hypertrophy and a reduced 
antihypertensive medication after T and A and tracheotomy
 in one child with sleep apnea. While these reports 

support a link between OSAS and hypertension, cases are 
few and most have severe OSAS and hypertension. 
Marcus et al. [20] examined the nocturnal BP in 41 
children with OSAS (AI3) and 26 children with primary 
snoring. BPindex was calculated as the difference between 
the measured BP and the 95th percentile BP for age, 
gender, and height.A higher DBPindex, but not SBPindex, 
was found in OSAS children during wakefulness or sleep. 
BMI was an independent predictor of SBPindex while age, 
AI, and BMI were independent predictors of DBPindex.It 
was concluded that the degree of diastolic hypertension is 
related to the severity of OSAS and the degree of obesity. 
Kohyama et al. [27] studied nocturnal BP in 23 children. 
Higher SBPindex and DBPindex were noted in those children
 with an AHI of more than 10. Age, BMI, and AHI 
were significant predictors of SBPindex during REM sleep. 
It was concluded that nocturnal SBP correlated with the 
degree of OSAS. 

To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the 
first to examine the association between office BP and 
OSAS in obese children. Similar to the findings of Marcus
 et al. [20] and Kohyama et al. [27], BMI was a significant
 determinant of SBP and DBP in our study when 
both obese and non-obese patients were included in the 
analysis. However, instead of AI or AHI, we found HI 
wasa significant predictorof DBPscorein all patients. This 
discrepancy may be related to the following factors. Our 
study examined the daytime office BP when patients were 
not sleeping, while their studies examined nocturnal BP at 
the time of OSAS. Circadian changes in BP may affect 
the results of analysis. Our definition of hypopnea is 
different from that of Marcus et al. [20], which could have 
affected the incidence and results of sleep studies [28].A 
significant proportion of our patients were obese (62%), 
which is higher than that the 13% in the study of Kohyama
 et al. [27] and the 27% in the study of Marcus et al. 
[20]. Furthermore, it has been shown that children with 
OSAS usually present with prolonged periods of partial 
upper airway obstruction and fewer and shorter episodes 
of complete obstruction [29, 30]. It should be noted that 
while the use of BPindex by these investigators was to 
avoid the age difference in BP levels, SBPindex or 
DBPindex was still related to age in their studies. In our 
study, SBPscore, DBPscore, or BMIscore was not related to 
age. 

We observed a high incidence of obesity (75%) in 
patients with OSAS (Table 1). This is comparable to the 
reported 60%–70% incidence of obesity in adults with 
OSAS [31]. Mallory et al. [32] described obesity in 37% 
of 41 children with a history suggestive of OSAS. However,
 obesity was defined as a body weight more than 
150% ideal weight in their study, which is different from 
our criteria for obesity. In our patients, BMIscore correlated
 positively with arousal index, HI, or AHI. This is 
consistent with the study of Redline et al. [10], which 
reported that obesity is a risk factor for OSAS. Mechanisms
 underlying the association between obesity and 
OSAS are not clear. It has been hypothesized that obesity 
affects breathing during sleep through alteration of upper 


airway structure and function, obesity related hypoxemia, 
or an abnormal ventilatory drive [33]. 

The incidence of hypertension in our patients with 
OSAS was 68% (Table 1). Guilleminault et al. [34] reported
 anincidenceofhypertensionof8%in50 children 
with OSAS. However, 26 of these children had underlying 
anatomical or neuromuscular disorders that could have 
affected their BP levels. The difference in BP reference 
values between their study and ours could also have 
contributed to the difference in the incidence of hypertension.
 In our study, HI was a significant independent 
predictorofDBPscore when all patients wereincluded for 
analysis. Results from the Wisconsin study [16] suggest 
that AHI is an independent risk factor for hypertension. 
Ourfindingsare comparabletotheirssincehypopneaisa 
more-common presentation than apnea in children with 
OSAS[29,30].Experimentsindogs have demonstrateda 
direct cause-effect relationship between OSAS and a 
sustained daytime hypertension [35]. Episodic hypoxia in 
rats resulted in sustained hypertension that could be 
blocked by carotid body denervation, sympathetic nerve 
ablation, renal sympathectomy, adrenal medullectomy, 
and an angiotensin-1 receptor blocker, suggesting an 
overactivity of the adrenergic and renin-angiotensin system
 from intermittent hypoxia [36]. An increased sympathetic
 drive as a result ofintermittent hypoxia [37]and/ 
or arousal [38] has been linked to the development of 
hypertension in adults with OSAS. Treatment with continuous
 positive airway pressure in adults with OSAS 
decreases their sympathetic nerve activity [39, 40]. Other 
hypothesized mechanisms underlying the association between
 OSAS and hypertension include dysfunction of the 
vascular endothelium [41], altered corticotropic function 
[42], and insulin resistance [43]. 

The degree of obesity correlated strongly with the 
severity of systolic or diastolic hypertension when both 
our obese and non-obese patients were included for 
analysis (Table 2). An impaired renal pressure natriuresis 
has been suggested to play a central role in obesity induced
 hypertension [9]. Factors such as insulin resistance, 
endothelial dysfunction, activation of the renin-angiotensin
 system, increased sympathetic nervous system activity,
 renal structural changes, or altered hypothalamic-
pituitary-adrenal axis have been implicated in its pathogenesis
 [44]. It is noteworthy that these pathogenic factors 
are very similar to those described earlier for the hypertension
 in OSAS. The interactions between mechanisms 
underlying the association between obesity and hypertension
 and the association between OSAS and hypertension
 are likely complicated and remain to be elucidated.
 

The incidence of OSAS in our obese patients was 54% 
(Table 3). Silvestri et al. [45] reported OSAS in 59% of 
32 obese children. Kahn et al. [46] reported that seven of 
ten overweight infants have disordered breathing during 
sleep. Our data are comparable to theirs. In our obese 
patients (Table 4), HI was a significant independent predictor
 of SBPscore and DBPscore. Although BMIscore was 
also a significant independent predictor of both BP scores, 

there was no significant difference in BMIscore between 
normotensive and hypertensive obese patients (Table 5). 
These findings suggest that, in addition to BMI, hypopnea 
correlates significantly with the degree of hypertension in 
our obese patients. Although these findings do not necessarily
 indicate a cause-effect relationship between hypopnea
 and the development of hypertension in these 
patients, they are consistent with the hypothesis that 
OSAS may play a significant role and may explain why 
only some obese children are hypertensive. 

It has been suggested that the baseline BP is variable 
among individuals, due to genetic differences or other 
factors that influence BP regulation. An increase in BP 
from weight gain results in different BP levels in the 
population, and so some are hypertensive and some are not 
accordingtothepopulationstandard[44]. Thishypothesis 
issupportedbythefindingthatweight lossreducesBPin 
adults with a high or normal BP [47], although this BP-
lowering effect of weight loss is not observed in every 
adult [48]. Another possibility is that while the baseline 
BP levels are similar among individuals with the same 
body mass, different individuals respond differently to 
weight gain due to genetic factors. Our findings are 
not necessarily at variance with these hypotheses. Genetic 
factors, such as family clustering [49], human leukocyte 
antigen typing [50], and ethnicity [10], have been implicated
 in the pathophysiology of OSAS. Different genetic 
risk for OSAS results in different baseline BP levels in 
children. An increase in BP due to obesity results in differentBPlevelsinthepopulation,
 suchthat somechildren 
are hypertensive and some are not according to the population
 standard. An alternative explanation for our observationisthat
 obesity causes some children withgenetic 
risks for OSAS to develop significant hypopnea during 
sleep. This in turn elevates their BP further. This, however,
 remains to be validated. 

In summary, our study demonstrates that the degree of 
obesity is a significant determinant of PSG variables and 
the severity of systolic and diastolic hypertension in our 
patients. In our obese patients, there is a higher incidence 
of OSAS in those who are hypertensive compared with 
those who are normotensive. In addition, the HI during 
sleep is a significant determinant of the severity of systolic
 or diastolic hypertension. These findings are consistent
 with the hypothesis that OSAS is one of the reasons
 why some children are hypertensive and some are 
not. It should be noted that our data are based on a referral 
population. The findings are not necessarily applicable to 
the general population. Prospective studies, both cross-
sectional and longitudinal, on a non-selected population 
of children are needed to confirm our findings.
