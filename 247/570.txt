Rationale: 
Metabolic 
syndrome 
(MetS) 
affects 
4 
to 
10% 
of 
adolescents. 
Risk 
factors 
include 
overweight, 
male 
sex, 
and 
Hispanic 
ethnicity. 
Although 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
(SDB) 
has 
been 
implicated 
as 
a 
risk 
factor 
for 
MetS 
in 
adults, 
its 
association 
with 
SDB 
in 
adolescents 
is 
unknown. 
Objectives: 
To 
define 
the 
association 
of 
SDB 
with 
MetS 
in 
adolescents. 
Methods: 
Standardized 
measurements 
of 
SDB, 
anthropometry 
and 
bioassays, 
were 
made 
in 
270 
adolescents, 
aged 
13.6 
. 
0.7 
years. 
MetS 
was 
identified 
if 
threshold 
levels 
were 
exceeded 
in 
three 
of 
five 
areas: 
waist 
circumference, 
blood 
pressure, 
triglyceride 
level, 
high-density 
lipoprotein 
cholesterol 
level, 
and 
glucose 
levels. 
Measurements 
and 
Main 
Results: 
Although 
70% 
of 
children 
with 
SDB 
(apnea–hypopnea 
index 
. 
5) 
were 
overweight 
and 
59% 
had 
MetS, 
16% 
of 
children 
without 
SDB 
had 
MetS. 
Twenty-five 
percent 
of 
those 
with 
MetS 
had 
SDB. 
After 
adjusting 
for 
age, 
race, 
sex, 
and 
preterm 
status, 
children 
with 
SDB 
had 
a 
6.49 
(95% 
confidence 
interval, 
2.52, 
16.70) 
increased 
odds 
of 
MetS 
compared 
with 
children 
without 
SDB. 
Indices 
of 
SDB 
stress 
associated 
with 
MetS 
included 
respiratory 
event 
frequency, 
degree 
of 
oxygen 
desaturation, 
and 
sleep 
efficiency. 
Analyses 
of 
individual 
metabolic 
parameters 
showed 
that, 
after 
adjustment 
for 
body 
mass 
index, 
SDB 
was 
associated 
with 
systolic 
and 
diastolic 
blood 
pressure, 
low-density 
lipoprotein 
cholesterol, 
and 
fasting 
insulin 
levels. 
Conclusions: 
A 
majority 
of 
adolescents 
with 
SDB 
are 
overweight 
and 
meet 
criteria 
for 
MetS. 
The 
close 
association 
between 
MetS 
and 
SDB 
and 
their 
putative 
interacting 
pathophysiologies 
suggests 
a 
need 
to 
develop 
screening, 
prevention, 
and 
treatment 
strategies 
for 
both 
disorders 
in 
high-risk, 
overweight 
adolescents.

Metabolic 
syndrome 
(MetS) 
refers 
to 
a 
clustering 
of 
abnormalities 
in 
glucose 
and 
lipid 
metabolism, 
believed 
to 
result 
from 
insulin 
resistance 
and/or 
central 
obesity. 
MetS, 
defined 
according 
to 
criteria 
established 
by 
the 
Adult 
Treatment 
Panel 
III 
(ATP 
III), 
is 
estimated 
to 
affect 
more 
than 
20% 
of 
United 
States’ 
adults, 
who 
frequently 
progress 
to 
diabetes 
and 
are 
at 
increased 
risk 
for 
premature 
cardiovascular 
disease 
(1). 
Approximately 
95% 
of 
adults 
with 
MetS 
are 
overweight 
or 
obese 
(2). 


MetS 
is 
also 
estimated 
to 
afflict 
4 
to 
10% 
of 
adolescents 
(3, 
4). 
Similar 
to 
adults, 
overweight 
children 
have 
greater 
degrees 
of 
metabolic 
dysfunction 
than 
normal-weight 
children, 
and 
such 
abnormalities 
appear 
to 
track 
over 
time 
and 
predict 
metabolic 
dysfunction 
and 
cardiovascular 
risk 
profiles 
in 
adulthood 
(5, 
6).

A

COMMENTARY 


Scientific 
Knowledge 
on 
the 
Subject 


Sleep 
apnea 
has 
been 
associated 
with 
diabetes 
and 
glucose 
impairment 
in 
adults. 
It 
has 
not 
yet 
been 
established 
whether 
sleep 
apnea 
is 
also 
associated 
with 
metabolic 
syndrome 
in 
children. 


What 
This 
Study 
Adds 
to 
the 
Field 


Obesity 
and 
metabolic 
syndrome 
are 
prevalent 
in 
adolescents 
with 
modest 
sleep 
apnea. 
Associations 
of 
metabolic 
dysfunction 
with 
sleep 
apnea 
persisted 
after 
considering 
weight, 
suggesting 
that 
sleep 
apnea 
contributes 
to 
metabolic 
dysfunction 
in 
children. 


The 
rising 
prevalence 
of 
overweight 
among 
children 
and 
adolescents 
has 
been 
implicated 
in 
the 
10-fold 
estimated 
increased 
rate 
of 
noninsulin 
diabetes 
in 
adolescents, 
and 
has 
raised 
concerns 
over 
long-term 
cardiovascular 
health 
sequelae 
in 
the 
population 
(7, 
8). 
In 
addition 
to 
increased 
weight 
and 
waist 
circumference, 
childhood 
risk 
factors 
for 
MetS 
include 
male 
sex 
and 
Mexican-
American 
ethnicity 
(4). 


Sleep-disordered 
breathing 
(SDB), 
characterized 
by 
loud 
snoring, 
sleep 
fragmentation, 
and 
sleep-associated 
intermittent 
hypoxemia, 
occurs 
in 
more 
than 
4% 
of 
adults 
(9) 
and 
1 
to 
6% 
of 
children 
(10). 
Recent 
cross-sectional 
and 
longitudinal 
data 
have 
shown 
strong 
and 
consistent 
associations 
between 
indices 
of 
SDB 
with 
glucose 
impairment 
and/or 
diabetes 
in 
adults 
(11, 
12). 
Causal 
relationships 
are 
supported 
by 
data 
showing 
that 
treatment 
of 
SDB 
is 
associated 
with 
improvement 
in 
indices 
of 
glucose 
impairment 
(13) 
or 
diabetes 
control 
(14). 
However, 
research 
that 
addresses 
the 
role 
of 
SDB 
as 
a 
risk 
factor 
for 
MetS 
in 
children 
is 
more 
limited. 
The 
few 
available 
reports 
have 
provided 
conflicting 
data, 
and 
have 
been 
restricted 
to 
reports 
of 
children 
referred 
for 
evaluation 
at 
a 
sleep 
clinic 
where 
various 
referral 
biases 
may 
operate. 


In 
this 
report, 
we 
quantified 
the 
association 
between 
MetS 
and 
SDB 
in 
a 
community-based 
cohort 
of 
adolescents 
who 
had 
undergone 
standardized 
assessments 
of 
SDB 
and 
measurement 
of 
key 
components 
of 
MetS. 
We 
addressed 
the 
hypothesis 
that 
MetS 
is 
more 
prevalent 
among 
adolescents 
with 
SDB 
than 
in 
those 
without 
SDB. 
In 
addition, 
we 
evaluated 
whether 
the 
association 
between 
MetS 
and 
SDB 
is 
independent 
of 
socioeconomic 
class, 
race, 
and 
sex, 
and 
addressed 
whether 
MetS 
is 
associated 
with 
specific 
components 
of 
SDB, 
including 
indices 
of 
overnight 
hypoxemia, 
sleep 
fragmentation, 
or 
insufficient 
sleep. 
Finally, 
we 
explored 
whether 
individual 
measures 
of 
metabolic 
dysfunction 
were 
associated 
with 
SDB 
independently 
of 
body 
mass 
index 
(BMI).

METHODS 


Study 
Population 


The 
study 
sample 
was 
derived 
from 
an 
ongoing 
longitudinal 
cohort 
study, 
the 
Cleveland 
Children’s 
Sleep 
and 
Health 
Study 
(CCSHS). 
The 
CCSHS 
is 
an 
urban, 
community-based 
cohort 
of 
907 
children 
recruited 
between 
1998 
and 
2002 
to 
participate 
in 
a 
study 
of 
sleep 
and 
health 
in 
children. 
Children 
were 
recruited 
from 
the 
1988 
and 
1993 
birth 
rosters 
of 
three 
area 
hospitals; 
sampling 
was 
designed 
to 
overrepresent 
preterm 
and 
African-American 
children 
and 
included 
644 
children 
who 
had 
participated 
in 
the 
Low 
Birthweight–Maternal 
Employment 
Study 
at 
ages 
4 
to 
6 
years, 
as 
described 
previously 
(10). 
The 
first 
CCSHS 
examination, 
conducted 
when 
children 
were 
8 
to 
11 
years 
old, 
included 
in-
home 
assessment 
of 
sleep 
patterns, 
SDB, 
blood 
pressure, 
anthropometry, 
and 
neuropsychological 
function. 
A 
second 
exam 
was 
conducted 
in 
2002–2006, 
when 
the 
children 
were 
13 
to 
16 
years 
of 
age. 
This 
examination 
included 
an 
overnight 
stay 
in 
a 
general 
clinical 
research 
center 
and 
assessment 
of 
sleep, 
anthropometric, 
blood 
pressure, 
and 
metabolic 
parameters. 
Recruitment 
for 
this 
second 
examination 
aimed 
to 
enroll 
at 
least 
250 
CCSHS 
participants, 
targeting 
all 
snorers 
and 
SDB 
cases 
identified 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
first 
CCSHS 
examination, 
and 
a 
stratified 
(sex, 
race, 
term) 
random 
sample 
of 
the 
remaining 
cohort 
(n 
. 
389). 
Of 
those 
389, 
75.1% 
(n 
. 
292) 
agreed 
to 
participate, 
14.9% 
refused, 
10.0% 
could 
not 
be 
located, 
and 
less 
than 
1% 
were 
ineligible 
due 
to 
severe 
illnesses 
(e.g., 
renal 
failure, 
cancer). 
Of 
the 
families 
who 
refused 
to 
participate, 
the 
most 
common 
reasons 
were 
as 
follows: 
passive 
refusal 
(e.g., 
agreed 
to 
participate 
but 
did 
not 
make 
appointments) 
(17.2%), 
too 
busy 
(19.0%), 
reluctance 
to 
participant 
in 
hospital-
based 
tests 
(13.8%), 
and 
miscellaneous 
reasons 
(50.0%). 
A 
comparison 
of 
participants 
to 
nonparticipants 
targeted 
for 
this 
exam 
revealed 
no 
significant 
differences 
in 
the 
age, 
race, 
sex, 
preterm 
status, 
maternal 
educational 
level, 
or 
sleep 
characteristics 
(apnea–hypopnea 
index 
[AHI], 
average 
and 
minimal 
saturation) 
measured 
at 
the 
first 
CCSHS 
visit. 
Exclusion 
of 
two 
children 
with 
known 
diabetes 
and 
20 
children 
with 
incomplete 
data 
yielded 
an 
analytic 
sample 
of 
270 
participants. 


Study 
Protocol 


As 
part 
of 
a 
standardized 
research 
protocol, 
each 
child 
was 
studied 
in 
a 
dedicated 
clinical 
research 
facility 
at 
a 
time 
when 
free 
of 
acute 
illness, 
and 
underwent 
overnight 
polysomnography, 
venipuncture 
both 
before 
(at 
10:00 
p.m.) 
and 
after 
sleep 
and 
overnight 
fasting 
(7:00 
a.m.), 
an 
oral 
glucose 
tolerance 
test 
(oral 
administration 
of 
75 
g 
of 
anhydrous 
glucose 
and 
venipuncture 
after 
2 
h), 
and 
physiological 
and 
anthropometric 
assessments. 
Informed 
consent 
was 
obtained 
from 
the 
child’s 
parent 
or 
legal 
guardian 
and 
written 
assent 
from 
the 
child. 
The 
study 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
governing 
institutional 
review 
board. 


Measurements 


Height 
was 
measured 
using 
a 
rigid 
stadiometer, 
and 
weight 
with 
a 
calibrated 
digital 
scale. 
BMI 
was 
calculated 
by 
dividing 
the 
weight 
in 
kilograms 
by 
height 
in 
meters 
squared 
and 
converted 
into 
age-and 
sex-adjusted 
percentiles 
based 
on 
population 
data 
from 
NHANES 
(National 
Health 
and 
Nutrition 
Examination 
Survey) 
2000 
(15). 
The 
minimal 
waist 
circumference 
was 
measured 
by 
trained 
research 
staff 
in 
duplicate 
and 
averaged. 
Three 
blood 
pressure 
readings 
at 
each 
of 
three 
measurement 
times 
(10:00 
p.m., 
7:00 
a.m., 
and 
1:00 
p.m.) 
were 
obtained 
following 
standardized 
guidelines 
using 
a 
calibrated 
sphygmomanometer 
(16). 
Information 
on 
health 
habits 
and 
demographic 
variables 
was 
obtained 
from 
a 
standardized 
questionnaire 
(17). 
Indices 
of 
socioeconomic 
status 
included 
parent 
report 
of 
family 
income 
and 
educational 
level 
as 
well 
as 
median 
income 
of 
the 
census 
tract 
of 
residence 
of 
the 
family 
at 
the 
time 
of 
enrollment 
in 
the 
CCSHS. 
The 
latter 
was 
derived 
by 
matching 
each 
child’s 
address 
to 
the 
corresponding 
2000 
U.S. 
Census 
Bureau 
tract 
database 
(18). 
Measures 
of 
sleep 
duration 
were 
based 
on 
a 
5-to 
7-day 
sleep 
diary 
(75.5% 
of 
the 
sample 
had 
sleep 
diary 
data 
available 
for 
all 
7 
d), 
requesting 
the 
participant 
to 
record 
on 
a 
daily 
basis 
bed 
time, 
wake 
time, 
and 
approximate 
time 
to 
fall 
asleep 
(19). 
Pubertal 
status 
was 
ascertained 
by 
Tanner 
staging 
(20, 
21) 
performed 
by 
a 
physician. 
Preterm 
status 
was 
defined 
gestational 
age 
of 
less 
than 
36 
weeks. 
For 
full-term 
children, 
birth 
weight 
was 
obtained 
by 
parent 
report, 
and 
for 
preterm 
children, 
by 
extraction 
from 
the 
neonatal 
birth 
record. 


Glucose 
and 
fasting 
lipids 
were 
measured 
by 
enzymatic 
methods 
under 
Centers 
for 
Disease 
Control 
and 
Prevention 
guidelines 
(22). 
Insulin 
was 
measured 
by 
radioimmunoassay. 
The 
homeostatic 
model 
assessment 
(HOMA) 
was 
calculated 
as 
a 
product 
of 
fasting 
insulin 
and 
glucose 
(23). 


The 
polysomnography 
recording 
(Compumedics 
E-series; 
Compumedics, 
Abbotsford, 
Australia) 
consisted 
of 
the 
following: 
two 
electroencephalograms 
(C3/C2 
and 
C4/C1), 
bilateral 
electrooculograms, 
a 
bipolar 
submental 
electromyogram, 
thoracic 
and 
abdominal 
respiratory 
inductance 
plethysmography 
(Compumedics 
Summit 
IP), 
airflow 
(by 
a 
Protec 
nasal–oral 
thermocouple 
[Protec, 
Wordsville, 
WA] 
and 
nasal 
pressure 
recording), 
finger 
pulse 
oximetry 
(Nonin 
model 
320 
pulse 
oximeter 
[Nonin 
Medical, 
Plymouth, 
MA] 
with 
displayed 
waveform), 
electrocardiogram, 
body 
position, 
and 
monitoring 
bilateral 
leg 
movements 
by 
piezoelectric 
sensors. 
Studies 
were 
scored 
by 
certified 
research 
technologists 
(24). 
Obstructive 
apneas 
were 
scored 
when 
there 
was 
a 
complete 
or 
nearly 
complete 
absence 
of 
airflow 
on 
the 
thermistry 
channel 
for 
8 
seconds 
or 
more 
and 
the 
duration 
of 
two 
breaths, 
in 
association 
with 
respiratory 
effort. 
Hypopneas 
were 
identified 
as 
a 
clear 
(. 
30%) 
decline 
in 
airflow 
(from 
the 
thermocouple 
or 
nasal 
pressure 
signals) 
or 
respiratory 
effort 
(from 
inductive 
respiratory 
bands) 
for 
8 
seconds 
or 
more 
associated 
with 
an 
oxygen 
desaturation 
of 
3% 
or 
more. 
Sleep 
staging 
and 
arousals 
were 
based 
on 
standard 
criteria 
(25, 
26). 
The 
AHI 
was 
calculated 
as 
the 
average 
number 
of 
obstructive 
apneas 
and 
hypopneas 
per 
hour 
of 
sleep. 
Our 
primary 
exposure 
variable 
was 
SDB, 
based 
on 
an 
AHI 
of 
5 
or 
greater, 
a 
value 
associated 
with 
mild 
SDB 
in 
adult 
studies, 
and 
one 
we 
considered 
to 
conservatively 
identify 
this 
disorder 
in 
adolescents. 
Levels 
above 
an 
AHI 
threshold 
of 
5 
have 
been 
found 
to 
be 
associated 
with 
elevated 
C-reactive 
protein 
levels 
in 
adolescents 
(27). 
However, 
secondary 
analyses 
examined 
a 
lower 
AHI 
threshold 
(. 
1), 
as 
well 
as 
examined 
as 
continuous 
variables 
the 
AHI, 
and 
measures 
of 
sleep 
hypoxemia 
(average 
and 
nadir 
levels 
of 
oxygen 
saturation 
during 
sleep 
and 
oxygen 
saturation 
. 
90%), 
percentage 
of 
time 
in 
slow-wave 
sleep, 
sleep 
efficiency 
(percentage 
of 
the 
sleep 
period 
spent 
asleep), 
and 
the 
arousal 
index 
(number 
of 
cortical 
arousals 
per 
hour 
of 
sleep). 


Definition 
of 
MetS 


Our 
primary 
definition 
of 
MetS 
was 
based 
on 
criteria 
outlined 
in 
a 
report 
by 
de 
Ferranti 
and 
colleagues, 
who 
adapted 
ATP 
III 
adult 
criteria 
for 
a 
pediatric 
population 
(4). 
Adolescents 
who 
met 
at 
least 
three 
of 
the 
following 
five 
criteria 
were 
classified 
as 
having 
MetS: 
(1) 
waist 
circumference 
greater 
than 
the 
75th 
percentile 
for 
age 
and 
sex 
(28); 
(2)mean 
systolic 
or 
diastolic 
blood 
pressure 
greater 
than 
the 
90th 
percentile 
for 
age, 
sex, 
and 
height 
(29) 
or 
current 
blood 
pressure 
medication 
use 
(n 
. 
3); 


(3 
) 
triglyceride 
levels 
of 
97.35 
mg/dl 
or 
greater; 
(4)low 
high-density 
lipoprotein 
(HDL) 
(for 
boys 
aged 
15–17, 
HDL 
. 
45.17 
mg/dl; 
all 
others, 
HDL 
. 
50.19 
mg/dl); 
(5 
) 
fasting 
glucose 
of 
100 
mg/dl 
or 
greater 
(30), 
or 
an 
oral 
glucose 
tolerance 
test 
result 
of 
140 
or 
more. 
Secondary 
analyses 
used 
the 
criteria 
proposed 
by 
Cook 
and 
colleagues 
(3), 
which 
differed 
from 
de 
Ferranti 
as 
follows: 
central 
obesity 
(waist 
circumference 
. 
90th 
percentile 
for 
age 
and 
sex) 
(28), 
elevated 
triglyceride 
(triglyceride 
. 
110 
mg/dl), 
and 
low 
HDL 
(HDL 
. 
40 
mg/dl). 
Statistical 
Analysis 


Bivariate 
comparisons 
were 
evaluated 
using 
the 
two-sample 
t 
test, 
the 
Wilcoxon 
rank 
sum 
test, 
and 
the 
Pearson 
2 
test 
for 
normally 
distributed, 
skewed, 
and 
categorical 
data, 
respectively. 
Logistic 
regression 
was 
used 
to 
assess 
the 
relationship 
between 
SDB 
(AHI 
. 
5) 
and 
MetS. 
Models 
were 
fit 
without 
covariate 
adjustment 
as 
well 
as 
adjusted 
for 
age, 
sex, 
and 
race, 
covariates 
associated 
with 
MetS 
in 
prior 
work 
(4). 
Although 
preliminary 
analyses 
showed 
no 
association 
between 
preterm 
history 
and 
MetS, 
models 
were 
also 
adjusted 
for 
preterm 
status 
as 
a 
design 
variable, 
because 
this 
covariate 
had 
been 
used 
in 
constructing 
the 
sample. 
Secondary 
analyses 
assessed 
the 
associations 
of 
alternative 
polysomnographic 
measures 
with 
MetS, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
association 
between 
individual 
measures 
of 
metabolic 
dysfunction 
with 
SDB 
status 
adjusted 
for 
BMI 
percentile. 
The 
results 
are 
summarized 
using 
odds 
ratios 
(ORs) 
and 
95% 
confidence 
intervals 
(95% 
CIs). 
Analyses 
were 
performed 
using 
SAS 
version 
9.1.3 
(SAS 
Institute, 
Inc., 
Cary, 
NC).

RESULTS 


The 
sample 
comprised 
children 
with 
a 
mean 
age 
of 
13.7 
(. 
0.7) 
years, 
with 
approximately 
equal 
proportions 
of 
African 
Americans 
and 
European 
Americans, 
and 
of 
males 
and 
females 
(Table 
1). 
Approximately 
25% 
of 
the 
sample 
was 
overweight 
and 
19% 
met 
criteria 
for 
MetS. 
A 
greater 
proportion 
of 
adolescents 
with 
MetS 
compared 
with 
unaffected 
children 
was 
male 
and 
overweight. 
No 
significant 
group 
(MetS 
vs. 
no 
MetS) 
differences 
were 
observed 
with 
respect 
to 
age, 
preterm 
history, 
race, 
Tanner 
stage, 
or 
any 
index 
of 
socioeconomic 
status 
(Table 
1). 


Table 
1 
also 
shows 
the 
distribution 
of 
sleep 
characteristics 
of 
adolescents 
with 
and 
without 
MetS. 
SDB 
(AHI 
. 
5) 
was 
observed 
in 
25% 
of 
children 
with 
MetS, 
but 
only 
in 
4% 
of 
adolescents 
without 
MetS 
(p 
. 
0.001). 
Compared 
with 
children 
without 
MetS, 
those 
with 
MetS 
had 
more 
severe 
nocturnal 
desaturation 
and 
poorer 
sleep 
efficiency, 
but 
do 
not 
differ 
in 
their 
arousal 
index, 
percentage 
time 
in 
slow-wave 
sleep, 
average 
sleep 
time 
on 
weekdays, 
or 
habitual 
snoring. 
Although 
weekend 
sleep 
duration 


was 
reported 
to 
be 
less 
in 
those 
with 
MetS, 
the 
difference 
between 
weekend 
and 
weekday 
sleep, 
a 
measure 
used 
to 
approximate 
“sleep 
debt,” 
was 
not 
different 
between 
groups. 


Figure 
1 
further 
demonstrates 
that, 
as 
AHI 
severity 
category 
increases, 
there 
was 
a 
progressive 
increase 
in 
the 
proportion 
of 
children 
classified 
with 
MetS 
(p 
. 
0.001). 


To 
further 
understand 
the 
association 
between 
SDB 
and 
MetS, 
we 
compared 
the 
distribution 
of 
subject 
characteristics 
in 
adolescents 
with 
and 
without 
SDB 
(Table 
1, 
right 
columns). 
Both 
overweight 
and 
MetS 
were 
more 
prevalent 
in 
the 
SDB 
compared 
with 
the 
non-SDB 
group. 
Overweight 
and 
MetS, 
respectively, 
were 
observed 
in 
73 
and 
59% 
of 
children 
with 
SDB, 
compared 
with 
21 
and 
16% 
of 
children 
without 
SDB 
(. 
0.001). 
A 
greater 
proportion 
of 
adolescents 
with 
SDB 
was 
male. 
However, 
age, 
race, 
preterm 
status, 
and 
indices 
of 
socioeconomic 
status 
did 
not 
vary 
by 
SDB. 
Self-reported 
sleep 
duration 
on 
weekdays 
was 
almost 
identical 
in 
the 
SDB 
and 
non-SDB 
groups 
(8.67 
. 
1.06 
vs. 


8.67 
.

for 
non-SDB 
and

respectively),

(Table

Adjusting 
for 
sex, 
age, 
race, 
and 
preterm 
status 
did 
not 
appreciably 
alter 
the 
magnitude 
of 
this 
association 
(adjusted 
OR, 
6.49; 
95% 
CI, 
2.52, 
16.70). 
When 
redefining 
MetS 
using 
similar 
criteria 
as 
Cook 
and 
colleagues 
(3), 
the 
adjusted 
odds 
for 
SDB 
was 
even 
higher, 
9.02 
(95% 
CI, 
3.17, 
25.66). 
Secondary 
analyses 
conducted 
on 
the 
entire 
sample, 
substituting 
alternative 
measures 
of 
SDB 
severity, 
showed 
that 
the 
odds 
of 
MetS 
varied 
with 
level 
of 
overnight 
desaturation, 
sleep 
efficiency, 
and 
AHI 
as 
a 
continuous 
variable 
(Table 
3). 
Although 
slow-wave 
sleep 
was 
marginally 
associated 
with 
MetS, 
no 
significant 
association 
was 
observed 
with 
the 
arousal 
index. 
Finally, 
we 
explored 
the 
relationship 
between 
SDB, 
defined 
using 
a 
lower 
threshold 
value 
of 
AHI 
(. 
1) 
and 
MetS. 
This 
definition 
classified 
82 
children 
with 
SDB.

even

low

AHI

was 
significant, 
3.54 
(95% 
CI, 
1.83, 
6.84). 


Additional 
exploratory 
analyses 
were 
conducted 
to 
ascertain 
the 
pattern 
of 
metabolic 
dysfunction 
in 
this 
sample 
and 
to 
identify 
differences 
in 
metabolic 
parameters 
between 
the 
SDB 
and 
non-SDB 
group, 
and 
to 
explore 
which 
metabolic 
parameters 
were 
associated 
with 
SDB 
independently 
of 
BMI 
(percentile) 
(Table 
4). 
Because 
precise 
cutoffs 
for 
abnormality 
were 
not 
needed 
for 
these 
analyses, 
we 
assessed 
the 
variation 
among 
continuous 
indices 
of 
blood 
pressure, 
lipid 
and 
glucose 
levels, 
and 
insulin 
indices. 
These 
results 
showed 
that 
even 
after 
adjusting 
for 
BMI 
percentile, 
the 
SDB 
group 
was 
observed 
to 
have 
significantly 
higher 
levels 
of 
systolic 
and 
diastolic 
blood 
pressure, 
fasting 
insulin 
and 
HOMA 
levels, 
and 
low-density 
lipoprotein 
cholesterol.

adolescents 
to 
range 
from 
4 
to 
10% 
(3, 
4), 
with 
differences 
attributable 
to 
variations 
in 
the 
definitions 
of 
MetS 
used 
in 
each 
study. 
These 
analyses, 
as 
well 
as 
those 
of 
clinic-based 
samples, 
indicate 
that 
MetS 
occurs 
in 
approximately 
25 
to 
30% 
of 
overweight 
children, 
and 
in 
as 
many 
as 
50% 
of 
severely 
obese 
children 
(31, 
32). 
Although 
prevalence 
of 
individual 
components 
of 
MetS 
vary 
among 
subgroups 
of 
children, 
MetS 
appears 
to 
be 
slightly 
more 
common 
in 
boys, 
and 
especially 
prevalent 
in 
Mexican 
Americans 
(4). 
Our 
data 
for 
the 
first 
time 
address 
SDB 
as 
a 
risk 
factor 
for 
MetS 
in 
a 
community 
sample 
of 
adolescents 
and 
demonstrate 
that 
adolescents 
with 
SDB 
are 
at 
an 
approximately 
sevenfold 
increased 
odds 
of 
MetS 
than 
unaffected 
children 
(found 
in 
almost 
60% 
of 
our 
sample 
with 
SDB), 
and 
this 
association 
is 
not 
explained 
by 
sex, 
race, 
or 
socioeconomic 
status. 
Furthermore, 
secondary 
analyses 
suggested 
that, 
even 
after 
adjusting 
for 
sex 
and 
BMI 
percentile, 
adolescents 
with 
SDB 
have 
elevated 
levels 
of 
blood 
pressure, 
insulin, 
and 
low-density 
lipoprotein 
cholesterol 
(i.e., 
indices 
associated 
with 
MetS). 


SDB 
is 
increasingly 
recognized 
as 
contributing 
to 
a 
substantive 
public 
health 
burden 
in 
both 
adults 
and 
children. 
In 
adults, 
even 
after 
adjusting 
for 
the 
effects 
of 
obesity, 
SDB 
has 
been 
associated 
with 
a 
40 
to 
200% 
increased 
odds 
of 
cardiovascular 
disease 
and 
glucose 
intolerance 
(12, 
33, 
34). 
In 
the 
Sleep 
Heart 
Health 
Study, 
increasing 
sleep 
apnea 
severity, 
as 
measured 
by 


the 
AHI 
or 
nocturnal 
oxygen 
saturation 
levels, 
was 
associated 
with 
glycemic 
status 
(12). 
Relative 
to 
individuals 
with 
an 
AHI 
of 
less 
than 
5.0, 
glucose 
intolerance 
was 
30 
to 
50% 
more 
prevalent 
in 
those 
with 
mild 
and 
moderate 
SDB, 
respectively 
(12). 
Longitudinal 
data 
also 
indicate 
that 
individuals 
with 
SDB 
are 
at 
increased 
risk 
for 
incident 
diabetes 
(11, 
35). 
In 
a 
10-year 
prospective 
evaluation 
performed 
in 
the 
Nurses’ 
Health 
Study, 
habitual 
snorers 
had 
an 
age-and 
BMI-adjusted 
relative 
risk 
for 
diabetes 
of 
2.3 
(11). 
A 
study 
in 
adult 
patients 
with 
SDB 
showed 
an 
improvement 
of 
insulin 
resistance 
by 
32% 
after 
sleep 
apnea 
treatment 
(13). 


Relatively 
little 
research 
has 
addressed 
the 
association 
of 
metabolic 
dysfunction 
with 
SDB 
in 
children, 
and 
no 
study 
has 
yet 
explicitly 
studied 
MetS 
in 
relationship 
to 
childhood 
SDB. 
An 
early 
Australian 
study 
of 
obese 
snoring 
children 
referred 
to 
a 
sleep 
laboratory 
reported 
a 
significant 
association 
between 
fasting 
insulin 
levels 
and 
the 
AHI, 
arousal 
index, 
and 
desaturation 
time 
that 
appeared 
to 
be 
unrelated 
to 
BMI 
(36). 
However, 
an 
uncontrolled 
follow-up 
study 
from 
this 
group 
failed 
to 
confirm 
an 
independent 
association 
between 
SDB 
and 
fasting 
insulin 
levels, 
nor 
did 
it 
show 
consistent 
associations 
between 
treatment 
of 
SDB 
and 
improvement 
in 
metabolic 
indices 
(37). 
Two 
other 
reports 
from 
pediatric 
sleep 
laboratories 
of 
young, 
prepubertal 
children, 
including 
one 
study 
that 
excluded 
obese 
children 
(38), 
also 
did 
not 
show 
significant 
associations 
between 
fasting 
insulin 
levels 
and 
indices 
of 
SDB 
(38, 
39). 
In 
contrast, 
in 
our 
community-
based 
sample 
of 
predominantly 
postpubertal 
adolescents, 
we 
have 
demonstrated 
strong 
associations 
of 
SDB 
with 
MetS 
as 
well 
as 
with 
individual 
metabolic 
parameters 
commonly 
associated 
with 
MetS, 
including 
fasting 
insulin 
and 
the 
HOMA 
index. 
A 
longitudinal 
study 
of 
children 
has 
demonstrated 
that 
many 
components 
of 
the 
MetS 
become 
more 
prevalent 
between 
the 
ages 
of 
10 
and 
19 
years 
(40). 
Thus, 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
study 
differences 
reflect 
a 
potential 
age 
dependency 
of 
the 
expression 
of 
MetS. 
Stronger 
findings 
in 
adolescents 
could 
be 
due 
to 
effects 
associated 
with 
the 
chronicity 
of 
SDB, 
modifying 
influences 
related 
to 
puberty 
or 
other 
age-related 
changes 
in 
metabolism, 
or 
to 
differences 
in 
the 
pathogenesis 
of 
SDB 
in 
younger 
compared 
with 
older 
children 
(including 
a 
possibly 
stronger 
influence 
of 
obesity 
on 
SDB 
pathogenesis 
in 
adolescents 
compared 
with 
younger 
children).

CCSHS 
cohort 
showed 
a 
modest 
and 
nonsignificant 
association 
between 
BMI 
and 
SDB 
in 
children 
aged 
8 
to 
11 
years 
(10), 
in 
the 
subgroup 
followed 
at 
ages 
13 
to 
16 
years, 
a 
stronger 
association 
between 
obesity 
and 
SDB 
was 
observed. 
Because 
an 
analysis 
by 
Tauman 
and 
colleagues, 
restricted 
to 
obese 
children, 
failed 
to 
demonstrate 
an 
association 
between 
indices 
of 
glucose 
homeostasis 
and 
SDB 
(39), 
study 
differences 
are 
unlikely 
to 
be 
due 
solely 
to 
differences 
in 
obesity 
prevalence 
in 
the 
study 
populations. 


In 
children, 
standardized 
definitions 
of 
MetS 
do 
not 
yet 
exist. 
We 
chose 
as 
our 
primary 
definition 
one 
that 
was 
adapted 
from 
the 
ATP 
III 
recommendations 
(4) 
and 
repeated 
our 
analyses 
using 
a 
more 
conservative 
definition 
(3). 
Although 
the 
prevalence 
of 
MetS 
was 
lower 
using 
the 
latter 
definition, 
the 
overall 
magnitude 
of 
associations 
between 
SDB 
and 
MetS 
was 
similar. 


In 
adults, 
MetS 
is 
most 
commonly 
defined 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
a 
clustering 
of 
abnormalities 
in 
blood 
pressure, 
glucose–insulin 
homeostasis, 
lipids, 
and/or 
evidence 
of 
central 
obesity. 
A 
pivotal 
role 
for 
central 
obesity 
in 
this 
syndrome 
is 
supported 
by 
data 
showing 
an 
increased 
incidence 
of 
MetS 
in 
children 
with 
persistent 
elevations 
in 
waist 
circumference 
during 
childhood 
(40), 
as 
well 
as 
other 
data 
showing 
strong 
correlations 
between 
indices 
of 
obesity 
and 
other 
components 
of 
the 
MetS 
(5). 
This 
appears 
to 
be 
due 
to 
a 
role 
of 
adipose 
tissue 
in 
mediating 
cytokine, 
growth 
factor, 
and 
sex 
steroid 
levels, 
which 
interactively 
may 
modify 
the 
actions 
and 
secretion 
of 
insulin 
and 
the 
metabolism 
of 
fatty 
acids 
(41). 
Thus, 
epidemiologic 
studies 
of 
MetS 
do 
not 
usually 
attempt 
to 
separate 
out 
the 
influence 
of 
obesity, 
which 
is 
integral 
to 
the 
syndrome. 
Accordingly, 
our 
primary 
analyses 
quantified 
the 
association 
between 
MetS 
and 
SDB, 
acknowledging 
that 
central 
obesity 
is 
an 
integral 
component 
of 
MetS. 


Among 
adolescents, 
the 
prevalence 
of 
obesity 
has 
tripled 
from 
5 
to 
15% 
over 
the 
last 
30 
years, 
with 
an 
additional 
30% 
of 
adolescents 
currently 
considered 
overweight 
(42). 
Childhood 
obesity 
is 
associated 
with 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
pediatric 
health 
effects, 
including 
insulin 
resistance 
and 
childhood 
diabetes 
(43, 
44), 
hypertension, 
and 
psychosocial 
morbidity, 
and 
also 
predicts 
the 
development 
of 
chronic 
health 
conditions 
in 
adulthood 
(45, 
46). 
Obesity 
is 
also 
a 
strong 
risk 
factor 
for 
adult 
SDB. 
Although 
data 
in 
children 
are 
more 
equivocal, 
obesity 
has 
been 
reported 
to 
be 
a 
risk 
factor 
for 
snoring 
or 
SDB 
in 
samples 
of 
older 
children 
and 
adolescents 
(47, 
48). 
Our 
data 
are 
consistent 
with 
this 
and 
underscore 
the 
importance 
of 
overweight 
as 
an 
SDB 
risk 
factor 
in 
adolescents: 
72% 
of 
children 
with 
SDB 
in 
our 
sample 
were 
overweight 
and 
77% 
had 
an 
increased 
waist 
circumference. 


The 
cross-sectional 
study 
design 
and 
high 
prevalence 
of 
obesity 
in 
the 
SDB 
group 
prevent 
precise 
assessment 
of 
the 
causal 
role 
of 
SDB 
in 
the 
pathogenesis 
of 
MetS. 
The 
biological 
plausibility 
of 
SDB 
as 
a 
contributor 
to 
the 
pathogenesis 
of 
MetS 
is 
supported 
by 
data 
from 
adult 
studies 
showing 
that 
SDB-associated 
sympathetic 
activation 
and 
hypoxemia 
may 
lead 
to 
the 
generation 
of 
reactive 
oxygen 
species, 
stimulation 
of 
various 
inflammatory 
cytokines, 
and 
endothelial 
dysfunction 
(49–51). 
Such 
effects 
appear 
to 
be 
relevant 
to 
pediatric 
patients 
with 
SDB 
as 
well, 
as 
evidenced 
by 
studies 
showing 
elevations 
in 
inflammatory 
mediators 
in 
children 
with 
SDB 
(27, 
52, 
53). 
To 
explore 
the 
potential 
impact 
of 
SDB 
that 
may 
be 
secondary 
to 
effects 
of 
obesity 
and 
directly 
related 
to 
SDB 
stresses, 
we 
performed 
a 
series 
of 
secondary 
analyses. 
These 
suggested 
that 
individual 
parameters 
associated 
with 
MetS, 
such 
as 
levels 
of 
blood 
pressure 
and 
fasting 
insulin 
and 
HOMA, 
vary 
with 
SDB 
status 
independently 
of 
sex 
and 
BMI 
percentile. 
Furthermore, 
we 
showed 
that 
MetS 
was 
strongly 
associated 
with 
indices 
of 
sleep-related 
oxygen 
desaturation 
and 
low 
sleep 
efficiency, 
but 
not 
arousal 
frequency. 
Use 
of 
a 
more 
liberal 
criterion 
of 
SDB 
(AHI 
. 
1) 
was 
associated 
with 
a 
weaker 
association 
with 
MetS 
than 
a 
higher 
threshold 
value, 
and 
snoring 
history 
was 
not 
associated 
with 
MetS. 
Studies 


in 
adults 
also 
have 
shown 
that, 
of 
the 
conventionally 
measured 
indices 
of 
SDB, 
measures 
of 
hypoxic 
stress 
were 
the 
strongest 
correlates 
of 
glucose 
intolerance 
and 
insulin 
resistance 
(12, 
54). 
In 
aggregate, 
these 
findings 
point 
to 
SDB, 
possibly 
associated 
with 
hypoxic 
stress, 
as 
a 
contributing 
cause 
of 
MetS 
in 
SDB, 
and 
suggest 
the 
need 
for 
further 
research 
aimed 
both 
at 
elucidating 
the 
potential 
causal 
pathways 
that 
may 
link 
SDB 
and 
metabolic 
dysfunction, 
and 
whether 
treatment 
of 
SDB 
improves 
metabolic 
dysfunction 
in 
adolescents. 
Regardless 
of 
its 
potential 
causal 
role, 
the 
high 
prevalence 
of 
central 
obesity 
and 
MetS 
in 
an 
urban 
community 
sample 
of 
adolescents 
suggests 
the 
importance 
of 
screening 
for 
MetS 
in 
adolescents 
with 
SDB. 


Sleep 
deprivation 
also 
has 
been 
implicated 
as 
a 
risk 
factor 
for 
glucose 
intolerance 
and/or 
diabetes, 
with 
risk 
as 
high 
as 
250% 
for 
those 
getting 
fewer 
than 
5 
hours 
of 
sleep 
(55). 
Effects 
have 
been 
attributed 
to 
sympathetic 
nervous 
system 
overactivity 
as 
well 
as 
hypothalamic 
pituitary–adrenal 
axis 
dysfunction 
occurring 
secondary 
to 
sleep 
deprivation 
(56). 
In 
the 
current 
study, 
average 
sleep 
duration 
on 
weekdays 
did 
not 
significantly 
differ 
in 
children 
with 
or 
without 
SDB, 
or 
with 
or 
without 
MetS. 
Although 
weekend 
sleep 
duration 
was 
less 
in 
children 
with 
MetS, 
it 
is 
unclear 
how 
isolated 
differences 
in 
weekend 
sleep 
duration 
may 
have 
contributed 
to 
the 
study 
findings. 
It 
is 
possible 
that 
the 
prevalence 
of 
severely 
curtailed 
sleep 
duration 
was 
too 
low 
to 
detect 
a 
significant 
relationship 
in 
this 
sample. 


Study 
strengths 
include 
the 
community-based 
sample 
and 
use 
of 
standardized 
assessments 
of 
MetS 
and 
SDB. 
Study 
limitations 
include 
the 
low 
representation 
of 
Hispanics. 
Because 
the 
initial 
cohort 
was 
originally 
designed 
to 
compare 
differences 
in 
health 
outcomes 
between 
full 
and 
preterm 
children, 
our 
sample 
had 
a 
higher 
proportion 
of 
former 
preterm 
children 
than 
in 
the 
general 
population; 
this 
group 
has 
been 
postulated 
to 
be 
at 
increased 
risk 
for 
the 
development 
of 
MetS 
(57). 
However, 
we 
observed 
no 
relationship 
between 
preterm 
status 
or 
birth 
weight 
with 
MetS, 
suggesting 
that 
oversampling 
former 
preterm 
children 
was 
unlikely 
to 
have 
biased 
our 
estimates; 
in 
addition, 
final 
primary 
analyses 
were 
adjusted 
for 
preterm 
status. 
Adjusted 
and 
unadjusted 
ORs 
were 
only 
modestly 
different, 
again 
emphasizing 
that 
age, 
sex, 
race, 
or 
premature 
history 
did 
not 
substantively 
influenced 
the 
associations 
between 
SDB 
and 
MetS. 
Because 
this 
was 
a 
community 
sample, 
the 
number 
of 
children 
with 
moderate 
to 
severe 
SDB 
was 
relatively 
small 
and 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
findings 
may 
differ 
in 
a 
clinical 
sample 
with 
greater 
morbidity. 
Because 
our 
sample 
was 
recruited 
from 
an 
urban 
Midwestern 
city 
and 
had 
a 
higher 
prevalence 
of 
overweight 
than 
reported 
in 
national 
surveys 
(58), 
our 
findings 
may 
be 
less 
generalizable 
to 
other 
samples 
with 
lower 
rates 
of 
obesity. 
Analyses 
were 
cross-sectional 
and, 
because 
the 
definition 
of 
MetS 
includes 
a 
measure 
of 
central 
obesity, 
primary 
analyses 
did 
not 
adjust 
for 
obesity; 
it 
is 
unclear 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
MetS 
was 
independently 
influenced 
by 
the 
obesity 
of 
the 
SDB 
sample, 
as 
compared 
with 
the 
direct 
effects 
of 
overnight 
SDB 
stresses. 
Nonetheless, 
the 
high 
prevalence 
of 
MetS 
in 
the 
SDB 
sample 
was 
even 
greater 
than 
what 
has 
been 
reported 
in 
morbidly 
obese 
children 
(32). 


Conclusions 


These 
results 
underscore 
a 
high 
prevalence 
of 
MetS 
in 
adolescents 
with 
SDB 
and 
the 
potential 
importance 
of 
overnight 
hypoxemia 
as 
a 
central 
mediator 
of 
metabolic 
perturbations. 
The 
aggregation 
of 
MetS, 
overweight, 
and 
SDB 
in 
adolescents 
suggests 
the 
need 
to 
screen 
adolescents 
with 
SDB 
for 
MetS, 
and 
to 
screen 
children 
with 
MetS 
and 
overweight 
for 
SDB. 
The 
high 
prevalence 
of 
central 
obesity 
in 
SDB 
also 
emphasizes 
the 
importance 
of 
weight 
management 
interventions 
in 
groups 
at 
risk 
for 
MetS 
due 
to 
both 
obesity 
and 
to 
SDB-associated 
nocturnal 
stresses. 
The 
association 
between

with

suggests 
that 
SDB 
may 
contribute 
to 
metabolic

over 
and 
beyond

overweight 
alone. 
Because

is 
required 
to 
address 
whether 
treatment 
of 
SDB 
may 
improve 
metabolic 
function 
in 
young 
populations.
