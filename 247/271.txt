OBJECTIVE: 
To 
analyze 
the 
impact 
of 
snoring, 
independent 
of 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
syndrome 
on 
patients 
referred 
for 
home 
sleep 
studies 
and 
to 
report 
a 
new 
technology 
for 
the 
reporting 
of 
snoring, 
using 
sophisticated 
sound 
collection 
and 
noise-canceling 
technology. 
STUDY 
DESIGN 
AND 
SETTING: 
A 
retrospective 
statistical 
review 
of 
consecutive 
anonymous 
data 
compiled 
from 
questionnaires 
and 
digital 
data 
of 
snoring 
loudness 
and 
duration 
measured 
at 
the 
upper 
lip 
during 
unattended 
home 
sleep 
studies 
in 
4,860 
patients 
referred 
for 
snoring 
and 
sleep-disturbed 
breathing. 
RESULTS: 
A 
strong 
relationship 
exists 
between 
a 
history 
of 
snoring 
and 
complaints 
of 
daytime 
sleepiness 
(80%), 
obesity 
(73%), 
and 
chronic 
fatigue 
(78%) 
(all 
yield 
P 
. 
0.001). 
By 
contrast, 
only 
42% 
to 
48% 
of 
patients 
without 
these 
symptoms 
complain 
of 
snoring. 
In 
3 
multiple-regression 
analyses, 
the 
percent 
of 
time 
snoring, 
average 
loudness, 
and 
peak 
loudness 
are 
all 
significantly 
predicted 
by 
the 
apnea 
hypopnea 
index 
(all 
P 
. 
0.003), 
body 
mass 
index 
(all 
P 
. 
0.001), 
and 
age 
(P 
. 
0.014). 
Daytime 
sleepiness 
was 
strongly 
predicted 
by 
percent 
time 
snoring 
(P 
. 
0.014), 
weakly 
by 
average 
loudness 
(P 
. 
0.046), 
and 
not 
at 
all 
by 
peak 
loudness 
(P 
. 
0.303). 
CONCLUSION: 
By 
using 
a 
pair 
of 
microphones 
placed 
at 
the 
upper 
lip, 
one 
that 
samples 
breath 
sounds 
and 
the 
other 
ambient 
sound 
and 
artifact 
noise, 
the 
NovaSOM 
QSG 
measures 
snoring 
while 
canceling 
ambient 
noise. 
The 
clinical 
impact 
of 
snoring 
on 
the 
patient 
as 
well 
as 
the 
bed 
partner, 
independent 
of 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
syndrome, 
is 
an 
unrecognized 
factor 
in 
sleep-disturbed 
breathing. 
SIGNIFICANCE: 
Measurable 
criteria 
to 
define 
snoring 
are 
suggested. 
Snoring 
loudness 
is 
not 
measured 
in 
most 
laboratory 
Polysomnograms.

noring 
is 
caused 
by 
vibration 
of 
soft 
tissues 
of 
the 
upper 
airway, 
which 
in 
turn 
is 
caused 
by 
turbulent 
airflow 
created 
by 
narrowing 
of 
1 
or 
more 
cross-sectional 
areas 
in 
the 
upper 
airway. 
Snoring 
is 
considered 
of 
little 
clinical 
importance 
in 
many 
reports 
in 
the 
sleep 
literature. 
Although 
recognized 
to 
coexist 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
syndrome, 
snoring 
is 
looked 
on 
more 
as 
a 
symptom 
or 
signal 
of 
development 
of 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
syndrome 
sometime 
in 
the 
future. 
At 
the 
present 
time, 
snoring 
loudness 
is 
not 
included 
in 
most 
laboratory 
polysomnograms. 
However, 
a 
minority 
of 
reports 
document 
an 
independent 
impact 
of 
snoring on health.1 Habitual snoring, as defined by family or 
bed 
partner 
questionnaires, 
has 
been 
independently 
related 
to 
body 
mass 
index 
(BMI) 
90th 
percentile, 
poor 
academic 
performance and daytime sleepiness,2-4 hypertension, stroke, 
and 
ischemic 
heart 
disease. 
The 
majority 
of 
these 
studies 
identify 
snoring 
by 
history 
only. 
Very 
few 
studies 
classify 
snoring by objective measurements.1,5,6,7 


No 
universally 
accepted 
standard 
for 
measuring 
snoring 
has 
been 
developed. 
The 
official 
definition 
of 
snoring 
as 
“loud 
upper 
airway 
breathing 
sounds 
in 
sleep, 
without 
episodes 
of apnea or hyperventilation”8 falls short of recognizing 
that 
snoring 
occurs 
during 
obstructive 
breathing 
as 
well. 
Therefore, 
snoring 
has 
been 
subcategorized 
into 
“primary 
snoring,” 
which 
occurs 
without 
obstructive 
events,

Hunsaker and Riffenburgh Snoring significance in patients undergoing home . . . 

ondary snoring,”8 a component of upper-airway resistance 
syndrome. 
An 
attempt 
to 
localize 
the 
source 
of 
snoring 
based 
on 
the 
frequency 
of 
the 
sound 
produced 
by 
each 
of 
the 
projected 
sources 
of 
the 
sound, 
acoustic 
analysis, 
has 
been 
met 
with 
low 
sensitivity 
and 
specificity 
reports, 
as 
well 
as 
poor blinded accuracy (53%).6,9 


The 
literature 
reports 
measurement 
of 
snoring 
loudness 
at 
many 
sites 
in 
the 
laboratory 
and 
bedroom. 
The 
microphone 
has been placed in the nasopharynx,10 on the nasion, 
suspended 
24 
inches 
above 
the 
head, 
15 
to 
20 
cm 
above 
the 
head, 
at 
the 
suprasternal 
notch, 
on 
the 
neck, 
and 
on 
the 
chest 
wall.11 By placing a microphone on the nasion, Hoffstein 
et al12 measured respiratory sounds between 30 and 2,000 
Hz. 
Based 
on 
sophisticated 
observer 
blinded 
review 
of 
audio 
tapes, 
they 
concluded 
that 
the 
threshold 
of 
snoring 
is 
50 
dB. 
The 
present 
study 
used 
50 
dB 
as 
the 
threshold 
of 
snoring 
loudness. 
Hoffstein 
et 
al 
clearly 
showed 
that 
self-
perception 
of 
snoring 
poorly 
correlated 
and 
observer 
perception 
only 
moderately 
correlated 
with 
mean, 
maximum 
loudness, 
and snoring index (number of spikes over 50 dB/h).12 


Goal 


The 
goal 
is 
to 
introduce 
an 
objective 
method 
of 
measuring 
snoring 
incorporated 
in 
a 
new 
unattended 
home 
sleep-study 
device 
and 
to 
use 
it 
in 
assessing 
the 
relationship 
of 
a 
patient 
history 
of 
snoring 
to 
sleep 
complaints 
and 
demographic 
characteristics 
of 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea. 
The 
ultimate 
goal 
would 
be 
to 
include 
measurement 
of 
snoring 
loudness 
in 
all 
sleep 
studies. 
This 
in 
turn 
may 
justify 
the 
inclusion 
of 
snoring 
loudness 
measurement 
and 
treatment 
as 
a 
primary 
component 
of 
snoring 
and 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
syndrome 
(SOSAS). 


METHODS 


In 
the 
absence 
of 
an 
unequivocal 
definition, 
we 
used 
the 
following 
description 
of 
snoring 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
this 
study: 
snoring 
is 
excessively 
loud 
breathing 
sounds 
(which 
we 
defined 
as 
50 
dB) 
during 
sleep 
as 
measured 
near 
the 
source 
(upper 
lip). 


Equipment 


A 
consecutive 
database 
of 
unattended 
home 
sleep 
studies 
performed 
by 
the 
NovaSOM 
QSG 
(Sleep 
Solutions, 
Inc, 
Pasadena, 
MD) 
was 
retrospectively 
reviewed. 
This 
database 
contained 
4,860 
records. 
The 
NovaSOM 
QSG 
has 
been 
validated 
to 
be 
correlated 
to 
formal 
polysomnography 
(PSG). 
The 
correlation 
coefficient 
was 
0.96 
between 
the 
NovaSOM 
QSG 
and 
PSG. 
The 
sensitivity 
for 
detecting 
the 
apnea 
hypopnea 
index 
(AHI) 
15 
was 
85.7% 
and 
specificity 
was 
95.2%.13 The description of the NovaSOM technology to 
identify 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
syndrome 
has 
been 
published.
14,15 


Because 
this 
report 
focuses 
in 
detail 
on 
snoring 
as 
measured 
by 
this 
device, 
the 
design 
and 
research 
resulting 
in 
the 


respiratory 
and 
snoring 
sensor 
is 
detailed 
below 
from 
United States Patent No. 6,213,955.16 


A 
plastic 
device 
(breath 
sensor) 
is 
attached 
to 
the 
upper 
lip. 
It 
contains 
a 
horizontal 
acoustic 
channel 
from 
which 
8 
channels 
open 
at 
the 
nostrils 
and 
5 
channels 
open 
to 
the 
mouth 
for 
receiving 
breath 
flow 
turbulence 
and 
sounds. 
On 
the 
right 
end 
is 
a 
vibratory 
sensor 
microphone, 
which 
is 
exposed 
to 
the 
acoustic 
channel. 
A 
microphone 
exposed 
to 
the 
ambient 
space 
but 
not 
the 
acoustic 
channel 
samples 
breath sounds and ambient noise.17,18 The QSG sensor design 
is shown in Figure 1. 


Testing 
was 
conducted 
on 
NovaSom 
QSG 
breath 
sensors 
to 
validate 
the 
accuracy 
of 
sound 
measurement. 
Breath 
sensors 
were 
placed 
in 
a 
test 
chamber 
with 
airflow 
generated 
at 
a 
measured 
range 
of 
velocities. 
Electronic 
output 
signals 
were 
directly 
proportional 
and 
linear 
to 
the 
measured 
airflows, 
with 
no 
artifacts 
or 
distortion 
(Sleep 
Solutions, 
Inc, 
510K 
Submission, 
K000253, 
November 
2002). 


Figure 2 shows the result of this validation. NovaSom 
QSG 
breath 
sensors 
were 
additionally 
tested 
and 
showed 
correlation, 
over 
a 
full 
range 
of 
airflow 
levels, 
to 
pneumotachography, 
the 
recognized 
standard 
for 
airflow 
monitor


ing.17,18 


After 
preamplification 
and 
analog 
to 
digital 
conversion, 
the 
signals 
are 
filtered 
through 
sophisticated 
sound-canceling 
software 
to 
eliminate 
artifact 
and 
ambient 
noise. 
The 
breath 
sounds 
are 
analyzed 
to 
identify 
normal 
breath 
patterns. 
The 
waveform 
is 
then 
further 
analyzed 
in 
relation 
to 
a 
conventional 
scoring 
mechanism 
by 
using 
a 
standard 
PSG 
waveform 
as 
the 
model. 


Data 


This 
study 
is 
a 
component 
of 
a 
study 
approved 
by 
the 
Institutional 
Review 
Board 
at 
Naval 
Medical 
Center, 
San 
Diego, 
CA. 
The 
database 
contained 
anonymous 
records 
of 
4,858 
patients 
for 
whom 
snoring 
was 
measured 
by 
the 
QSG 
in 
unattended 
home 
sleep 
studies. 
The 
sample 
contained 
4,151 
males 
and 
707 
females, 
with 
an 
average 
age 
of 
54 
years 
(range, 
13-95). 
The 
average 
BMI, 
recorded 
in 
3,778 
records, 
was 
34, 
ranging 
from 
14 
to 
87. 
In 
the 
present 
study, 
we 
defined 
50 
dB 
as 
the 
threshold 
of 
snoring 
loudness. 
Three 
measures 
of 
snoring 
were 
recorded: 
(1) 
sustained 
loudness, 
measured 
as 
average 
loudness 
in 
dB 
of 
sleep 
breathing 
sounds, 
(2) 
peak 
loudness, 
measured 
as 
the 
loudest 
sleep 
sound 
in 
dB 
detected, 
and 
(3) 
duration, 
measured 
as 
the 
percent 
of 
time 
asleep 
in 
which 
snoring 
exceeded 
50 
dB. 
Snoring 
was 
a 
component 
of 
the 
chief 
complaint 
in 
2,624 
records. 
Review 
of 
the 
chief 
complaint 
data 
reveals 
a 
relationship 
between 
snoring 
and 
the 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
characteristics 
of 
daytime 
sleepiness, 
obesity, 
and 
chronic 
fatigue. 


RESULTS 


Snoring 
data 
were

the 
resulting

was 
converted 
to 
sound 
by

At 
specific 
airflow 
velocities, 
the 
measured 
sound 
was 
converted 
into 
a 
respiratory 
signal 
(plot

and 
compared 
with 
the

The 
result 
was 
a

the 
measured 
airflow.

median 
duration 
(percentage 
of 
time 
snoring) 
for 
these 
sleep-study 
patients 
increases 
from 
70.3% 
for 
normal 
BMI 
through 
89.3% 
for 
obese 
patients 
to 
93.9% 
for 
morbidly 
obese 
patients. 


We 
also 
examined 
daytime 
sleepiness 
measured 
by 
the 
Epworth 
Sleepiness 
Scale 
(ESS) 
as 
predicted 
by 
the 
apnea 
hypopnea 
index 
and 
snoring. 
A 
multiple 
regression 
of 
ESS 
was 
significantly 
predicted 
by 
duration 
of 
snoring 
(P 
. 
0.031) 
and 
sustained 
loudness 
(P 
. 
0.001) 
but 
not 
at 
all 
by 
peak loudness (P  0.716). We showed in Figure 4 that 
sustained 
loudness 
is 
related 
to 
AHI. 
Indeed, 
their 
correlation 
coefficient 
was 
0.62. 
We 
asked 
if 
snoring 
caused 
daytime 
sleepiness 
directly 
or 
only 
by 
virtue 
of 
its 
correlation 
with 
AHI. 
A 
multiple 
regression 
predicting 
ESS 
by 
both 
variables 
simultaneously 
indicates 
the 
level 
to 
which 
it 
depends 
on 
each, 
independent 
of 
their 
correlation 
with 
each 
other. 
Such 
a 
regression 
showed 
that 
ESS 
depended 
on 
both 
sustained 
loudness 
(P 
. 
0.001) 
and 
AHI 
(P 
. 
0.001).

examination 
of 
the

showed 
that

DISCUSSION 


The 
present 
study 
shows 
that 
the 
history 
of 
snoring 
on 
the 
consultation 
referral 
is 
highly 
related 
to 
obesity, 
excessive 
daytime 
sleepiness, 
and 
chronic 
fatigue 
symptoms. 
We 
also 
showed 
highly 
significant 
association 
between 
the 
duration 
of 
snoring, 
average 
sustained 
snoring 
loudness, 
and 
peak 
snoring 
loudness 
with 
the 
apnea 
hypopnea 
index 
and 
BMI 
and 
sustained 
loudness 
with 
the 
ESS. 
Average 
sustained 
loudness 
increased 
almost 
20 
dB 
between 
normal 
and 
severe 
AHI. 
Duration 
of 
sleep 
time 
spent 
snoring 
increased 
from 
73% 
for 
normal 
AHI 
(in 
patients 
referred 
for 
sleep 
study) 
to 
98% 
for 
severe 
AHI 
and 
increased 
from 
70% 
for 
normal 
BMI 
(in 
patients 
referred 
for 
sleep 
study) 
to 
94% 
for 
morbidly 
obese 
BMI. 


Excessive 
daytime 
sleepiness 
is 
related 
most 
strongly 
to 
the 
sustained 
loudness 
level 
rather 
than 
to 
short 
bursts 
of 
loudness 
or 
percent 
of 
sleep 
time 
spent 
snoring. 
A 
standard 
and 
universally 
accepted 
definition 
of 
snoring 
must 
be 
established 
to 
validate 
any 
studies 
on 
the 
independent 
clinical 
impact 
of 
snoring. 
The 
ideal 
definition 
of 
snoring 
should 
include 
its 
effect 
on 
the 
bed 
partner. 
Clearly, 
otolaryngologists 
see 
many 
patients 
who 
are 
brought 
to 
the 
office 
for 
snoring 
by 
their 
spouses 
who 
are 
clinically 
impacted 
by 
their own disturbed sleep.1 


Weaknesses 


Clearly, 
the 
greatest 
deficiency 
of 
Home 
Sleep 
Studies 
is 
the 
lack 
of 
electroencephalographic 
data 
and 
therefore 
the 
inability 
to 
measure 
the 
onset 
and 
interruption 
of 
sleep. 
The 
NovaSOM 
protocol 
dictates 
a 
30-minute 
delay 
at 
the 
start 
of 
the 
sleep 
study 
and 
after 
each 
disconnec

tion, 
assuming 
that 
the 
patient 
will 
require 
less 
than 
that 
time 
to 
initiate 
sleep. 
The 
validation 
studies 
appear 
to 
support this protocol.13-15 Laboratory PSG will always be 
the 
only 
testing 
method 
for 
complex 
sleep 
disorders 
(narcolepsy, 
restless 
leg 
motion, 
insomnia, 
and 
so 
on). 
Evidence 
is 
mounting, 
and 
the 
NovaSOM 
QSG 
validation 
studies 
show 
that 
laboratory 
PSG 
is 
not 
essential 
for 
the 
decision 
to 
prescribe 
treatment 
with 
a 
trial 
of 
continuous 
positive 
airway 
pressure 
(CPAP) 
for 
patients 
with 
SO


SAS.19,20 


There 
is 
no 
accepted 
definition 
of 
snoring 
and 
specifically 
the 
level 
of 
breathing 
loudness 
at 
which 
snoring 
should 
be 
measured. 
This 
report 
is 
intended 
to 
stimulate 
research 
to 
define 
snoring. 
We 
propose 
this 
analysis 
as 
a 
starting 
point 
for 
these 
studies. 


CONCLUSIONS 


This 
study 
suggests 
that 
snoring 
may 
be 
an 
independent 
factor 
in 
disturbed 
sleep. 
There 
is 
a 
subgroup 
of 
patients 
with 
normal 
AHI 
but 
who 
snore 
and 
have 
daytime 
sleepiness 
symptoms. 
Further 
work 
to 
define 
snoring 
should 
establish 
the 
most 
reliable 
measurement 
of 
loudness, 
the 
loudness 
threshold, 
and 
the 
clinical 
impact 
on 
the 
patient 
and 
bed 
partner. 
We 
submit 
that 
sound 
volume 
sufficient 
to 
disturb 
sleep 
is 
the 
most 
important 
data 
point 
that 
must 
be 
measured. 


We 
suggest, 
based 
on 
this 
work, 
that 
further 
research 
to 
define 
snoring 
should 
include 
(1) 
microphones 
placed 
at 
the 
upper 
lip 
sampling 
the 
nasal 
and 
oral 
sounds, 
(2) 
ambient 
sound 
from 
the 
sleep 
environment 
be 
collected 
and 
subtracted 
from 
the 
pure 
breath 
sounds, 
(3) 
loudness 
of 
breath 
sounds 
measured 
in 
decibels, 
(4) 
establishment 
of 
the 
threshold 
of 
snoring 
in 
decibels 
based 
on 
clinical 
impact 
on 
sleep 
(measured 
by 
electroencephalogram) 
and 
quality 
of 
life 
of 
the 
patient 
and 
bed 
partner, 
(5) 
inclusion 
of 
peak 
loudness 
and 
average 
loudness 
of 
breath 
sounds 
(over 
threshold), 
and 
(6) 
the 
duration 
and 
percentage 
of 
time 
of 
snoring 
over 
threshold 
(sample 
at 
50, 
55, 
and 
60 
dB 
to 
establish 
threshold). 


We 
recommend 
that 
future 
investigation 
be 
directed 
toward 
evolving 
an 
unequivocal 
definition 
of 
snoring 
that 
can 
be 
used 
by 
all 
investigators 
in 
future 
research 
on 
snoring. 
Further 
work 
based 
on 
these 
principles 
is 
underway. 
Although 
not 
recognized 
by 
third-party 
medical 
reimbursement 
organizations, 
snoring 
is 
an 
independent 
risk 
factor 
to 
the 
health 
of 
not 
only 
the 
snoring 
individual 
but 
to 
his/her 
bed 
partner.
