Purpose: 
Adenotonsillar 
hyperplasia 
causes 
upper 
airway 
obstruction, 
leading 
to 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea. 
We 
reviewed 
the 
incidence 
of 
nocturnal 
enuresis 
in 
a 
population 
of 
children 
with 
adenotonsillar 
hyperplasia. 
In 
addition, 
we 
investigated 
the 
rate 
of 
resolution 
or 
improvement 
in 
enuresis 
following 
surgery 
for 
relief 
of 
adenotonsillar 
hyperplasia. 
Materials 
and 
Methods: 
We 
studied 
86 
consecutive 
prepubertal 
children, 
46 
boys 
and 
40 
girls, 
who 
underwent 
adenotonsillectomy. 
Severity 
of 
adenotonsillar 
obstruction 
was 
graded 
on 
a 
scale 
of 
1 
to 
4. 
A 
questionnaire 
regarding 
voiding 
problems, 
including 
nocturnal 
enuresis, 
voids 
per 
day 
and 
daytime 
enuresis 
episodes, 
was 
filled 
out 
preoperatively 
and 
postoperatively 
by 
the 
patients 
and 
their 
parents. 
Results: 
Among 
the 
86 
patients 
who 
underwent 
adenotonsillectomy 
36 
(42%) 
had 
nocturnal 
enuresis. 
In 
patients 
with 
nocturnal 
enuresis 
the 
number 
of 
episodes 
was 
significantly 
less 
after 
adenotonsillectomy. 
Overall, 
12 
patients 
(33%) 
had 
complete 
resolution, 
11 
(31%) 
had 
significant 
improvement 
and 
13 
(36%) 
showed 
no 
change. 
In 
addition, 
we 
noted 
a 
significant 
decrease 
in 
daytime 
enuresis 
episodes 
and 
voids 
per 
day. 
Conclusions: 
Children 
with 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
have 
a 
high 
rate 
of 
nocturnal 
enuresis 
that 
improves 
at 
twice 
the 
anticipated 
rate 
after 
treatment 
of 
the 
airway 
obstruction. 
In 
addition, 
we 
observed 
that 
daytime 
voiding 
dysfunction 
improves 
in 
these 
patients.

octurnal 
enuresis, 
defined 
as 
involuntary 
urination 
during 
sleep, 
affects 
5 
million 
to 
7 
million 
children 
in 
the 
United 
States, 
making 
it 
the 
most 
common 
pediatric 
urological 
complaint 
facing 
primary 
care 
physicians 
today. 
Although 
the 
true 
incidence 
of 
enuresis 
is 
unknown 
because 
of 
the 
likelihood 
of 
underreporting, 
the 
reported 
rate 
is 
15% 
of 
5-year-olds.1 
Studies 
have 
demonstrated 
that 
approximately 
15% 
of 
children 
have 
resolution 
of 
symptoms 
each 
year, 
leading 
to 
an 
incidence 
of 
5% 
by 
age 
10, 
with 
only 
1% 
of 
adolescents 
remaining 
wet 
into 
adult 
life.2 


Although 
a 
common 
pediatric 
urinary 
problem, 
there 
is 
no 
clear-cut 
etiology 
for 
this 
ailment. 
Etiological 
factors 
include 
a 
number 
of 
possible 
mechanisms, 
such 
as 
genetic 
factors, 
sleep 
arousal 
dysfunction, 
nocturnal 
polyuria, 
psychological 
components, 
altered 
diurnal 
ADH 
secretion 
and 
maturational 
delay.3 
A 
relationship 
between 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
and 
enuresis 
has 
been 
suggested 
in 
previous 
case 
reports, 
case

and 
retrospective 
studies.4–9

the 
effect 
of 
surgical 
correction 
on 
urinary 
symptoms. 
We 
designed 
our 
study 
to 
address 
many 
of 
the 
questions 
left 
unanswered 
in 
previous 
reports. 
In 
particular, 
we 
studied 
only 
primary 
enuresis, 
evaluated 
individual 
resolution 
rates 
and 
attempted 
to 
obtain 
a 
high 
rate 
of 
followup. 
We 
also 
looked 
at 
the 
degree 
of 
adenotonsillar 
hyperplasia. 
In 
addition, 
we 
assessed 
daytime 
urinary 
symptoms 
in 
our 
patient 
population. 


PATIENTS 
AND 
METHODS 


We 
evaluated 
86 
consecutive 
children, 
46 
boys 
and 
40 
girls, 
operated 
on 
for 
symptomatic 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
secondary 
to 
adenotonsillar 
hyperplasia 
during 
2002 
and 
2003. 
Patient 
age 
ranged 
from 
3 
to 
10 
years 
(median 
5.7). 
Each 
patient 
underwent 
a 
thorough 
history, 
including 
a 
questionnaire 
regarding 
voiding 
pattern 
(completed 
by 
the 
patient 
with 
the 
parent 
present), 
and 
physical 
examination, 
which 
included 
grading 
of 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
on 
a 
scale 
of 
1 
to 
4, 
in 
order 
of 
increasing 
severity 
of 
obstruction 
(see 
Appendix). 
According 
to 
the 
accepted 
classification 
system, 
grade 
1 
represents 
less 
than 
25%, 
grade 
2, 
25% 
to 
50%, 
grade 
3, 
50% 
to 
75% 
and 
grade 
4 
greater 
than 
75% 
obstruction.
10 
Although 
this 
technique 
is 
not 
totally 
accurate, 
it 
has 
been 
established 
as 
the 
gold 
standard 
in 
the 
ENT 
literature. 


During 
postoperative 
followup 
(mean 
309 
. 
17 
days, 
range 
184 
to 
549) 
patients 
were 
asked 
to 
complete 
the 
same 
questionnaire 
that 
they 
had 
filled 
out 
preoperatively. 
We 
categorized 
the 
patients 
postoperatively 
into 
3 
groups— 
those 
with 
complete 
resolution 
of 
nocturnal 
enuresis, 
those 
with 
partial 
improvement 
and 
those 
with 
no 
significant 
change 
in 
urinary 
symptoms. 
In 
addition, 
improvement 
of 
upper 
airway 
obstructive 
symptoms 
was 
assessed 
postoperatively. 


In 
this 
small 
study 
we 
were 
able 
to 
reach 
100% 
of 
the 
patients 
enrolled. 
Since 
the 
patients 
were 
seen 
primarily 
at 
the 
ENT 
clinic 
for 
adenotonsillar 
hyperplasia, 
it 
is 
unlikely 
that 
medical 
treatment 
was 
carried 
out 
to 
address 
their 
nocturnal 
or 
daytime 
enuresis. 
No 
patient 
was 
counseled 
to 
adjust 
fluid 
intake 
during 
the 
course 
of 
the 
study. 
Only 
patients 
diagnosed 
with 
primary 
enuresis 
(as 
distinguished 
from 
those 
with 
secondary 
enuresis, 
who 
would 
have 
had 
a 
period 
of 
continence) 
were 
evaluated 
in 
this 
study. 


Statistical 
analysis 
was 
done 
using 
the 
paired 
Student 
t 
test 
or 
one-way 
ANOVA 
followed 
by 
the 
Tukey 
test 
for 
multiple 
comparisons. 
A 
p 
value 
of 
"0.05 
was 
considered 
statistically 
significant.

resolution 
of 
upper 
airway 
obstructive 
symptoms 
but 
had 
resolution 
of 
enuresis 
approximately 
1 
year 
postoperatively. 


The 
incidence 
of 
nocturnal 
enuresis 
in 
the 
entire 
study 
group 
before 
adenotonsillectomy 
was 
42% 
(36 
patients, 
21 
male 
and 
15 
female). 
There 
was 
no 
statistically 
significant 
difference 
in 
incidence 
based 
on 
gender. 
The 
distribution 
based 
on 
grade 
of 
adenotonsillar 
obstruction 
is 
outlined 
in 
table 
1. 
There 
was 
no 
direct 
correlation 
between 
grade 
of 
adenotonsillar 
obstruction 
and 
incidence 
of 
enuresis. 
Patients 
with 
enuresis 
were 
3 
to 
10 
years 
old 
(table 
2). 
There 
was 
a 
downward 
trend 
of 
enuresis 
as 
age 
increased, 
in 
keeping 
with 
that 
expected 
based 
on 
the 
literature.2 
However, 
the 
rates 
of 
enuresis 
were 
higher 
than 
expected 
in 
each 
age 
group. 


Of 
the 
patients 
with 
nocturnal 
enuresis 
preoperatively 
12 
(33%) 
had 
complete 
resolution 
of 
enuresis 
episodes, 
11 
(31%) 
had 
a 
significant 
improvement 
in 
the 
number 
of 
enuresis 
episodes 
and 
13 
(36%) 
had 
no 
change 
following 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
obstructive 
airway 
disease 
(table 
3). 
Our 
questionnaire 
also 
dealt 
with 
episodes 
of 
daytime 
enuresis 
and 
number 
of 
voids 
per 
day. 
Interestingly, 
all 
groups 
exhibited 
a 
significant 
reduction 
in 
daytime 
enuresis 
episodes 
and 
voids 
per 
day 
postoperatively 
(see 
Figure 
and 
table 
4). 
There 
were 
no 
differences 
noted 
when 
stratifying 
by 
gender. 
The 
severity 
of 
enuresis 
episodes, 
stratified 
as 
1 
to 
3 
episodes 
weekly 
and 
more 
than 
3 
episodes 
weekly, 
did 
not 
predict 
the 
likelihood 
of 
resolution 
or 
improvement 
in 
either 
nocturnal 
or 
daytime 
enuresis. 


DISCUSSION 


We 
found 
that 
42% 
of 
patients 
with 
known 
obstructive 
airway 
disease 
had 
nocturnal 
enuresis. 
This 
rate 
is 
similar 
to 
those 
previously 
reported 
in 
retrospective 
studies.5 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 
rate 
of 
enuresis 
in 
our 
population 
was 
considerably 
more 
than 
the 
expected 
rate 
of 
enuresis 
in 
this 
age 
range, 
and 
suggests 
that 
obstructive 
airway 
disease 
may 
have 
a 
role 
in 
the 
etiology 
of 
enuresis. 
We 
also 
found 
a 
high 
resolution 
rate 
of 
nocturnal 
enuresis 
after 
adenotonsillectomy. 
Overall, 
64% 
of 
our 
patients 
were 
improved 
and 
33% 
had 
complete 
resolution 
of 
enuresis. 
Although 
our 
rate 
of 
improvement 
is 
roughly 
equivalent 
to 
what 
has 
been 
reported 
previously, 
our 
complete 
resolution 
rate 
of 
33% 
is

only half of what was found in previous studies. We believe 
that this result is due to our more complete followup and 
strict exclusion criteria—most importantly, we evaluated 
only children with primary enuresis. Even so, our complete 
resolution rate of 33% is roughly twice what would be expected, 
and again suggests that upper airway obstruction 
may have a role in nocturnal enuresis in some patients. 
There are many explanations for why upper airway obstruction 
may cause nocturnal enuresis. Previous studies 
have shown that normal children excrete about 50% less 
urine during the night compared to daytime volume.11 This 
difference is likely due to the circadian rhythm of ADH 
secretion, in which levels are increased at night. This diurnal 
variation is reported to be disrupted in children with 
nocturnal enuresis. A failure to increase ADH secretion during 
the night results in the production of large amounts of 
dilute urine at night, exceeding functional bladder capacity 
and resulting in enuresis.12 This disruption in circadian 
ADH secretion may be linked to sleep apnea caused by upper 
airway obstruction. Relief of this upper airway obstruction, 
with resultant resolution of sleep apnea, may reestablish 
this diurnal ADH variation. 
However, there may be other novel explanations. In our 
study we also found a change in daytime voiding patterns 
after treatment of upper airway obstruction. Specifically, we 
noted a significant decrease in number of daytime enuresis 
episodes and number of voids per day, defined as greater 
than 50% reduction, in nearly every subgroup of patients, 
including those who did not demonstrate any change in 
nocturnal enuresis. This finding was most surprising in 
patients whose nocturnal enuresis resolved. If fluid intake is 
unchanged and ADH kinetics improve, this group might be 
expected to have a greater daytime urine output, and, therefore, 
more voids per day. 
The fact that our patients had fewer voids per day and 
less daytime incontinence after adenotonsillectomy is surprising, 
and suggests that upper airway obstruction may 
also be involved in daytime urinary incontinence. This finding 
poses new questions that have not been addressed in 
previous studies. The fact that there is a change in voiding 
pattern during the daytime suggests another mechanism is 
partly responsible for loss of urinary control. The mechanism 
is unclear but is not likely to be related to ADH secretion. 
One explanation might be spontaneous resolution with 
time. On the other hand, something as simple as the trauma 
of surgery/anesthesia may have a role. In addition, there 
may be a change in functional bladder capacity postoperatively, 
allowing improved storage of urine with concomitant 
decrease in enuresis episodes. This increase in functional 
capacity may be the result of a change in the hormonal 
milieu postoperatively. Although these theories may have a 
role in our outcomes, further studies in this area are clearly 
needed. 
Since it is likely that adenotonsillar obstruction develops 
with time, the age at which it becomes significant may affect 
whether patients have primary or secondary enuresis. If 
early, patients may never be dry, but if obstruction develops 
later (after the age of normal toilet training), adenotonsillar 
obstruction may be a major cause of secondary enuresis. If 
so, surgery for the obstruction may be even more beneficial 
in this group. Our study excluded these patients but this 
would constitute an important followup investigation. 
One weakness of our study is the long mean followup of 
approximately 10 months. The reason followup was so 
lengthy is that it was conducted at an ENT clinic and was 
less regular than would be optimal. Indeed, some patients 
who failed to appear for followup had to be called in later. 
Although one may argue that some patients may have had 
resolved or improved urinary symptoms with time, the resolution 
rate in our study population was twice that previously 
reported in the general population.2 Another weakness 
is that a true control group was lacking in our study, namely 
patients with symptomatic upper airway obstruction and 
enuresis treated without surgical intervention. Although a 
difficult study to perform in the United States, it might be 
possible to address this weakness in a country with longer 
wait times for ENT surgery. 
CONCLUSIONS 
We have shown an increased incidence of nocturnal enuresis 
in patients with symptomatic upper airway obstruction. 
Furthermore, we have demonstrated that relief of upper

be 
aware 
of 
the 
possibility

EDITORIAL 
COMMENT 


The 
authors 
present 
some 
interesting 
observations 
in 
children 
with 
nocturnal 
and 
diurnal 
enuresis 
that 
will 
probably 
be 
new 
to 
most 
urologists. 
The 
observation 
that 
children 
with 
nasal 
obstruction 
have 
a 
high 
incidence 
of 
primary 
nocturnal 
enuresis 
and 
that 
correcting 
this 
problem 
seems 
to 
improve 
the 
resolution 
rate 
is 
interesting. 
However, 
the 
finding 
that 
those 
with 
diurnal 
enuresis 
also 
improve 
is 
unexpected 
and 
hard 
to 
explain. 
The 
explanation 
may 
be 
chance, 
helped 
by 
a 
long 
interval 
between 
nasal 
surgery 
and 
reassessment 
(18 
months 
in 
1 
case). 
As 
the 
authors 
have 
indicated, 
the 
lack 
of 
controls 
is 
also 
a 
problem. 
The 
fact 
that 
all 
patients 
had 
primary 
enuresis 
raises 
the 
question, 
does 
acquired 
nasal 
obstruction 
exacerbate 
primary 
enuresis 
or 
induce 
it, 
and 
is 
the 
mechanism 
the 
same? 
Hopefully, 
some 
of 
these 
questions 
will 
be 
answered 
in 
future 
studies.
