Objective: 
To 
assess 
the 
change 
in 
disease-specific 
quality 
of 
life 
(QOL) 
in 
pediatric 
patients 
with 
obstructive 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
(OSDB) 
secondary 
to 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy 
after 
powered 
intracapsular 
tonsillectomy 
and 
adenoidectomy. 


Design: 
Prospective 
outcomes 
study. 


Setting: 
Hospital-based 
pediatric 
otolaryngology 
practice. 


Patients: 
Fifty 
children 
with 
a 
mean 
age 
of 
4.5 
years 
who 
had 
a 
clinical 
diagnosis 
of 
OSDB. 


Interventions: 
A 
caregiver 
of 
qualifying 
patients 
completed 
a 
validated 
QOL 
survey 
of 
pediatric 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea, 
the 
OSA-18 
(Obstructive 
Sleep 
Apnea-18), 
preoperatively 
and 
3 
months 
and 
1 
year 
postoperatively. 


Main 
Outcome 
Measure: 
The 
OSA-18 
mean 
change 
scores. 


Results: 
The 
mean 
(SD) 
total 
OSA-18 
change 
score 
at 
the 
3-month 
follow-up 
visit 
was 
2.3 
(1.2) 
and 
at 
the 
1 
year 
follow-up 
visit 
was 
2.2 
(1.3). 
The 
total 
and 
individual 
domain 
change 
scores 
were 
significantly 
improved 
at 
both 
postoperative 
intervals 
(P.001 
for 
all). 
There 
were 
no 
significant 
changes 
in 
the 
total 
or 
domain 
change 
scores 
between 
the 
intervals. 
The 
total 
change 
score 
was 
not 
significantly 
associated 
with 
either 
tonsil 
size 
or 
tonsil 
position. 


Conclusion: 
The 
OSDB-related 
QOL 
is 
significantly 
improved 
after 
powered 
intracapsular 
tonsillectomy 
and 
adenoidectomy, 
and 
this 
improvement 
remains 
stable 
even 
after 
1 
year.

HE 
QUEST 
FOR 
THE 
ELIMINAtion 
of 
tonsillectomy-
associated 
morbidity 
has 
vexed 
several 
generations 
of 
otolaryngologists. 
Postoperative 
pain, 
with 
its 
attendant 
sequelae 
of 
delayed 
return 
to 
normal 
diet 
and 
activity, 
is 
experienced 
by 
most 
patients. 
This 
pain 
is 
attributed 
to 
exposure 
of 
the 
pharyngeal 
musculature 
to 
injury, 
saliva, 
bacterial 
colonization, 
and 
subsequent 
inflammation. 
Delayed 
postoperative 
hemorrhage 
still 
occurs 
in 
1% 
to 
3% 
of 
patients1 
and 
is 
due 
to 
the 
exposure 
of 
stumps 
of 
primary 
tonsillar 
feeding 
vessels. 
The 
pediatric 
population 
is 
especially 
vulnerable 
to 
these 
insults, 
with 
a 
greater 
propensity 
for 
dehydration 
and 
life-
threatening 
hemorrhage. 


The 
latest 
development 
in 
thwarting 
these 
complications 
is 
the 
resurgence 
of 
partial 
tonsillectomy. 
Eschewed 
in 
the 
early 
20th 
century 
as 
a 
treatment 
for 
recurrent 
infection 
due 
to 
persistent 
symptoms 
from 
residual 
tissue, 
this 
procedure 
has 
been 
reexamined 
for 
its 
role 
in 
the 
treatment 
of 
children 
with 
obstructive 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
(OSDB). 
Al


though 
many 
techniques 
have 
been 
used, 
microdebridement 
has 
gained 
popularity 
for 
its 
superior 
speed 
and 
control.2-7 
In 
this 
procedure, 
the 
microdebrider 
shaves 
away 
most 
of 
the 
tonsil, 
leaving 
a 
small 
rim 
overlying 
the 
capsule. 
This 
“biological 
dressing” 
protects 
the 
pharyngeal 
muscles. 
Blood 
vessels 
are 
thought 
to 
be 
cut 
distal 
to 
arborization; 
thus, 
the 
exposed 
stumps 
are 
from 
smaller-caliber 
vessels. 
Regrowth 
remains 
a 
concern 
with 
partial 
tonsillectomy, 
and 
the 
long-term 
incidence 
has 
yet 
to 
be 
determined. 
Two 
studies4,7 
have 
quantified 
early 
regrowth 
across 
1 
to 
2 
years 
as 
0.46% 
and 
3.2%, 
respectively. 


The 
studies 
published 
thus 
far 
are 
promising. 
Retrospective 
studies2-4 
comparing 
microdebrider-assisted 
powered 
intracapsular 
tonsillectomy 
and 
adenoidectomy 
(PITA) 
with 
total 
Bovie 
tonsillectomy 
and 
adenoidectomy 
revealed 
significantly 
less 
postoperative 
pain 
and 
use 
of 
analgesics 
and 
quicker 
return 
to 
normal 
diet 
and 
activity 
in 
the 
PITA 
group. 
The 
largest 
of 
these 
studies4 
showed 
a 
significant 
reduction 
in 
delayed 
postoperative 
bleeding 
and 
hospital 
readmission 
for 
dehydration.

masked 
studies 
have 
been 
published 
that 
show 
more 
modest 
benefits. 
Derkay 
et 
al5 
found 
that 
the 
PITA 
group 
returned 
to 
normal 
activity 
and 
stopped 
taking 
pain 
medications 
sooner, 
whereas 
Sobol 
et 
al6 
found 
only 
an 
earlier 
return 
to 
normal 
activity. 
Finally, 
a 
recent 
randomized, 
double-masked, 
paired, 
controlled 
study 
by 
Lister 
et 
al8 
demonstrated 
that 
children 
noted 
significantly 
less 
postoperative 
pain 
on 
the 
microdebrider 
tonsillectomy 
side 
than 
on 
the 
Bovie 
tonsillectomy 
side. 
These 
studies 
did 
not 
find 
significant 
differences 
between 
the 
groups 
with 
respect 
to 
postoperative 
complications. 


The 
main 
focus 
of 
this 
study 
is 
to 
assess 
the 
change 
in 
OSDB-related 
quality 
of 
life 
(QOL) 
after 
PITA. 
We 
used 
2 
separate 
intervals: 
3 
months 
and 
1 
year 
postoperatively. 
Change 
in 
QOL 
at 
1 
year 
may 
be 
affected 
by 
tonsil 
regrowth. 
We 
used 
a 
validated 
QOL 
survey 
of 
pediatric 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea, 
the 
OSA-18 
(Obstructive 
Sleep 
Apnea-18), 
which 
has 
been 
shown 
to 
have 
excellent 
reliability 
and 
has 
been 
validated 
as 
a 
discriminative 
instrument 
using 
polysomnography9 
and 
as 
an 
evaluative 
survey 
to 
demonstrate 
longitudinal 
change.10 


We 
also 
addressed 
a 
second 
question 
in 
this 
study: 
Are 
all 
tonsils 
treated 
equally 
by 
PITA, 
or 
should 
this 
procedure 
be 
reserved 
for 
larger, 
exophytic 
tonsils? 
With 
endophytic 
tonsils, 
a 
larger 
percentage 
of 
the 
tonsil 
may 
be 
left 
behind, 
and 
this 
may 
have 
consequences 
in 
early 
relief 
of 
OSDB 
and 
regrowth 
of 
tonsillar 
tissue 
across 
time. 
Therefore, 
we 
examined 
change 
in 
QOL 
with 
respect 
to 
tonsil 
size 
and 
tonsil 
position 
(exophytic, 
endophytic, 
or 
mixed). 


METHODS
The 
protocol 
for 
this 
study 
was 
reviewed 
and 
approved 
by 
the 
State 
University 
of 
New 
York 
Downstate 
Medical 
Center 
and 
Long 
Island 
College 
Hospital 
institutional

PATIENTS 


A 
convenience 
sample 
of 
50 
children 
who 
underwent 
PITA 
for 
OSDB 
between 
June 
1, 
2004, 
and 
March 
31, 
2005, 
were 
recruited. 
Caregivers 
were 
counseled 
about 
the 
risks 
and 
benefits 
of 
PITA 
and 
total 
monopolar 
electrocautery 
tonsillectomy, 
and 
they 
opted 
for 
the 
former 
procedure. 
Caregiver 
informed 
consent 
was 
obtained, 
as 
was 
assent 
from 
all 
patients 
older 
than 
7 
years. 
The 
OSA-18 
was 
completed 
in 
writing 
by 
each 
caregiver 
on 
the 
day 
of 
surgery, 
3 
months 
postoperatively, 
and 
1 
year 
postoperatively. 
The 
3-month 
interval 
was 
chosen 
as 
the 
time 
when 
postoperative 
healing 
is 
complete, 
and 
the 
1-year 
interval 
as 
the 
longest 
time 
that 
follow-up 
could 
be 
reasonably 
obtained 
without 
attrition 
of 
the 
study 
group. 
In 
addition, 
these 
periods 
have 
been 
used 
in 
previous 
related 
studies. 


The 
inclusion 
criteria 
were 
age 
6 
months 
through 
12 
years, 
history 
of 
snoring 
and 
disrupted 
sleep 
for 
3 
months 
or 
longer, 
and 
being 
scheduled 
for 
PITA 
as 
part 
of 
routine 
clinical 
care. 
The 
exclusion 
criteria 
were 
previous 
tonsil 
or 
adenoid 
surgery, 
Down 
or 
another 
syndrome 
involving 
the 
head 
and 
neck, 
neuromuscular 
disorders, 
cleft 
palate 
or 
previous 
pharyngeal 
surgery, 
known 
cognitive 
deficit 
or 
mental 
retardation, 
known 
psychiatric 
disorders, 
and 
inability 
of 
the 
caregiver 
to 
read 
and 
understand 
English. 
Twenty-one 
of 
50 
patients 
(42%) 
underwent 
preoperative 
polysomnography. 
The 
mean 
(SD) 
preoperative 
apnea-hypopnea 
index 
was 
12.5 
(12.1). 
Ten 
of 
these 
patients 
had 
no 
desaturations; 
of 
those 
who 
did, 
the 
mean 
lowest 
oxygen 
desaturation 
was 
86.4%. 


SURGICAL 
TECHNIQUE 


All 
the 
patients 
underwent 
PITA 
performed 
by 
or 
under 
the 
supervision 
of 
2 
attending 
surgeons 
(N.A.G. 
and 
Ari 
J. 
Goldsmith, 
MD). 
The 
patient 
was 
placed 
in 
the 
Rose 
position. 
A 
mouth 
gag 
was 
applied 
to 
retract 
the 
mandible. 
Red 
rubber 
catheters 
were 
placed 
via 
the 
nares 
and 
were 
used 
to 
retract 
the 
soft 
palate. 
Adenoidectomy 
was 
performed 
using 
direct 
mirror 
visualization 
with 
the 
microdebrider. 
The 
nasopharynx 
was 
packed 
with 
tonsil 
packs. 
A 
Hurd 
retractor 
was 
used 
to 
medialize 
the 
tonsil 
while 
the 
microdebrider 
was 
used 
to 
remove 
the 
tonsillar 
tissue, 
leaving 
a 
rim 
of 
tissue 
overlying 
the 
capsule. 
The 
suction 
cautery 
was 
then 
used 
for 
hemostasis 
in 
the 
cut 
tonsil 
and 
adenoid 
surfaces. 
All 
the 
patients 
received 
a 
single 
dose 
of 
intravenous 
dexamethasone 
sodium 
phosphate, 
0.5 
mg/kg, 
pre-
operatively 
and 
10 
days 
of 
postoperative 
amoxicillin 
sodium 
or 
an 
equivalent 
for 
penicillin-allergic 
patients. 


OUTCOME 
MEASURES 


The 
OSA-18 
consists 
of 
18 
items 
grouped 
into 
5 
domains: 
sleep 
disturbance, 
physical 
symptoms, 
emotional 
distress, 
daytime 
function, 
and 
caregiver 
concerns. 
Items 
are 
scored 
on 
a 
7-point 
ordinal 
scale 
that 
assesses 
the 
frequency 
of 
specific 
symptoms, 
scored 
as 
follows: 
1, 
none 
of 
the 
time; 
2, 
hardly 
any 
of 
the 
time; 
3, 
a 
little 
of 
the 
time; 
4, 
some 
of 
the 
time; 
5, 
a 
good 
bit 
of 
the 
time; 
6, 
most 
of 
the 
time; 
and 
7, 
all 
of 
the 
time. 
Item 
responses 
are 
summed 
to 
produce 
a 
total 
score 
ranging 
from 
18 
(best 
QOL) 
to 
126 
(poorest 
QOL). 
A 
total 
score 
less 
than 
60 
suggests 
a 
small 
impact 
on 
disease-specific 
QOL, 
scores 
of 
60 
to 
80 
suggest 
a 
moderate 
impact, 
and 
scores 
greater 
than 
80 
suggest 
a 
large 
impact. 
A 
mean 
survey 
score 
and 
individual 
domain 
mean 
scores 
are 
also 
calculated. 
The 
OSA-18 
change 
scores 
are 
calculated 
by 
subtracting 
the 
follow-up 
mean 
survey 
score 
and 
the 
individual 
domain 
mean 
scores 
from 
the 
baseline 
mean 
and 
individual 
domain 
mean 
scores. 
Positive 
values 
indicate 
clinical 
improvement 
and 
negative 
values 
indicate 
deterioration. 
A 
change 
score 
of 
less 
than 
0.5 
indicates 
trivial 
change; 
0.5 
to 
0.9, 
small 
change; 
1.0 
to 
1.4, 
moderate 
change; 
and 
1.5 
or 
greater, 
large 
change.9,10 


Tonsil 
size 
and 
position 
were 
scored 
intraoperatively. 
Tonsil 
size 
was 
scored 
from 
1. 
through 
4. 
based 
on 
the 
decrease 
in 
pharyngeal 
lumen 
diameter: 
1,0%to25%;2, 
26% 
to 
50%; 
3, 
51% 
to 
75%; 
and 
4, 
76% 
to 
100%.11 
Tonsil 
position 
was 
scored 
based 
on 
protrusion 
of 
the 
tonsil 
beyond 
the 
medial 
border 
of 
the 
anterior 
pillar: 
exophytic, 
greater 
than 
50% 
of 
the 
tonsil 
mass 
medial 
to 
the 
pillar; 
endophytic, 
less 
than 
50% 
medial 
to 
the 
pillar; 
and 
mixed, 
exactly 
50% 
medial 
to 
the 
pillar. 


SAMPLE 
SIZE 
ESTIMATION 


Assuming 
a 
standardized 
difference, 
defined 
as 
the 
change 
score 
divided 
by 
the 
standard 
deviation 
of 
0.50 
(moderate 
effect), 


=.05, 
and 
80% 
power, 
34 
patients 
were 
required 
to 
complete 
the 
study. 
Assuming 
a 
dropout 
rate 
of 
32% 
(16 
patients), 
we 
recruited 
a 
total 
of 
50 
patients. 
STATISTICAL 
ANALYSIS 


Exact 
Wilcoxon 
signed 
rank 
tests 
were 
conducted 
on 
the 
change 
scores 
at 
3 
months 
and 
1 
year. 
Spearman 
correlations 
of 
change 
scores 
with 
tonsil 
size 
were 
computed 
along 
with 
their 
corresponding 
exact 
P 
values. 
Comparison 
of 
median 
change 
scores 
by 
tonsil 
position 
(exophytic 
vs 
endophytic 
vs 
mixed) 
was 
performed 
using 
exact 
Kruskal-Wallis 
tests. 
Adjustment 
of 
P 
values 
for 
multiple 
tests 
was 
performed 
using 
the 
method 
of 
Holm.12 
All 
analyses 
were 
performed 
using 
a

RESULTS
Fifty 
patients 
underwent 
PITA: 
34 
boys 
and 
16 
girls. 
The 
age 
range 
was 
1 
to 
12 
years, 
with 
a 
mean 
of 
4.5 
years. 
There 
were 
no 
cases 
of 
immediate 
hemorrhage, 
delayed 
hemorrhage, 
or 
dehydration. 
Thirty-eight 
3-month 
postoperative 
surveys 
(76%) 
and 
43 
1-year 
surveys 
(86%) 
were 
returned. 
The 
degree 
of 
baseline 
oropharyngeal 
obstruction 
caused 
by 
the 
tonsils 
was 
as 
follows: 
1, 
0 
patients; 
2, 
8 
patients 
(16%); 
3, 
20 
patients 
(40%); 
and 
4, 
22 
patients 
(44%). 
Tonsil 
position 
was 
exophytic 
in 
19 
patients 
(38%), 
endophytic 
in 
9 
(18%), 
and 
mixed 
in 
22 
(44%). 


The 
mean 
(SD) 
preoperative 
OSA-18 
score 
was 
4.0 
(1.4). 
The 
mean 
(SD) 
total 
change 
score 
at 
the 
3-month 
follow-up 
visit 
was 
2.3 
(1.2) 
and 
at 
the 
1-year 
follow-up 
visit 
was 
2.2 
(1.3) 
(Table). 
Exact 
Wilcoxon 
signed 
rank 
tests 
of 
change 
from 
before 
surgery 
to 
3 
months 
and 
from 
before 
surgery 
to 
1 
year 
were 
significant 
at 
P.001 
for 


the 
total 
score 
and 
for 
all 
5 
domains; 
P 
values 
were 
still 
significant 
at 
that 
level 
after 
adjustment 
for 
multiple 
tests. 
There 
were 
no 
significant 
changes 
in 
the 
total 
or 
domain 
change 
scores 
between 
3 
months 
and 
1 
year 
postoperatively 
(P=.74 
for 
the 
total 
score). 


Preoperative 
impact 
on 
QOL 
was 
small 
for 
17 
patients 
(34%), 
moderate 
for 
15 
(30%), 
and 
large 
for 
18 
(36%). 
At 
the 
3-month 
follow-up, 
the 
change 
in 
disease-
specific 
QOL 
from 
baseline 
was 
trivial 
for 
2 
of 
38 
children 
(5%), 
small 
for 
2 
(5%), 
moderate 
for 
7 
(18%), 
and 
large 
for 
27 
(71%) 
(Figure). 
At 
the 
1-year 
interval, 
the 
change 
in 
QOL 
from 
baseline 
was 
trivial 
for 
5 
of 
43 
children 
(12%), 
small 
for 
4 
(9%), 
moderate 
for 
7 
(16%), 
and 
large 
for 
27 
(63%) 
(Figure). 
The 
total 
change 
score 
was 
not 
significantly 
associated 
with 
either 
tonsil 
size 
(P=.17 
for 
3 
months 
and 
P=.20 
for 
1 
year) 
or 
tonsil 
position 
(P=.86 
for 
3 
months 
and 
P=.72 
for 
1 
year). 


COMMENT
The 
OSDB-related 
QOL 
has 
been 
addressed 
in 
some 
of 
the 
earlier 
studies 
of 
PITA. 
In 
the 
retrospective 
analysis 
by 
Koltai 
et 
al,3 
caregivers 
were 
asked 
to 
classify 
postoperative 
improvement 
in 
QOL 
as 
mild, 
moderate, 
or 
marked. 
Improvement 
was 
significant 
in 
the 
total 
and 
partial 
tonsillectomy 
groups, 
without 
significant 
intergroup 
differences. 
Derkay 
et 
al5 
prospectively 
assessed 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea–related 
QOL 
at 
baseline 
and 
at 
1 
month 
using 
a 
validated 
disease-specific 
survey, 
the 
OSD-6 
(Obstructive 
Sleep 
Disorders-6). 
Patients 
in 
the 
electrocautery 
and 
microdebrider 
groups 
demonstrated 
significant 
improvement 
in 
all 
indices. 
However, 
there 
was 
a 
significantly 
larger 
decrease 
in 
the 
microdebrider 
group 
for 
emotional 
distress 
and 
activity 
limitation 
4 
weeks 
postoperatively. 
The 
present 
results 
similarly 
demonstrate 
significant 
improvement 
in 
the 
overall 
OSA-18 
score 
and 
in 
each 
of 
the 
5 
domains 
for 
the 
3-month 
and 
1-year 
intervals, 
with 
34 
patients 
(85%) 
experiencing 
a 
moderate 
to 
large 
change 
in 
QOL 
at 
3 
months 
and 
34 
(79%) 
experiencing 
a 
moderate 
to 
large 
change 
at 
1 
year. 
This 
small 
difference 
did 
not 
prove 
to 
be 
significant. 


The 
mean 
(SD) 
total 
change 
score 
at 
3-month 
follow-
up 
of 
2.3 
(1.2) 
was 
similar 
to 
the 
findings 
of 
2 
previous 
studies 
by 
Tran 
et 
al13 
and 
Goldstein 
et 
al14 
that 
used 
the 
OSA-18 
to 
evaluate 
QOL 
in 
children 
with

ter 
total 
electrocautery 
tonsillectomy 
and 
adenoidectomy. 
In 
these 
studies, 
the 
total 
change 
scores 
at 
3-month 
follow-up 
were 
a 
mean 
(SD) 
of 
2.5 
(1.2)13 
and 
a 
mean 
of 


2.3 
(95% 
confidence 
interval, 
1.9-2.7).14 
Mitchell 
et 
al15 
also 
used 
the 
OSA-18 
to 
evaluate 
long-term 
(12-month) 
changes 
in 
QOL 
after 
total 
tonsillectomy 
and 
adenoidectomy 
in 
children 
with 
polysomnographic 
findings 
positive 
for 
OSA. 
The 
mean 
total 
change 
score 
at 
12 
months 
was 
2.3 
(95% 
confidence 
interval, 
2.0-2.6), 
which 
agrees 
with 
the 
mean 
(SD) 
total 
change 
score 
of 
2.2 
(1.3) 
in 
this 
study. 
These 
results 
suggest 
that 
the 
improvements 
in 
QOL 
after 
PITA 
are 
similar 
to 
the 
improvements 
after 
total 
tonsillectomy 
and 
adenoidectomy. 
There 
has 
been 
concern 
that 
larger, 
exophytic 
tonsils 
would 
be 
more 
amenable 
to 
PITA 
than 
smaller, 
endophytic 
tonsils 
because 
more 
of 
the 
tonsil 
can 
be 
removed 
and 
there 
would 
be 
less 
risk 
of 
tonsil 
regrowth. 
In 
the 
present 
study, 
tonsil 
size 
and 
position 
did 
not 
significantly 
affect 
the 
OSA-18 
change 
score 
at 
either 
interval. 
This 
suggests 
that 
tonsil 
size 
and 
position 
relative 
to 
the 
anterior 
tonsillar 
pillar 
should 
not 
limit 
the 
use 
of 
this 
procedure 
for 
children 
with 
OSDB, 
although 
longer 
follow-up 
is 
needed 
to 
fully 
assess 
the 
risk 
of 
tonsil 
regrowth. 


The 
overall 
success 
of 
total 
tonsillectomy 
and 
adenoidectomy 
in 
normalizing 
polysomnographic 
indices 
was 
reported 
to 
be 
82.9% 
(random-effects 
model 
95% 
confidence 
interval, 
76.2%-89.5%).16 
The 
present 
patients 
did 
not 
undergo 
routine 
preoperative 
or 
postoperative 
polysomnography, 
so 
the 
efficacy 
of 
PITA 
in 
normalizing 
polysomnographic 
measurements 
is 
unknown. 
On 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
polysomnography 
results 
of 
the 
42% 
of 
patients 
who 
had 
preoperative 
studies, 
our 
patient 
population 
predominantly 
had 
mild 
to 
moderate 
OSDB. 
We 
do 
not 
know 
if 
the 
severity 
of 
OSA 
affects 
the 
success 
of 
PITA. 


Strengths 
of 
this 
study 
include 
its 
prospective 
nature, 
the 
use 
of 
a 
psychometrically 
sound 
survey 
instrument, 
and 
the 
inclusion 
of 
short-and 
long-term 
follow-
up. 
Weaknesses 
include 
the 
lack 
of 
control 
group 
randomization 
and 
blinding 
and 
a 
relatively 
small 
sample 
size 
and 
incomplete 
follow-up. 
Although 
children 
as 
old 
as 
12 
years 
were 
enrolled, 
the 
sample 
is 
skewed 
toward 
younger 
children, 
as 
evidenced 
by 
the 
mean 
age 
of 
4.5 
years. 
A 
larger 
study 
with 
an 
older 
mean 
patient 
age 
may 
have 
produced 
different 
results. 
A 
controlled, 
preferably 
randomized, 
study 
is 
needed 
to 
fully 
assess 
the 
efficacy 
of 
PITA. 


In 
conclusion, 
these 
outcomes 
corroborate 
previous 
studies 
that 
have 
shown 
significant 
improvements 
in 
OSDB-related 
QOL 
after 
PITA; 
our 
study 
shows 
that 
this 
benefit 
persists 
even 
after 
1 
year. 
Additional 
studies 
using 
objective 
measures 
of 
OSDB 
will 
further 
clarify 
PITA’s 
efficacy, 
and 
longer-term 
data 
will 
help 
determine 
the 
frequency 
and 
clinical 
impact 
of 
tonsil 
regrowth. 
These 
results 
also 
suggest 
that 
PITA 
is 
as 
effective 
as 
total 
tonsillectomy 
in 
improving 
QOL 
and 
that 
surgeons 
should 
not 
use 
tonsil 
size 
or 
position 
as 
a 
significant 
variable 
in 
choosing 
this 
procedure.
