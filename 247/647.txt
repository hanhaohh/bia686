SUMMARY 


The 
goal 
of 
this 
study 
was 
to 
characterize 
sleep 
and 
respiratory 
parameters 
in 
children 
with 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
(SDB) 
as 
compared 
to 
children 
without 
SDB. 
Data 
are 
from 
198 
children 
and 
adolescents 
referred 
for 
sleep 
center 
evaluation, 
128 
of 
whom 
were 
diagnosed 
with 
SDB. 
In 
children 
with 
SDB, 
obesity 
(> 
95% 
wgt 
for 
age) 
was 
more 
common 
than 
being 
severely 
underweight 
(< 
5% 
wgt 
for 
age), 
but 
only 
the 
older 
children 
with 
SDB 
were 
heavier 
than 
age-matched 
normal 
sleepers. 
Children 
with 
SDB 
had 
increased 
EEG 
arousals; 
sleep 
architecture 
was 
not 
otherwise 
significantly 
different 
from 
the 
non-SDB 
group. 
African-American 
children 
with 
SDB 
had 
significantly 
greater 
oxygen 
desaturation 
with 
obstructive 
events 
compared 
to 
Caucasian 
and 
Latino 
children. 
It 
appears 
that 
the 
role 
of 
obesity 
as 
a 
risk 
factor 
for 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
(OSA) 
increases 
in 
children 
above 
the 
age 
of 
8-years. 
Additionally, 
African-American 
children 
with 
SDB 
may 
be 
at 
increased 
risk 
for 
hypoxemia 
and 
cardiovascular 
consequences 
of 
SDB.

INTRODUCTION 


Sleep-disordered 
breathing 
(SDB) 
has 
been 
described 
in 
children 
for 
many 
years, 
but 
it 
has 
not 
been 
as 
extensively 
studied 
as 
SDB 
in 
adults. 
Much 
of 
what 
is 
known 
about 
pediatric 
SDB 
has 
been 
derived 
from 
clinical 
case 
series 
(Guilleminault 
et 
al. 
1981; 
Brouilette 
et 
al. 
1982; 
Frank 
et 
al. 
1983). 
There 
is 
an 
emphasis 
on 
quantification 
of 
oxygen 
saturation 
by 
pulse 
oximetry 
(SpO2) 
and 
end-tidal 
carbon 
dioxide 
(PETCO2) 
during 
sleep 
in 
the 
pediatric 
literature, 
often 
with 
less 
complete 
analysis 
of 
sleep 
architecture, 
daytime 
function, 
and 
clinical 
features 
of 
children 
with 
SDB. 


One 
reason 
that 
SDB 
in 
children 
has 
not 
been 
more 
comprehensively 
studied 
may 
be 
that 
it 
was 
thought 
to 
be 
more 
rare 
than 
SDB 
in 
adults. 
However, 
a 
recent 
epidemiologic 
study 
estimates 
the 
lower 
limit 
of 
the 
prevalence 
of 
OSA 
syndrome 
in 
children 
of 
ages 
6 
months 
to 
6 
years 
to 
be 
2.9% 
(Gislason 
and 
Benediktsdo´ttir 
1995). 
This 
estimate 
is 
similar 
to 
the 
prevalence 
found 
in 
adults 
by 
these 
same 
investigators

using 
a 
similar 
methodology 
(Gislason 
et 
al. 
1988; 
Gislason 
et 
al. 
1993), 
and 
is 
comparable 
to 
what 
has 
been 
reported 
for 
middle-aged 
adults 
by 
other 
investigators 
(Young 
et 
al. 
1993). 
Another 
study 
found 
a 
lower 
prevalence 
of 
OSA 
in 
4-to 
5year-
old 
children 
(Ali 
et 
al. 
1993). 
The 
prevalence 
in 
their 
sample 
was 
0.7%. 


A 
recent 
epidiemological 
study 
of 
the 
effects 
of 
ethnicity 
on 
SDB, 
found 
that 
African-American 
(AA) 
subjects 
under 
the 
age 
of 
25 
years 
have 
nearly 
double 
the 
prevalence 
of 
SDB 
(odds 
ratio=1.88) 
as 
compared 
to 
Caucasian 
(C) 
subjects 
(Redline 
et 
al. 
1997). 
These 
data 
suggest 
that 
AA 
children 
may 
be 
at 
increased 
risk 
to 
develop 
SDB. 
Further 
assessment 
of 
this 
risk 
is 
especially 
important 
since 
AA 
have 
already 
been 
shown 
to 
have 
a 
higher 
incidence 
of 
other 
conditions 
associated 
with 
SDB, 
such 
as 
hypertension 
and 
obesity, 
and 
may 
be 
at 
increased 
risk 
for 
morbidity 
associated 
with 
SDB 
(Gillum 
and 
Lio 
1984; 
National 
Center 
for 
Health 
Statistics 
1976). 


A 
possible 
explanation 
for 
underestimating 
the 
prevalence 
of 
SDB 
in 
children 
is 
that 
traditional 
criteria 
used 
for 
scoring 
obstructive 
apneas 
in 
adults 
will 
often 
fail 
to 
identify 
obstructive 
events 
in 
children 
(Rosen 
et 
al. 
1992). 
This 
occurs 
because 
children 
often 
do 
not 
have 
complete 
obstruction 
of 
the 
airway, 
and 
are 
more 
likely 
to 
have 
intermittent 
or 
even 
sustained 
obstructive 
hypopnea. 
The 
term

hypoventilation’ 


.

European

66 
E. 
Stepanski 
et 
al. 


has 
been 
used 
to 
describe 
the 
pattern 
of 
decreased 
SaO2, 
increased 
PETCO2, 
and 
thoraco-abdominal 
paradoxical 
respiration 
seen 
in 
children 
diagnosed 
with 
SDB 
(Rosen 
et 
al. 
1992). 


The 
fact 
that 
polysomnographic 
evidence 
of 
airway 
obstruction 
in 
children 
tends 
to 
be 
more 
subtle 
than 
in 
adults 
seems 
to 
have 
given 
the 
impression 
that 
OSA 
in 
children 
is 
a 
milder 
variant 
of 
adult 
OSA. 
Differences 
in 
the 
pathogenesis 
of 
OSA 
between 
adults 
and 
children 
also 
contribute 
to 
this 
perception. 
Airway 
obstruction 
in 
children, 
as 
opposed 
to 
adults, 
is 
most 
often 
related 
to 
clear 
anatomic 
abnormalities, 
usually 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy. 
This 
can 
lead 
to 
trivializing 
pediatric 
OSA 
as 
a 
consequence 
of 
enlarged 
tonsils 
that 
is 
easily 
remedied 
with 
surgery. 
Although 
adenotonsillar 
surgery 
has 
been 
reported 
to 
eliminate 
OSA 
in 
85% 
of 
children 
(Suen 
et 
al. 
1995), 
there 
are 
data 
showing 
that 
older, 
obese 
children 
are 
less 
likely 
to 
be 
cured 
by 
surgery 
(Stepanski 
et 
al. 
1996). 


The 
present 
study 
was 
designed 
to 
systematically 
evaluate 
the 
clinical 
and 
polysomnographic 
characteristics 
of 
a 
large 
sample 
of 
children 
diagnosed 
with 
SDB 
using 
age-appropriate 
measurement 
of 
upper 
airway 
obstruction. 
These 
data 
were 
compared 
to 
those 
from 
a 
group 
of 
children 
also 
referred 
for 
sleep 
center 
evaluation, 
but 
found 
not 
to 
have 
SDB. 
Additional 
comparisons 
of 
subgroups 
based 
on 
gender 
and 
ethnicity 
are 
presented. 


METHODS 


Subjects 


The 
data 
reported 
below 
are 
from 
a 
series 
of 
198 
consecutive 
pediatric 
and 
adolescent 
patients 
(< 
17 
years 
of 
age) 
referred 
for 
evaluation 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Illinois 
at 
Chicago 
Center 
for 
Sleep 
and 
Ventilatory 
Disorders. 
The 
large 
majority 
of 
these 
patients 
(97%) 
were 
referred 
specificially 
to 
rule 
out 
sleep-disordered 
breathing. 
Each 
evaluation 
included 
a 
clinical 
interview 
and 
one 
night 
of 
polysomnography. 
Two 
children 
were 
excluded 
from 
the 
series 
because 
they 
were 
diagnosed 
with 
limit-setting 
sleep 
disorder 
and 
were 
treated 
behaviorally 
without 
undergoing 
polysomnography. 
Two-thirds 
of 
all 
patients 
were 
referred 
from 
otolaryngology, 
and 
the 
remaining 
children 
were 
referred 
from 
pediatric 
medicine. 


Apparatus 
and 
measurements 


All 
sleep 
studies 
included 
continuous 
monitoring 
of 
central 
and 
occipital 
electroencephalogram 
(EEG), 
right 
and 
left 
electrooculogram, 
submental 
electromyogram, 
ribcage 
and 
abdominal 
respiratory 
effort, 
nasal 
and 
oral 
airflow, 
oxygen 
saturation, 
and 
electrocardiogram. 
Respiratory 
effort 
was 
monitored 
with 
inductance 
plethysmography. 
Oxygen 
saturation 
was 
measured 
using 
pulse 
oximetry 
(Nellcor 
N-200, 
Nellcor, 
Inc., 
N-200, 
Hayward, 
CA, 
USA) 
with 
the 
probe 
attached 
to 
a 
finger, 
or 
in 
some 
children, 
to 
a 
toe. 
All 
oximetry 
data 
were 
collected 
on 
a 
50–100% 
scale. 
Therefore, 
50% 
was 
the 
lowest 
recorded 
value 
even 
though 
the 
oximeter 
may 
have 
showed 
values 
below 
50%. 
These 
channels 
were 
recorded 
simultaneously 
on 
a 
Grass 
Model 


78 
Polygraph 
and/or 
on 
a 
Bio-Logic 
SleepScan 
Console 
(Bio-
Logic, 
Mundelein, 
Illinois, 
USA). 


Obstructive 
apneas 
were 
defined 
as 
absent 
nasal/oral 
airflow 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
respiratory 
effort 
for 
a 
period 
of 
at 
least 
10 
s. 
Obstructive 
hypopnea 
was 
defined 
as 
a 
20% 
or 
greater 
decrease 
in 
airflow 
(but 
not 
absent) 
accompanied 
by 
either 
oxygen 
desaturation 
(> 
1%) 
or 
an 
EEG 
arousal. 
Arousals 
were 
scored 
according 
to 
standard 
criteria 
(Sleep 
Disorders 
Atlas 
Task 
Force, 
American 
Sleep 
Disorders 
Association 
1992). 


All 
polysomnograms 
were 
conducted 
at 
night. 
The 
recording 
time 
was 
set 
at 
8 
h, 
but 
varied 
somewhat 
according 
to 
the 
individual 
needs 
of 
each 
patient. 


A 
diagnosis 
of 
SDB 
was 
made 
after 
review 
of 
the 
clinical, 
polysomnographic, 
and 
taped 
audiovisual 
data. 
This 
diagnosis 
was 
made 
when: 
(1) 
there 
were 
frequent 
([5/h) 
episodes 
of 
upper 
airway 
obstruction, 
and/or 
(2) 
there 
was 
significant 
oxygen 
desaturation 
(< 
90%), 
sleep 
fragmentation, 
or 
cardiac 
arrhythmia 
in 
association 
with 
episodes 
of 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
(even 
though 
the 
obstructive 
episodes 
did 
not 
occur 
at 
a 
rate 
of 
[5/h). 
In 
five 
cases, 
the 
diagnosis 
was 
based 
largely 
on 
the 
audiovisual 
data 
as 
there 
were 
few 
obstructive 
events 
meeting 
polysomnographic 
scoring 
criteria. 
In 
these 
cases, 
the 
videotapes 
confirmed 
obstructive 
events 
characterized 
by 
episodes 
of 
gasping, 
stridor, 
or 
choking 
sounds 
following 
increased 
use 
of 
accessory 
muscles, 
loud 
interrupted 
snoring, 
jaw 
and/or 
sternal 
retractions 
or 
thoracoabdominal 
paradoxic 
respiration. 
These 
events 
were 
clearly 
observed 
on 
the 
audiovisual 
recording, 
even 
though 
the 
airflow 
appeared 
unchanged 
on 
the 
polysomnogram. 
If 
more 
than 
30 
such 
events 
were 
observed 
on 
the 
videotape, 
then 
a 
diagnosis 
of 
SDB 
was 
made. 
The 
AHI 
for 
the 
patients 
diagnosed 
in 
this 
way 
ranged 
from 
1.3 
to 
2.2 
events 
per 
hour 
of 
sleep. 
The 
importance 
of 
audiovisual 
data 
in 
the 
evaluation 
of 
OSA 
in 
children 
has 
been 
previously 
described 
(Brouillette 
et 
al. 
1996). 
All 
diagnoses 
were 
made 
by 
consensus 
of 
two 
board-certified 
sleep 
specialists. 


Data 
analysis 


Since 
data 
were 
not 
normally 
distributed, 
between 
group 
comparisons 
of 
sleep 
and 
respiratory 
parameters 
were 
made 
using 
a 
nonparametric 
test, 
the 
Wilcoxon 
two-sample 
test. 
To 
decrease 
the 
likelihood 
of 
a 
Type 
I 
error 
due 
to 
performing 
multiple 
tests, 
a 
P-value 
of 
0.01 
was 
used 
to 
determine 
statistical 
significance 
for 
these 
tests. 
Chi-squares 
were 
used 
to 
compare 
frequency 
distributions. 
Analysis 
of 
variance 
(ANOVA) 
was 
used 
when 
indicated 
as 
described 
below.

was 


20.3 
(±9.9) 
compared 
to

(±4.5) 
for 
non-SDB 
patients 
(t=2.51, 
P<

However, 
this 
difference 
was 
not 
uniform 
across 
all 
age 
groups.

The

a 
significant

(F[6,141]=3.68,

(F[1,

Relation 
of 
polysomnographic 
data 
to 
race 
and 
gender 


An 
equivalent 
proportion 
of 
each 
ethnic 
group 
was 
diagnosed 
with 
SDB; 
AA: 
65%, 
L: 
62%, 
and 
C: 
68%. 
Obstructive 
event 
indices, 
apnea 
duration, 
and 
oxygen 
saturation 
data 
from 
the 
SDB 
patients 
are 
presented 
according 
to 
race 
and 
gender 
in 
Table 
4. 
Data 
from 
the 
C 
and 
L 
groups 
were 
combined 
as 
they 
were 
not 
different 
from 
each 
other. 
The 
AA 
group 
with 
SDB 
had 
significantly 
lower 
oxygen 
saturation 
values 
in 
association 
with 
obstructive 
events 
compared 
to 
the 
Other 
group. 
In 
addition 
to 
more 
severe 
absolute 
changes 
in 
oxygen 
saturation, 
the 
AA 
patients 
also 
had 
more 
frequent 
desaturations 
to 
below 
90%. 
Apnea 
duration 
in 
NREM 
and 
REM 
sleep 
for 
the 
AA 
group 
was 
14.9 
(±5.5) 
and 
12.6 
(±3.1), 
respectively, 
as 
compared 
to 
14.1 
(±4.3) 
and 
13.2 
(±3.2) 
for 
the 
Other 
group. 
The 
AA 
group 
was 
an 
average 
of 
5.9 
years 
of 
age 
compared 
to 


5.6 
years 
for 
the 
Other 
group. 
The 
average 
BMI 
also 
did 
not 
differ 
between 
groups 
(AA=20.2 
vs. 
20.6). 
Sleep 
architecture 
was 
not 
significantly 
different 
between 
ethnic 
groups. 
Male 
patients 
were 
found 
to 
have 
signficantly 
lower 
values 
for 
oxygen 
saturation 
during 
sleep 
than 
female 
patients 
(Table 
4). 
These 
groups 
were 
not 
significantly 
different 
with 
respect 
to 


BMI 
(male=19.5 
vs. 
21.0), 
age 
(male=5.4 
years 
vs. 
6.2), 
or 
sleep 
architecture. 


Data 
from 
the 
clinical 
history 
showed 
that 
94% 
of 
the 
AASDB 
patients 
reported 
difficulty 
with 
nasal 
breathing 
during 
wakefulness 
compared 
to 
74% 
of 
the 
AA 
patients 
without 
SDB 
(v2=11.25, 
P< 
0.0004). 
This 
percentage 
of 
reported 
difficulty 
with 
nasal 
breathing 
(94%) 
was 
also 
significantly 
greater 
than 
that 
seen 
in 
the 
non-AA 
children 
with 
SDB 
(77%; 
v2=7.98, 
P< 
0.02). 


Other 
polysomnographic 
abnormalities 


Eight 
children 
had 
markedly 
abnormal 
ECGs 
during 
sleep. 
In 
two 
cases 
there 
was 
second 
degree 
A-V 
block, 
and 
in 
six 
cases 
there 
were 
premature 
wide-complex 
beats, 
> 
2 
per 
minute, 
in 
association 
with 
obstructive 
events. 
All 
eight 
of 
these 
children 
were 
from 
the 
group 
diagnosed 
with 
SDB, 
and 
all 
were 
AA. 
The 
severity 
of 
their 
SDB 
as 
measured 
by 
number 
of 
events 
(AHI=17.4 
±7.4) 
or 
their 
duration 
was 
similar 
to 
the 
overall 
group. 
The 
severity 
of 
associated 
oxygen 
desaturation 
in 
this 
subgroup 
was 
not 
different 
from 
the 
other 
AA 
children 
with 
SDB. 
Repeat 
polysomnograms 
were 
obtained 
following 
adenotonsillar 
surgery 
for 
four 
of 
these 
patients. 
Three 
of 
these 
had 
normal 
ECGs, 
and 
the 
remaining 
patient 
continued 
to 
have 
frequent 
premature 
beats. 


Abnormal 
sleep 
EEGs, 
other 
than 
increased 
arousals, 
were 
found 
in 
27 
children. 
Three 
of 
these 
patients 
had 
a 
previously 
diagnosed 
seizure 
disorder 
and 
were 
taking 
phenobarbital 
and 
two 
others 
had 
congenital 
disorders 
associated 
with 
central 
nervous 
system 
dysfunction 
(spina 
bifida, 
cerebral 
palsy). 
Four 
of 
these 
five 
children 
were 
positive 
for 
SDB. 
Of 
the 
remaining 
21 
children, 
12 
showed 
frequent 
sharp 
transients 
and 
periods 
of 
hypersynchronous 
theta 
activity 
not 
corresponding 
to 
respiratory 
events 
or 
other 
evidence 
of 
arousal. 
The 
remaining 
nine 
children 
showed 
these 
same 
abnormalities, 
but 
also 
had 
spike 
and 
wave 
complexes. 
The 
rate 
of 
abnormal 
EEGs 
was 
the 
same 
in 
the 
SDB 
and 
non-SDB 
groups. 


DISCUSSION 


Two-thirds 
of 
the 
children 
referred 
to 
our 
Center 
were 
diagnosed 
with 
SDB. 
Rates 
of 
diagnosed 
SDB 
did 
not 
vary 
according 
to 
age, 
weight, 
gender, 
or 
racial 
group. 
The 
majority 
of 
obstructive 
events 
were 
hypopneas. 
The 
liberal 
definition 
used 
to 
score 
hypopneas 
in 
this 
study 
increased 
the 
number 
of 
scorable 
obstructive 
events 
in 
children, 
and 
may 
have 
provided 
a 
more 
accurate 
measure 
of 
the 
severity 
of 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
in 
this 
population. 
A 
potential 
limitation 
to 
these 
data 
is 
that 
the 
diagnosis 
of 
SDB 
was 
based 
on 
a 
single 
night 
of 
polysomnography. 
Given 
the 
night-to-night 
variability 
in 
SDB, 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
some 
patients 
with 
SDB 
who 
would 
have 
benefited 
from 
treatment 
were 
not 
identified. 


In 
this 
sample, 
rates 
of 
reported 
snoring 
(93%) 
and 
tonsillar 
enlargement 
(90%) 
were 
too 
high 
in 
the 
overall 
group 
for 
these

obesity 
may 
result 
from 
another 
factor. 
Longitudinal 
research 
is 
needed 
to 
address 
this 
question. 


Sleep 
architecture 
was 
preserved 
in 
the 
children 
with 
SDB, 
despite 
increased 
EEG 
arousals. 
This 
is 
consistent 
with 
previous 
research 
reporting 
that 
sleep 
architecture 
is 
unchanged 
in 
children 
despite 
the 
presence 
of 
obstructive 
events 
(McGrath 
et 
al. 
1992). 


More 
frequent 
and 
more 
severe 
oxygen 
desaturation 
was 
found 
by 
pulse 
oximetry 
in 
AA 
children 
with 
SDB 
than 
in 
C 
and 
L 
children 
despite 
an 
otherwise 
similar 
severity 
of 
SDB, 
as 
well 
as 
similar 
BMI 
and 
age. 
The 
degree 
of 
oxygen 
desaturation 
is 
not 
predicted 
by 
awake 
SpO2. 
This 
finding 
does 
not 
appear 
to 
be 
secondary 
to 
a 
methodological 
artifact 
arising 
from 
differences 
in 
skin 
color, 
since 
oxygen 
saturation 
was 
not 
different 
during 
wakefulness. 
Additionally, 
prior 
validity 
studies 
of 
this 
technique 
have 
not 
shown 
systematically 
lower 
values 
in 
AA 
subjects 
(Jubran 
and 
Tobin 
1990). 
In 
fact, 
the 
opposite 
is 
true 
– 
equivalent 
SpO2 
values 
are 
associated 
with 
lower 
PaO2 
in 
black 
patients 
(Jubran 
and 
Tobin 
1990). 
One 
possibility, 
regarding 
the 
greater 
decrease 
in 
oxygen 
saturation 
during 
obstructive 
events, 
is 
that 
there 
is 
a 
difference 
in 
hemoglobin 
(e.g. 
Hgb 
binding 
capacity) 
in 
the 
AA 
children 
such 
that 
they 
desaturate 
more 
precipitously 
with 
obstructive 
events. 
Three 
children 
had 
sickle 
cell 
disease 
based 
on 
medical 
history; 
patients 
undergoing 
sleep 
evaluation 
were 
not 
otherwise 
screened 
for 
sickle 
cell 
disease. 
Differences 
in 
total 
and 
vital 
lung 
capacities 
between 
AA 
and 
C/L 
children, 
despite 
similar 
BMI, 
is 
also 
probable 
(Schoenberg 
et 
al. 
1978). 
This 
same 
pattern 
of 
lower 
oxygen 
desaturation 
with 
obstructive 
events 
has 
recently 
been 
reported 
in 
adult 
AA 
patients 
compared 
to 
L 
and 
non-L 
white 
patients 
(Levenson 
et 
al. 
1997). 
The 
ECG 
abnormalities 
found 
in 
the 
AA 
patients 
suggest 
that 
these 
children 
may 
be 
at 
increased 
risk 
of 
cardiovascular 
consequences 
of 
SDB 
than 
children 
from 
other 
racial 
groups. 
It 
appears 
that 
these 
ECG 
abnormalities 
may 
have 
been 
a 
consequence 
of 
OSA 
since 
ECGs 
tended 
to 
normalize 
following 
successful 
treatment 
of 
SDB 
with 
adenotonsillar 
surgery. 
Abnormal 
EEGs 
were 
not 
associated 
with 
SDB. 


It 
should 
be 
noted 
that 
this 
sample 
of 
AA 
patients 
was 
selected 
through 
referral 
to 
our 
Center, 
and 
therefore 
results 
regarding 
racial 
differences 
may 
not 
generalize 
beyond 
our 
referral 
base. 
Population 
studies 
will 
be 
needed 
to 
address 
this 
possibility. 


Male 
patients 
also 
showed 
lower 
nadirs 
of 
oxygen 
saturation 
following 
obstructive 
events 
compared 
to 
female 
patients. 
These 
groups 
do 
not 
vary 
with 
respect 
to 
BMI, 
and 
it 
is 
unclear 
what 
is 
causing 
these 
differences 
in 
oxygen 
saturation. 
Similar 
differences 
have 
been 
reported 
in 
elderly 
AA 
men 
as 
compared 
to 
AA 
women 
(Ancoli-Israel 
et 
al. 
1997). 


In 
summary, 
a 
large 
percentage 
of 
children 
referred 
for 
evaluation 
of 
suspected 
SDB 
were 
diagnosed 
with 
SDB 
after 
polysomnography. 
Obesity 
emerges 
as 
a 
risk 
factor 
for 
SDB 
in 
children 
8 
years 
of 
age 
and 
older. 
African-American 
children 
displayed 
more 
severe 
oxygen 
desaturation 
with 
obstructive 
events 
than 
other 
children 
with 
the 
same 
frequency 
and 
duration 
of 
obstructive 
events. 
It 
also 
appears 
that 
AA 
children 
may 
be 
at 
increased 
risk 
for 
cardiovascular 
consequences 
of 
SDB.
