Objective To 
analyze 
the 
relationships 
between 
sleep 
duration, 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
syndrome 
(OSAS), 
and 
markers 
of 
insulin 
resistance 
in 
obese 
children. 
Study design Forty 
obese 
children 
were 
evaluated 
for 
sleep-related 
complaints. 
Each 
child 
underwent 
a 
polysomnogram, 
an 
oral 
glucose 
tolerance 
test 
(OGTT), 
and 
fasting 
lipid 
panel 
tests. 
Indices 
of 
insulin 
resistance 
(HOMA-IR 
and 
WBISI) 
and 
insulin 
secretion 
(IGI) 
were 
calculated 
based 
on 
the 
results 
of 
the 
OGTT. 
Markers 
of 
insulin 
resistance 
were 
compared 
among 
groups 
categorized 
according 
to 
polysomnogram 
results. 
Results Subjects 
with 
shorter 
sleep 
duration 
had 
higher 
fasting 
insulin, 
peak 
insulin, 
and 
HOMA-IR 
levels 
and 
lower 
WBISI 
levels, 
findings 
suggestive 
of 
insulin 
resistance. 
In 
contrast, 
differences 
in 
body 
mass 
index 
z 
scores 
were 
not 
observed. 
Subjects 
with 
OSAS 
(32 
of 
40 
children) 
had 
higher 
triglyceride 
levels 
and 
HOMA-IR 
values 
than 
those 
without 
OSAS, 
but 
did 
not 
differ 
in 
sleep 
duration. 
Multiple 
linear 
regression 
analysis 
revealed 
that 
HOMA-IR 
was 
significantly 
correlated 
with 
age, 
sleep 
duration, 
and 
percentage 
of 
rapid-eye-movement 
sleep. 
Conclusions Insulin 
resistance 
in 
obese 
children 
is 
associated 
with 
short 
sleep 
duration 
and 
OSAS.

placing 
adults 
and 
children 
at 
risk 
for 
the 
metabolic 
syndrome, 
obesity 
is 
also 
a 
significant 
risk 
factor 
for 
sleep 
abnormalities. 
Several 
epidemiologic 
studies 
have 
found 
short 
sleep 
duration 
to 
be 
closely 
linked 
to 
obesity 
in 
subjects 
of 
all 
ages. 
In 
a 
case-control 
study 
of 
5-year-old 
children 
in 
France, 
short 
sleep 
duration 
was 
found 
to 
be 
associated 
with 
increased 
risk 
of 
obesity, 
even 
after 
controlling 
for 
television 
watching 
and 
parental 
overweight.1 
Gupta 
et 
al2 
described 
a 
link 
between 
obesity 
and 
sleep 
duration 
in 
a 
cohort 
of 
adolescents, 
noting 
that 
for 
each 
hour 
of 
sleep 
lost, 
the 
odds 
of 
being 
obese 
increased 
by 
80%. 
A 
13-year 
prospective 
study 
found 
a 
negative 
correlation 
between 
sleep 
duration 
and 
obesity 
in 
young 
adults 
even 
after 
controlling 
for 
a 
number 
of 
factors, 
including 
family 
history 
of 
overweight 
and 
levels 
of 
physical 
activity.3 


In 
addition, 
short 
sleep 
duration 
has 
been 
associated 
with 
insulin 
resistance 
and 
impaired 
glucose 
metabolism 
in 
healthy 
adult 
volunteers. 
Several 
studies 
have 
demonstrated 
an 
association 
between 
habitual 
short 
sleep 
duration 
and 
subsequent 
risk 
of 
developing 
type 
2 
diabetes 
mellitus 
in 
adults.4-8 
However, 
to 
the 
best 
of 
our 
knowledge, 
no 
studies 
to 
date 
have 
evaluated 
the 
relationship 
among 
sleep 
duration, 
insulin 
resistance, 
and 
glucose 
metabolism 
in 
children. 


In 
adults, 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
syndrome 
(OSAS), 
independent 
of 
obesity, 
is 
associated 
with 
insulin 
resistance 
and 
the 
metabolic 
syndrome. 
Shinohara 
et 
al9 
found 
that 
visceral 
fat 
accumulation 
(a 
marker 
of 
insulin 
resistance) 
rather 
than 
subcutaneous 
adiposity 
is 
most 
strongly 
associated 
with 
OSAS. 
Prospective 
epidemiologic 
studies 
have 
also 


See editorial, p 331 

shown 
that 
adults 
who 
snore 
are 
more 
likely 
to 
develop 
type 
2 
diabetes 
mellitus 
and 
cardiovascular 
morbidities.10,11

addition, 
sleep 
apnea 
is 
more 
common 
in

METHODS 

We 
reviewed 
the 
outpatient 
charts 
of 
40 
obese 
children 
(body 
mass 
index 
[BMI] 
. 
95th 
percentile 
for 
age 
and 
sex) 
who 
had 
been 
followed 
in 
the 
Weight 
Management 
Center 
of 
the 
Section 
of 
Endocrinology 
and 
Diabetes 
at 
St 
Christopher’s 
Hospital 
for 
Children. 
Charts 
were 
included 
for 
review 
if 
patients 
were 
obese, 
had 
completed 
an 
oral 
glucose 
tolerance 
test 
(OGTT) 
and 
a 
fasting 
lipid 
panel, 
and, 
because 
of 
sleep-related 
complaints, 
had 
completed 
an 
overnight 
multichannel 
polysomnogram 
at 
the 
Sleep 
Center 
at 
St 
Christopher’s 
Hospital 
for 
Children. 
Sleep-related 
complaints 
included 
snoring, 
excessive 
daytime 
sleepiness, 
and 
nonrestful 
sleep. 
A 
chart 
was 
not 
included 
in 
the 
review 
if 
the 
patient 
had 
any 
neuromuscular 
or 
craniofacial 
abnormality 
affecting 
the 
airway 
or 
was 
taking 
a 
sedative 
or 
noninhaled 
steroid 
medication 
up 
to 
4 
weeks 
before 
the 
polysomnogram. 
Patients 
with 
diabetes 
mellitus 
(fasting 
blood 
glucose 
. 
126 
mg/dL 
or 
2-hour 
blood 
glucose 
in 
the 
OGTT 
. 
200 
mg/dL) 
were 
excluded 
from 
the 
study. 
This 
study 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
St 
Christopher’s 
Hospital 
for 
Children 
Institutional 
Review 
Board. 


As 
part 
of 
the 
evaluation 
at 
the 
Weight 
Management 
Center, 
body 
weight 
in 
light 
clothing 
was 
recorded 
to 
the 
nearest 
0.1 
kg 
using 
a 
digital 
scale, 
and 
height 
was 
measured 
to 
the 
nearest 
0.1 
cm 
using 
a 
wall-mounted 
stadiometer. 
BMI 
was 
calculated 
according 
to 
the 
standard 
formula 
(weight 
[kg] 


. 
height 
[m]2). 
BMI 
z 
scores 
were 
computed 
using 
national 
standards 
for 
age 
and 
sex. 
Tanner 
staging 
was 
determined 
by 
physical 
examination. 
For 
the 
purposes 
of 
the 
chart 
review, 
height 
and 
weight 
measurements 
and 
Tanner 
staging 
closest 
to 
the 
date 
of 
the 
overnight 
multichannel 
polysomnogram 
were 
included 
in 
the 
study. 
The 
following 
variables 
were 
measured 
during 
the 
overnight 
multichannel 
polysomnogram: 
total 
time 
in 
bed, 
total 
sleep 
time, 
sleep 
latency, 
sleep 
efficiency, 
percent 
time 
spent 
in 
each 
sleep 
stage, 
time 
spent 
snoring 
(snore 
microphone), 
oxygen 
saturation, 
end-tidal 
CO2, 
nasal 
airflow, 
and 
thoracic/ 
abdominal 
motion. 
During 
the 
chart 
review, 
the 
following 
variables 
were 
recorded: 
duration 
of 
sleep; 
sleep 
efficiency; 
apnea/hypopnea 
index 
(AHI), 
defined 
as 
the 
average 
number 
of 
episodes 
of 
apnea 
and 
hypopnea 
per 
hour 
of 
sleep; 
minimum 
oxygen 
saturation; 
peak 
end-tidal 
CO2; 
percent 
time 
spent 
in 
rapid-eye-movement 
(REM) 
sleep; 
and 
percent 
time 
spent 
in 
slow-wave 
sleep 
(SWS). 
OSAS 
was 
defined 
as 
an 
AHI 
. 
1.5 
events 
per 
hour, 
or 
a 
minimum 
oxygen 
saturation 


92%.13 
All 
polysomnograms 
were 
interpreted 
by 
one 
of 
the 
authors 
(SK), 
who 
was 
unaware 
of 
the 
subjects’ 
laboratory 
results. 
To 
complete 
the 
OGTT, 
after 
fasting 
overnight, 
insulin 
and 
glucose 
levels 
were 
drawn 
before 
the 
ingestion 
of 
1.75 
g/kg 
body 
weight 
(up 
to 
a 
maximum 
of 
75 
g) 
of 
glucola. 
Insulin 
and 
glucose 
levels 
were 
drawn 
at 
30, 
60, 
90, 
and 
120 
minutes 
after 
ingestion. 
The 
glucose 
values 
from 
the 
OGTT 
were 
used 
to 
identify 
patients 
with 
impaired 
glucose 
tolerance 
(glucose 
at 
120 
minutes 
. 
140 
mg/dL 
but 
. 
200 
mg/dL) 
or 
diabetes 
mellitus 
(fasting 
glucose 
. 
126 
mg/dL 
or 
glucose 
at 


120 
minutes 
. 
200 
mg/dL), 
as 
defined 
by 
the 
American 
Diabetes 
Association.14 
In 
addition, 
all 
patients 
underwent 
a 
fasting 
lipid 
panel. 


The 
results 
of 
the 
OGTT 
were 
used 
to 
assess 
insulin 
resistance 
and 
insulin 
secretion. 
To 
assess 
insulin 
resistance, 
two 
indices—Homeostasis 
Model 
Assessment 
of 
Insulin 
Resistance 
(HOMA-IR) 
and 
Whole-Body 
Insulin 
Sensitivity 
Index 
(WBISI)—were 
calculated 
using 
the 
results 
of 
the 
OGTT. 
The 
HOMA-IR 
was 
calculated 
by 
multiplying 
fasting 
glucose 
(mmol/L) 
by 
fasting 
insulin 
(U/mL), 
then 
dividing 
this 
value 
by 
22.5. 
The 
WBISI 
was 
calculated 
as 
follows: 


10, 
000 


. 


(fasting 
glucose 
. 
fasting 
insulin)(mean 
glucose 
. 
mean 
insulin) 


The 
index 
of 
insulin 
secretion, 
the 
insulinogenic 
index 
(IGI) 
was 
calculated 
by 
dividing 
the 
. 
insulin 
(0 
to 
30 
minutes) 
by 
the 
. 
glucose 
(0 
to 
30 
minutes). 


Based 
on 
the 
results 
of 
the 
polysomnogram, 
subjects 
were 
first 
divided 
into 
2 
groups 
according 
to 
sleep 
duration 
(. 
6 
hours 
and 
. 
6 
hours), 
and 
age, 
BMI 
z 
score, 
measures 
of 
insulin 
resistance, 
insulin 
secretion, 
glucose 
tolerance, 
and 
lipid 
levels 
were 
compared. 
The 
sleep 
duration 
of 
6 
hours 
was 
chosen 
as 
the 
separation 
point 
because 
this 
value 
is 
outside 
of 
the 
normal 
distribution 
of 
sleep 
duration, 
even 
for 
older 
adolescents.15 
Patients 
were 
also 
divided 
into 
2 
groups 
according 
to 
the 
presence 
or 
absence 
of 
OSAS, 
and 
the 
same 
variables 
compared. 
To 
determine 
whether 
pubertal 
status 
acted 
as 
a 
confounding 
factor, 
subjects 
were 
stratified 
according 
to 
Tanner 
stage, 
and 
sleep 
time 
and 
AHI 
index 
were 
compared. 
Using 
the 
backward-stepwise 
method, 
multiple 
linear 
regression 
analysis 
was 
applied 
to 
model 
the 
significant 
predictors 
of 
HOMA-IR. 
Age 
and 
BMI 
z 
scores 
were 
included 
in 
the 
regression 
model 
because 
of 
their 
potential 
confounding 
effects. 
IGI 
and 
AHI 
were 
log-transformed 
before 
the 
analysis 
to 
achieve 
normal 
distributions. 


Patient 
characteristics, 
laboratory 
results, 
and 
polysomnogram 
results 
were 
compared 
using 
unpaired 
Student’s 
t 
tests 
or 
analysis 
of 
variance. 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov 
tests 
were 
used 
to 
assess 
normality 
of 
distribution. 
Variables 
with 
a 
nonnormal 
distribution 
were 
log-transformed 
before 
analysis. 
Linear 
regression 
models 
were 
developed 
using 
the 
backward-
stepwise 
method. 
Statistical 
calculations 
were 
performed 
using 
SPSS 
for 
Windows, 
version 
13.0 
(SPSS 
Inc, 
Chicago, 
IL). 
All 
tests 
were 
2-tailed, 
and 
P 
values 
. 
.05 
were 
considered 
statistically 
significant. 


RESULTS 

The 
charts 
of 
40 
obese 
children 
were 
reviewed 
(20 
males; 
age 
range, 
3.5 
to 
18.5 
years; 
mean 
age, 
12.3

The 
mean 
total

measured 
was 
373.4

Fourteen

in 
this 
analysis. 
When 
we

Of

DISCUSSION 

Sleep 
loss 
is 
becoming 
increasingly 
prevalent 
in 
both 
adults 
and 
in 
children. 
The 
decline 
in 
sleep 
duration 
has 
paralleled 
a 
dramatic 
increase 
in 
the 
prevalence 
of 
obesity 
and 
diabetes. 
Recent 
data 
suggest 
that 
these 
two 
epidemics 
may 
have 
a 
mechanistic 
relationship. 
Our 
findings 
indicate 
a 
link 
between 
decreased 
sleep 
duration 
and 
increased 
insulin 
resistance 
in 
obese 
children. 
Children 
with 
short 
sleep 
duration 
have 
greater 
insulin 
resistance 
than 
children 
with 
normal 
sleep 
duration. 
In 
addition, 
they 
spend 
proportionally 
less 
time 
in 
REM 
sleep. 
Of 
note, 
studies 
conducted 
in 
normal 
subjects 
have 
demonstrated 
that 
glucose 
utilization 
during 
REM 
sleep 
is 
higher 
than 
during 
non-REM 
sleep,16,17 
thus 
suggesting 
decreased 
glucose 
utilization 
(ie, 
increased 
insulin 
resistance) 
in 
the 
subset 
of 
our 
patient 
population 
with 
short 
sleep 
duration. 


In 
addition, 
our 
findings 
indicate 
that 
the 
association 
between 
sleep 
duration 
and 
insulin 
resistance 
is 
not 
due 
to 
potential 
confounding 
factors 
such 
as 
puberty 
or 
obesity. 
After 
stratifying 
the 
data 
by 
Tanner 
stage, 
we 
found 
no 
association 
between 
pubertal 
status 
and 
sleep 
duration. 
Multiple 
linear 
regression 
analysis 
demonstrated 
that 
age 
was 
a 
significant 
independent 
predictor 
of 
insulin 
resistance, 
but 
adiposity 
was 
not. 


Although 
there 
have 
been 
no 
previous 
studies 
of 
the 
relationship 
between 
sleep 
duration 
and 
insulin 
resistance 
in 
children, 
our 
results 
are 
consistent 
with 
similar 
studies 
conducted 
in 
the 
adult 
population. 
Two 
controlled 
studies 
in 
healthy 
young 
men 
submitted 
to 
acute 
sleep 
reduction 
demonstrated 
increased 
insulin 
resistance 
and 
decreased 
glucose 
tolerance 
and 
insulin 
release.18,19 
Of 
note, 
when 
sleep 
reduction 
is 
chronic 
(at 
least 
6 
months), 
glucose 
tolerance 
tends 
to 
normalize 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
significantly 
higher 
insulin 
secretion, 
suggesting 
the 
development 
of 
insulin 
resistance. 
It 
has 
also 
been 
found 
that 
adults 
reporting 
short 
sleep 
duration 
are 
more 
likely 
to 
develop 
diabetes.4-8 
In 
one 
study, 
more 
than 
8000 
men 
with 
difficulty 
maintaining 
sleep 
were 
at 
higher 
risk 
of 
developing 
type 
2 
diabetes 
mellitus 
after 
controlling 
for 
family 
history 
of 
diabetes 
and 
BMI.8 
Another, 
more 
recent 
study 
found 
that 
men 
reporting 
short 
sleep 
duration 
(. 
5to 
6 
hours 
of 
sleep 
per 
night) 
were 
twice 
as 
likely 
to 
develop 
diabetes.7 


Our 
findings 
concur 
with 
those 
of 
de 
la 
Eva 
et 
al,20 
who, 
in 
a 
cross-sectional 
study 
of 
a 
cohort 
of 
obese 
children 
with 
sleep-related 
complaints, 
found 
an 
independent 
association 
of 
the 
severity 
of 
OSAS 
with 
fasting 
insulin 
levels, 
even 
after 
accounting 
for 
age 
and 
BMI.

studied 
a 
group 
of 
obese 
and 
nonobese 
pediatric 
patients 
referred 
for 
evaluation 
of 
sleep 
complaints 
and 
found 
that 
obesity 
rather 
than 
severity 
of 
sleep 
apnea 
was 
the 
major 
determinant 
of 
insulin 
resistance 
and 
dyslipidemia. 
The 
opposing 
results 
may 
be 
due 
in 
part 
to 
differences 
in 
the 
respective 
populations 
studied. 
Both 
obese 
and 
nonobese 
children 
were 
included 
in 
Tauman 
et 
al’s 
study 
population. 
In 
addition, 
the 
mean 
age 
of 
Tauman’s 
study 
population 
was 
3 
years 
younger 
than 
the 
mean 
age 
of 
our 
population 
and 
2 
years 
younger 
than 
the 
mean 
age 
of 
subjects 
studied 
by 
de 
la 
Eva 
et 
al.20 
We 
postulate 
that 
these 
conflicting 
results 
may 
have 
arisen 
because 
in 
older 
children, 
insulin 
resistance 
and 
sleep 
abnormalities 
may 
have 
existed 
for 
a 
longer 
time, 
thus 
strengthening 
their 
association. 


A 
number 
of 
biological 
mechanisms 
have 
been 
thought 
to 
link 
sleep 
abnormalities 
and 
insulin 
resistance. 
Sleep 
deprivation 
leads 
to 
increased 
secretion 
of 
cortisol 
and 
growth 
hormone, 
two 
counterregulatory 
hormones 
predisposing 
to 
insulin 
resistance.22 
In 
addition, 
sleep 
reduction 
results 
in 
an 
increased 
sympathetic 
tone, 
which 
inhibits 
pancreatic 
-cell 
function 
and 
insulin 
secretion.23 


Another 
possible 
mechanistic 
link 
between 
inadequate 
sleep 
and 
insulin 
resistance 
may 
involve 
the 
effects 
of 
cytokines. 
In 
individuals 
with 
insulin 
resistance, 
the 
serum 
levels 
of 
proinflammatory 
cytokines, 
such 
as 
tumor 
necrosis 
factor 
(TNF)-. 
and 
interleukin 
(IL)-6, 
are 
increased.24 
Experimental 
evidence 
also 
indicates 
that 
TNF-. 
and 
IL-6 
can 
cause 
insulin 
resistance.25-29 
Interestingly, 
several 
studies 
have 
demonstrated 
that 
patients 
with 
OSAS 
have 
elevated 
plasma 


concentrations 
of 
these 
two 
inflammatory 
mediators.30-33 
In 
addition, 
one 
study 
reported 
increased 
TNF-. 
and 
IL-6 
levels 
after 
mild 
(2 
hour) 
sleep 
curtailment.34 
Vgontzas 
et 
al35 
have 
shown 
that 
injections 
of 
etanercept 
(a 
TNF-	–neutralizing 
antibody) 
in 
patients 
with 
OSAS 
results 
in 
decreased 
AHI, 
suggesting 
a 
causative 
role 
for 
TNF-	. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
two 
other 
studies 
have 
described 
a 
reduction 
of 
TNF-. 
plasma 
levels 
in 
patients 
with 
OSAS 
treated 
with 
continuous 
positive 
airway 
pressure 
(CPAP) 
for 
4 
to 
6 
weeks.36,37 


It 
remains 
unclear 
whether 
inadequate 
sleep 
or 
insulin 
resistance 
is 
the 
primary 
pathological 
process. 
The 
increased 
prevalence 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
in 
subjects 
with 
polycystic 
ovary 
syndrome 
(a 
condition 
in 
which 
insulin 
resistance 
is 
a 
primary 
abnormality) 
suggests 
that 
insulin 
resistance 
is 
the 
underlying 
causative 
mechanism 
of 
OSAS.12 
Conversely, 
although 
two 
studies 
have 
demonstrated 
that 
CPAP 
treatment 
improves 
insulin 
resistance,36,37 
implying 
that 
OSAS 
is 
the 
underlying 
pathological 
process, 
two 
other 
studies 
were 
unable 
to 
replicate 
those 
results.38,39 


Our 
study 
has 
three 
main 
limitations. 
First, 
as 
in 
all 
cross-sectional 
studies, 
the 
direction 
of 
causation 
cannot 
be 
inferred 
from 
our 
findings. 
Although 
we 
cannot 
determine 
whether 
insulin 
resistance 
may 
worsen 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
or 
vice 
versa, 
a 
recent 
article 
by 
Vgontzas 
et 
al11 
described 
a 
“bi-directional, 
feed-forward, 
pernicious 
association” 
between 
sleep 
apnea 
and 
insulin 
resistance 
in 
the 
adult 
population. 
Larger, 
longitudinal 
studies 
are 
needed 
to 
determine 
whether 
the 
same 
is 
true 
in 
obese 
pediatric 
populations. 
In 
addition, 
it 
is 
well 
known 
that 
several 
factors 
affect 
the 
development 
of

including

For 
example, 
in 
adults, 
visceral 
adiposity 
is 
associated 
with 
more 
severe 
obstructive

Our 
study 
is 
limited 
in 
our 
ability 
to 
assess 
these 
confounding 
factors, 
because 
information 
on 
exercise 
duration 
or 
distribution 
of 
body 
fat 
was 
not 
collected. 
Finally, 
our 
study 
may 
be 
subject 
to 
selection 
bias. 
In 
fact, 
the 
subjects 
included 
in 
our 
study 
were 
selected 
based 
on 
their 
history 
of 
snoring

other

and 
were 
not

among 
all 
of 
the 
children 
followed 
at 
our 
Weight

Despite 
these

however,

findings 
demonstrate 
a 
clear 
association 
between 
inadequate 
sleep

OSAS, 
and

in 
obese

independent

a

our 
findings 
and 
to

the
