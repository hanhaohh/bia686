ABSTRACT. Objectives. This study examined the hypothesis 
that domains of neurobehavioral function 
would be selectively affected by sleep-disordered breathing 
(SDB). Therefore, we assessed potential relationships 
between objectively measured sleep disturbances and 
neurobehavioral function in children with reported 
symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder 
(ADHD) and also determined the incidence of snoring 
and other sleep problems in 5-to 7-year-old children in 
the local community and potential relationships to parental 
snoring and passive smoking. 

Methods. Parents of 5-to 7-year-old children in public 
schools were surveyed about their child’s sleeping 
habits using a validated questionnaire. The questionnaire 
also asked whether they believed their child to be 
hyperactive or have ADHD. Children with reported 
symptoms of ADHD and control children were randomly 
selected and invited to the Sleep Medicine Center for an 
overnight polysomnographic assessment and a battery of 
neurocognitive tests. 

Results. The questionnaire response rate was 47.6% 
(n . 
5728). Frequent and loud snoring was reported for 
673 children (11.7%). Similarly, 418 (7.3%) children were 
reported to have hyperactivity/ADHD, 313 (76.5%) of 
which were boys. Eighty-three children with parentally 
reported symptoms of ADHD were invited for full evaluation 
at the Sleep Medicine Center together with 34 
control children. After assessment with the Conners’ Parent 
Rating Scale, 44 children were designated as having 
“significant” symptoms of ADHD, 27 as “mild,” and 39 
designated as “none” (controls). Overnight polysomnography 
indicated that obstructive sleep apnea was present 
in 5% of those with significant ADHD symptoms, 26% of 
those with mild symptoms, and 5% of those with no 
symptoms. In the cohort, no sleep variable accounted for 
more than a negligible proportion of the variance in 
domains of neurobehavioral function. 

Conclusions. An unusually high prevalence of snoring 
was identified among a group of children designated 
as showing mild symptoms of ADHD based on the Conners’ 
ADHD index identified from a community sample. 
However, whereas SDB is not more likely to occur among

children with significant ADHD symptoms, it is significantly 
highly prevalent among children with mild hyperactive 
behaviors. Sleep studies further revealed that 
rapid eye movement disturbances are more likely to occur 
in children with significant symptoms, and they seem 
to impose significant but mild effects on daytime neurobehavioral 
functioning. We conclude that in children 
with significant symptoms of ADHD, the prevalence of 
SDB is not different from that of the general pediatric 
population and that rapid eye movement sleep in these 
children is disturbed and may contribute to the severity 
of their behavioral manifestations. Furthermore, SDB can 
lead to mild ADHD-like behaviors that can be readily 
misperceived and potentially delay the diagnosis and 
appropriate treatment. Pediatrics 2003;111:554–563; snoring,

A
ttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) 
is the most frequently encountered pediatric 
neurodevelopmental disorder and is characterized 
by inattention, overactivity, and impulsivity.1 
ADHD is estimated to affect between 3% and 5% of 
school-aged children in the United States and Europe,
2–4 although prevalence rates may vary depending 
on whether samples are obtained from community 
or clinical settings.5,6 Symptoms frequently 
coincide with other emotional, behavioral, and learning 
problems, and although the cause of ADHD 
remains unknown, multiple contributors to this condition 
have been identified, such as polygenic influences 
and dopaminergic, adrenergic, and glutamatergic 
alterations in specific brain regions.7 The 
problem behaviors identified in ADHD are thought 
to result from a lack of behavioral inhibition, which 
interferes with 4 executive functions, namely working 
memory, self-regulation of affect/arousal, internalization 
of speech, and reconstitution.8 

There is increasing evidence that snoring and 
sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) are associated with 
behavioral problems, in particular with hyperactivity

and ADHD.9 13 Hyperactive and inattentive behavior 
has been reported in children with obstructive 
sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome14,15 and habitual snoring,
16,17 and it has been further suggested that up to 
one third of all children with frequent, loud snoring 
or SDB will display significant hyperactivity and 
inattention.9 Improvement in the latter hyperactive 
and inattentive behaviors has been found in children 
who have undergone adenotonsillectomy for SDB.13 
Conversely, children with ADHD seem to exhibit 
more sleep disturbances than normal children.18 
However, most of the studies on sleep and ADHD 
have relied on parental reports of sleep disturbance, 
with only a few studies actually performing objective 

–

sleep assessments.1922 The findings of most of the 
latter studies are difficult to interpret because of 
methodological problems such as small sample sizes, 
associated comorbidities, and the lack of adequate 
controls. Although improvement in behavior has 
been noted after treatment of SDB, few studies have 
specifically investigated the relationship between 
SDB and neurobehavioral function. 

To resolve some of these issues, we conducted this 
study to examine potential relationships between 
sleep measures and neurobehavioral function in a 
community cohort of 5-to 7-year-old children with 
reported symptoms of ADHD. Because we used both 
questionnaire data and polysomnography, we were 
in a unique position to compare both subjective and 
objective information in this group of children. Furthermore, 
we wished to determine the incidence of 
snoring and sleep problems in these children and 
assess the relationship with parental snoring and 
parental smoking. 

METHODS 

Survey Questionnaire 

The study was approved by the University of Louisville 
Human Research Committee and the Jefferson 
County Public Schools Board. A previously validated 
questionnaire was used23 (Appendix 1), and a scannable 
version was prepared using Teleform software 
(Cardiff Software, San Marcos, CA). Parents of all 
children who were enrolling in the first grade of the 
Jefferson County Public Schools system were invited 
to complete a detailed questionnaire about their 
child’s sleeping habits. In addition to demographic 
information and significant medical history of the 
child, questions were included on whether the child 
had difficulty initiating sleep, restless sleep, enuresis, 
apnea, cyanosis during sleep, and snoring and, if so, 
the severity of the snoring. The responses were 
graded as “never,”“rarely”(once per week), “occasionally”(
twice per week), “frequently”(3–4 times 
per week), and “almost always” (4 times per 
week). Questions were also included on whether the 
parents considered the child to be hyperactive and 
whether the parents believed that the child had 
ADHD. In addition, parents answered questions regarding 
their own smoking habits and whether they 
snored. 

Subject Selection 

Returned questionnaires were scanned into a computerized 
database using Microsoft Access (Redmond, 
WA). Questionnaires of children whose parents 
believed that they were hyperactive (with or 
without a diagnosis of ADHD) were identified, and 
the parents were contacted without any preferential 
order and invited to the Sleep Medicine Center for an 
overnight polysomnographic assessment and a battery 
of neurobehavioral tests. Children were considered 
eligible as controls provided that they had no 
reports of hyperactivity and either did not snore or 
snored rarely. These questionnaires were identified, 
and parents were contacted in the same manner as 
the other children. Children were not contacted 
when the questionnaires reported other psychiatric 
diagnoses, any chronic medical conditions, or genetic 
or craniofacial syndromes. Children were retrospectively 
excluded when during the later phases of the 
study specific questioning would reveal the presence 
of any exclusionary criteria. 

Measures 

Polysomnographic Assessment 

Parental informed consent and child assent, in the 
presence of a parent, were obtained. A standard 
overnight multichannel polysomnographic evaluation 
was performed at the Sleep Medicine Center of 
Kosair Children’s Hospital. Children were studied 
for up to 12 hours in a quiet, darkened room with an 
ambient temperature of 24°C in the company of 1 of 
their parents. No drugs were used to induce sleep. 
There was no adaptation night, and children were 
requested to be in bed with lights out occurring 
between 21:00 and 21:30 hours. All studies were terminated 
when the children woke up for the day or at 
approximately 7 AM if they were still sleeping, regardless 
of whether the studies were performed on a 
school night or a weekend. The following parameters 
were measured: chest and abdominal wall movement 
by respiratory impedance or inductance plethysmography; 
heart rate by electrocardiogram; and 
air flow by a sidestream end-tidal capnograph, 
which also provided breath-by-breath assessment of 
end-tidal carbon dioxide levels (BCI SC-300, Menomonee 
Falls, WI), and/or a thermistor. Arterial oxygen 
saturation was assessed by pulse oximetry (Spo2; 
Nellcor N 100; Nellcor Inc, Hayward, CA), with simultaneous 
recording of the pulse wave form. The 
bilateral electro-oculogram, 8 channels of electroencephalogram, 
chin and anterior tibial electromyograms, 
and analog output from a body position sensor 
(Braebon Medical Corporation, Ogdensburg, NY) 
were also monitored. All measures were digitized 
using a commercially available polysomnography 
system (Stellate Systems, Montreal, Canada). Tracheal 
sound was monitored with a microphone sensor 
(Sleepmate, Midlothian, VA), and a digital time-
synchronized video recording was performed. 

Sleep Variables 

Sleep architecture was assessed by standard techniques.
24 Arousals were defined as recommended by

the American Sleep Disorders Association Task 
Force report25 and include respiratory-related (occurring 
immediately after an apnea, hypopnea, or 
snore), technician-induced, and spontaneous arousals. 
Arousals were expressed as the total number of 
arousals per hour of sleep time (arousal index). The 
apnea index was defined as the number of apneas 
per hour of total sleep time (TST). Hypopneas were 
defined as a decrease in nasal flow of 50% with a 
corresponding decrease in Spo2 of 4% and/or 
arousal.26 The apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) was defined 
as the number of apneas and hypopneas per 
hour of TST. Spo2, together with Spo2 nadir, was 
determined. The mean and peak end-tidal carbon 
dioxide tension was determined. Central, obstructive, 
and mixed apneic events were counted. Obstructive 
apnea was defined as the absence of airflow 
with continued chest wall and abdominal movement 
for a duration of at least 2 breaths.26,27 Periodic limb 
movements (PLM) during sleep were scored when 
there were at least 4 movements of 0.5 to 5 seconds 
duration and between 5 and 90 seconds apart. A 
PLM index of 5 per hour of sleep is generally 
considered to be rare in normal children.28 For evaluating 
the number of children with objectively measured 
sleep disturbances, the number of children 
with a sleep efficiency 70%, PLM index 10, AHI 
5, or arousal index 20 was determined. The 
threshold values for these indices were selected as 
representing 3 standard deviations (SD) from normative 
values obtained in a large cohort of normal 
children and represent well-accepted criteria for the 
presence of disease. 

Neurobehavioral Assessments 

A battery of neurobehavioral tests was administered 
the morning after polysomnographic assessment. 
These tests comprised the Conners’ Parent 
Rating Scale,29 the Child Behavior Checklist,30 the 
Differential Ability Scales,31 and the NEPSY.32 For 
dividing the children into groups, the ADHD index 
of the Conners’ Parent Rating Scale was used. Children 
were classified as having significant ADHD 
symptoms when their scores were 2 SD above the 
mean (ie, 70). When scores were between 1 and 2 
SD above the mean (ie, 61–69), children were assigned 
to the “mild” group, and children whose 
scores were 60 were included in the control group. 
Children who were reported as having ADHD or 
hyperactivity by their parents but scored 60 on the 
Conners’ Parent Rating Scale were included in the 
control group. 

Behavioral Variables 

The Conners’ Parent Rating Scale29 is used to identify 
behavioral problems in children. The 48-item 
version was used, which yields 7 factors: oppositional, 
cognitive problems/inattention, hyperactivity, 
anxious-shy, perfectionism, social problems, and 
psychosomatic, several summary indices, all with a 
mean score of 50 and an SD of 10. Although not a 
diagnostic tool for ADHD, the ADHD index of this 
rating scale is well validated and a score of 2 SD 

above the mean provides a recognized measure of 
children who are at risk for a diagnosis of ADHD.6,33 

The Child Behavior Checklist30 is the most well-
developed, empirically derived behavior rating scale 
available for assessing psychopathology and social 
competence in children.5 This questionnaire yields 8 
factors: withdrawn, somatic complaints, anxious/depressed, 
social problems, thought problems, attention-
hyperactive, delinquent behavior, and aggressive 
behavior with a mean T score of 50 and an SD 
of 10. 

Neurocognitive Variables 

The Differential Ability Scales (DAS)31 is a battery 
of cognitive tests designed to measure reasoning and 
conceptual ability. Individual DAS subtests are designed 
to measure separate and distinct areas of 
cognitive functioning and thus have high specificity. 
The ability score for a subtest is expressed as a T 
score with a mean of 50 and an SD of 10. The sum of 
the core subtest T scores is converted to a total standard 
score, with a mean of 100 and an SD of 15. The 
NEPSY,32 which abbreviates the word “NEuroPSYchology,” 
is a relatively new neurobehavioral test 
battery and was designed to assess neurobiological 
development in 5 functional domains: attention/executive 
functions, language, sensorimotor functions, 
visuospatial processing, and memory and learning 
with a mean score of 100 and an SD of 15. 

Data Analysis 

Data are presented as means . 
SD unless otherwise 
indicated. For questionnaire-derived responses, 
descriptive statistics and odds ratios (ORs) were calculated 
to assess relationships between snoring in 
children with snoring and smoking in their parents. 
Comparisons of the distribution of demographic and 
risk factors according to group membership (index 
or control) were made with unpaired t tests (continuous 
variables) with P values adjusted for unequal 
variances when appropriate or 2 analyses (dichotomous 
outcomes). Analysis of variance was used 
for comparisons of polysomnographic and neurocognitive 
variables. Multiple regression and logistic 
regression were performed to evaluate potential relationships 
between sleep measures and neurobehavioral 
scores for the study groups. All P values 
reported are 2-tailed with statistical significance set 
at .05. 

RESULTS 

Large-Scale Questionnaire 

Of the 11 983 questionnaires mailed, 372 were returned 
because of a wrong address, insufficient address, 
or no forwarding address. Thus, 11 611 potential 
responders were available. From the mailing 
alone, 4322 completed questionnaires were received. 
With an additional telephone call, 1890 households 
were reached and 1406 either completed the questionnaire 
on the telephone or mailed the filled-out 
questionnaire. Because the distribution of findings 
regarding reported ADHD and loud and frequent 
snoring was similar between the 2 groups, the data

were pooled. Thus, a total of 5728 responses was 
achieved (47.6%). For the total sample, frequent and 
loud snoring was reported for 673 children (11.7%). 
Similarly, 418 children were reported by their parents 
as being hyperactive or having a diagnosis of 
ADHD (7.3%). Of these, 313 (76.5%) were boys. 

When 1 of the parents snored, there was a mild 
albeit significant increase in the risk for the child to 
snore (Table 1). However, snoring by both parents 
did not further increase the risk of snoring by the 
child. When a parent smoked, an increased risk for 
snoring by the child was apparent (Table 1). Furthermore, 
a dose-dependent effect of passive smoking on 
snoring emerged, particularly if one assumes that 
children tend to spend more time with their mother 
during waking hours (Table 1). 

Among the 418 children from the returned questionnaires 
who were reported to be hyperactive, 98 
were also reported as having frequent and loud snoring. 
Compared with the general sample, children 
who were reported to be hyperactive were significantly 
more likely to snore (OR: 2.30; 95% CI: 
1.8OR2.4; P . 
.00001). 

Subjective Sleep Assessment 

Subjective sleep disturbances were frequently reported 
for the children classified as having symptoms 
of ADHD based on the Conners’ Parent Rating 

Scale (Table 2). With the use of the questionnaire 
variables “difficulty initiating sleep,”“restless 
sleep,” and “willingness to fall asleep” as an arbitrary 
measure of sleep disturbance, 77% of children 
with significant ADHD symptoms, 70% of children 
with mild ADHD symptoms, and 43% of control 
children were reported to have sleep disturbances 
(P . 
.003 significant versus control; P . 
.05 mild 
versus control). 

Polysomnographic Variables 

Results of polysomnographic data are shown in 
Table 3. OSA (AHI 5) was present in 2 (5%) of 44 of 
children with significant symptoms, in 7 (26%) of 27 
children with mild symptoms, and in 2 (5%) of 39 
control children (P . 
.03 significant versus mild and 
P . 
.02 control versus mild). Analysis of variance 
revealed that rapid eye movement (REM) latency 
and proportion of REM sleep (%TST) were more 
likely to be affected in the significant symptoms 
group (P . 
.01 for REM latency and REM% for 
significant versus controls; P . 
.03 for REM latency 
and P . 
.02 for REM% for significant versus mild). 
The groups were not different for any other objective 
sleep measure. 

Two (5%) children with significant ADHD symptoms, 
2 (7%) children with mild symptoms, and 2 
(5%) control children had a PLM index of 10, and

none had any significant associated arousals. Furthermore, 
only 7 (16%) of those with significant 
symptoms, 4 (15%) of those with mild symptoms, 
and 5 (13%) controls had a PLM index of 5. 

Nine (20%) of 44 children with significant symptoms 
had 1 or more of the objective sleep disturbances 
(sleep efficiency 70%, PLM index 10, AHI 
5, or arousal index 20) compared with 13 (48%) of 
27 children with mild symptoms and 6 (15%) of 39 
control children (P . 
.03 significant versus mild; P . 
.01 mild versus controls). No subject in either group 
had 1 of the above sleep abnormalities. 

Neurobehavioral Variables 

The results of the neurocognitive test findings are 
shown in Table 4. As expected, the children with 
significant ADHD symptoms consistently performed 
worse on tasks related to language and memory 
skills, visuospatial tasks, and attention. 

Relationship Between Polysomnographic Measures and 
Neurobehavioral Function 

The correlations between the affected sleep variables 
(REM latency and REM%) and the domains of 
neurobehavioral function are shown in Table 5. REM 
latency and REM% both were significantly correlated 
with behavioral and neurocognitive measures. For 
further assessing whether the sleep variables could 
predict the presence of hyperactivity and disturbances 
in neurobehavioral function, logistic regression 
analysis was conducted. The dependent variable 
was reported ADHD symptoms or not, and sleep 
variables that were found to correlate with neurobehavioral 
function (ie, REM% and REM latency, Table 
5) were used in the model. Only REM% was included 
in the model and found to account for 6% of the total 
variance (P . 
.007, Nagelkerke R2). Linear regression 
was also performed for each neurobehavioral variable 
(dependent variable) with REM% and REM latency 
as the independent variables. REM% accounted 
for small but significant differences (4%–7%) 
of the variance for each of the following variables 

from the Conners’ Parent Rating Scale: oppositional 
subscale, hyperactive subscale, ADHD index, global 
restless/impulsive scale, Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) 
hyperactive/impulsive scale, and the DSM-IV total 
scale. The only affected variables of the Child Behavior 
Checklist and the DAS were the delinquency 
subscale and the verbal ability subscale, respectively. 
Variables affected by REM% on the NEPSY were 
language, visuospatial, and memory, whereas REM 
latency accounted for 5% of the variance of the attention/
executive function scale of the NEPSY. Altogether, 
although the effects of REM on these neurobehavioral 
functions were statistically significant, 
they were of small magnitude. 

DISCUSSION 

The major findings in this study were the increased 
frequency of snoring among children classified 
as having mild or significant symptoms of 
ADHD based on the Conners’ Parent Rating Scale 
randomly recruited from a community sample. Furthermore, 
we show that although parental reports 
indicated a high frequency of sleep problems, objective 
assessment of sleep markedly restricted the percentage 
of children with evidence of sleep abnormalities. 
Logistic regression demonstrated that the only 
affected sleep variable between the groups (REM%) 
had a small but significant effect on the variance of 
neurobehavioral function. Finally, among a group 
without significant ADHD symptoms but with mild 
behavioral hyperactivity (based on the Conners Parent 
Rating Scale), a significantly higher prevalence of 
OSA was present, suggesting that SDB may induce a 
mild behavioral hyperactive/inattentive phenotype. 

The overall response rate to the mailed questionnaires 
was good for a survey of the general population. 
Because no differences in the responses between 
those who responded to the initial mailing and those 
who completed the telephone questionnaires were 
found, we believe that the findings are valid for the 
cohort and essentially provides a very large commu

nity survey of sleep-associated snoring in a school 
district of US children. The prevalence of frequent 
snoring was similar to previous published studies in 
Europe that included a more restricted number of 
responders.2–4 It is interesting that we found that 
snoring by 1 of the parents increased the risk of 
snoring in the child. Our findings concur with those 
of Redline et al,34 who evaluated 399 children recruited 
from either 31 families in which a member 
was diagnosed with OSA or from 30 families without 
OSA. Indeed, these investigators found that a family 
history of OSA increased the risk for OSA in the 
offspring. However, they did not find increased risk 
for OSA in the presence of maternal smoking, after 
adjusting for other significant variables. This is in 
contrast with current findings, which suggest that 
the risk of nocturnal snoring is greatly increased not 
only when children are exposed to passive smoking 
but also as a function of the cigarette smoke exposure 
duration and intensity. Furthermore, in previous 
studies by Corbo et al and Forastiere et al,35,36 an 

increased risk of snoring in children exposed to passive 
smoking was indeed identified. Thus, this study 
has allowed for identification of both genetic and 
environmental risk factors for snoring during childhood 
in the United States. 

Although we did not perform rigorous assessments 
for ADHD as stipulated by DSM-IV criteria, 
we were able to confirm the presence of abnormal 
levels of hyperactivity using a validated measure 
and did not solely rely on a positive answer by the 
parents to the questions, “Does your child have 
ADHD?” and is, “Is your child hyperactive?” From 
our initial recruitment, only half of the children 
whose parents reported hyperactivity behaviors actually 
fulfilled the score criteria of the Conners’ 
ADHD index scale.29 These findings further highlight 
potential biases introduced by the use of parental 
reports when assessing for behavioral disturbances 
in epidemiologic surveys. It should be 
acknowledged, however, that by using the Conners’ 
scale we were still unable to establish a formal diag-

nosis of ADHD based on DSM-IV criteria, and that is 
a limitation of the current study. Our survey also 
further expands on previous findings by Chervin et 
al16,17 and Owens et al11 that children with ADHD 
are at higher risk for snoring and other symptoms 
suggestive of SDB. 

An expanded inquiry into parental perception of 
sleep quality in hyperactive children revealed that 
77% of the children with significant ADHD symptoms 
were considered to have a significant sleep 
problem by their parents. These findings confirm 
multiple earlier studies,10 –12 all of which found an 
increased prevalence of parent-reported sleep disturbances 
in hyperactive children. However, objective 
sleep disorders were identified in only 20% of these 
children in this community cohort, clearly a substantially 
lower frequency than the frequency derived 
from parental reports. This is of particular importance, 
given that the majority of studies reporting 
sleep disturbances in children with ADHD are based 
on parental perception rather than on objective assessments. 
Nevertheless, although children with significant 
ADHD symptoms are at higher risk for objective 
REM sleep disturbances compared with 
normal children, the prevalence of OSA in this cohort 
does not seem to differ from the prevalence in the 
general population.9,34,37 However, among children 
with mild ADHD symptoms, an unusually high frequency 
of OSA was found. Thus, our findings suggest 
that although OSA can induce statistically significant 
yet mild behavioral effects, it does not seem 
to mimic more severe ADHD symptoms as assessed 

by the Conners’ Parent Rating Scale. Therefore, in a 
child who presents with parental complaints of hyperactivity 
and who does not meet the diagnostic 
criteria of ADHD after undergoing a thorough evaluation 
as recently recommended by the American 
Academy of Pediatrics,33 a careful sleep history 
should be taken, and if snoring is present, then an 
overnight polysomnographic evaluation should be 
performed. 

The mechanism(s) by which OSA may contribute 
to hyperactivity remains unknown. It is possible that 
both the sleep fragmentation and episodic hypoxia 
that characterize OSA will lead to alterations in the 
neurochemical substrate of the prefrontal cortex and 
resultant executive dysfunction.38 Notwithstanding 
these considerations, sleep disturbances are frequently 
reported by parents of children with ADHD 
even when snoring is excluded.11 On the basis of the 
available literature, the comorbidity of OSA and 
ADHD could be shared by a substantial number of 
hyperactive children, and, in fact, it has been suggested 
that up to 25% of children with a diagnosis of 
ADHD may actually have OSA.16 However, our data 
suggest that children with mild hyperactive behaviors 
rather than children who are at risk for a diagnosis 
of ADHD are at higher risk for OSA. In addition, 
the overlap between ADHD/hyperactivity may 
be less prominent than previously estimated when 
medication status and psychiatric comorbidity are 
accounted for in the multivariate analysis.39 

Sleep fragmentation and consequent daytime 
sleepiness are another possible theoretical explana

tion for the potential relationships between disturbed 
sleep and ADHD. Evidence of increased 
sleepiness, measured by multiple sleep latency tests, 
was reported by Lecendreux et al40 in 30 children 
with ADHD who otherwise had no significant polysomnographic 
alterations. Therefore, these investigators 
surmised that ADHD may be accompanied by 
an intrinsic deficit in daytime alertness. 

Restless sleep is frequently reported by parents of 
children with ADHD.20,41 When accompanied by 
arousals, frequent limb movements could induce 
sleep fragmentation and daytime sleepiness. PLM 
disorder of sleep has been described in children with 
ADHD,42 and treatment of this condition often leads 
to substantial behavioral improvements.42– 45 
Chervin et al46 further reported a dose-dependent 
association between hyperactivity, measured by the 
Conners’ Parent Rating Scale, and PLM index, a finding 
that we were unable to replicate in our study (see 
below). Similarly, Konofal et al47 reported higher 
levels of nocturnal limb activity in 30 unmedicated 
children with ADHD when compared with 19 controls. 
However, no disruption of sleep continuity 
could be identified, so the implications of such findings 
remain unclear. 

Our findings do not support the concept that PLM 
during sleep are more frequent in hyperactive children.
46 However, our population was taken from a 
community sample, and not from a highly selected 
clinical population referred for sleep problems. In the 
present study, we postulate that PLM disorder may 
occur in a select group of children with more severe 
ADHD symptoms and may in fact represent a distinct 
categorical subset of ADHD. 

A reduction in proportion of REM sleep and increased 
REM latencies were found in our children 
with significant symptoms of ADHD, based on the 
Conners’ Parent Rating Scale. The exact implications 
of these findings are unclear, although both hyperactivity 
and neurocognitive measures associated 
with executive function were weakly but significantly 
correlated with REM sleep disturbance, suggesting 
that delayed REM onset and/or decreased 
REM percentage may impose a small but significant 
adverse effect on daytime functioning. These findings 
are not surprising when one considers some of 
the putative functions ascribed to REM sleep. In 
recent years, it has become apparent that REM sleep 
may play an important role in memory consolidation 
of a learned task.48 Memory for declarative or explicit 
types of tasks seems not to be affected by REM 
sleep loss, whereas memory and learning of cognitive 
procedural or implicit types of material such as 
visuospatial tasks is impaired. Visuospatial functions 
exhibited negative correlations with REM sleep measures 
in our cohort, suggesting that potential interventions 
aiming at improving REM sleep in these 
children may be accompanied by favorable changes 
in some of their neurobehavioral functions. 

CONCLUSION 

We present additional confirmatory evidence that 
symptoms of SDB are frequent in 5-to 7-year-old 
children and that the risk increases when parents 

snore or smoke cigarettes. In children with significant 
symptoms of ADHD, REM sleep disturbances 
are more frequent and may contribute mildly yet 
significantly to neurobehavioral function. However, 
these children do not seem to be at higher risk for 
OSA than controls. In contrast, in children with parentally 
perceived hyperactivity in whom moderate 
elevations in Conner’s ADHD scores are found, an 
unusually high prevalence of OSA was found. Although 
this latter finding will need to be confirmed 
by additional studies, it strongly suggests that OSA 
can induce hyperactive behaviors and that the latter 
may lead to unnecessary delays in OSA diagnosis 
and treatment.

THE PREVALENCE OF AUTISM 

“The current social context seems to exert a stronger influence on the debate than 
the scientific arguments. Although claims about an epidemic of autism and about 
its putative causes have the weakest empirical support, the subsequent controversy 
has put autism on the public agenda. In recent years, children with autism, their 
families, and professionals involved in their care and in research have seen welcome 
and legitimate increases in public funding. Yet, ironically, what has triggered 
substantial social policy changes in autism appears to have little connection with 
the state of the science. Whether this will continue to be the case in the future 
remains to be seen, but further consideration should be given to how and to why 
the least evidence-based claims have achieved such impressive changes in funding 
policy.”
