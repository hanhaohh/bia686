ABSTRACT. Objective. Sleep disorders can cause 
substantial morbidity but often remain undiagnosed 
among adults. We identified a series of children with 
sleep-related symptoms and reviewed medical chart 
notes for the previous 2 years to determine how often 
sleep problems had been addressed. 

Design. Observational. 

Setting. Two university-affiliated but community-
based general pediatrics clinics. 

Patients. Children, ages 2.0 to 13.9 years, with clinic 
appointments. 

Measures. Parental and child responses to a validated 
Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ) were used to identify 
patients at risk for chronic sleep-disordered breathing, 
periodic leg movements during sleep, insomnia, or 
excessive daytime sleepiness. Chart notes written within 
the previous 2 years were searched for sleep-related 
symptoms, diagnoses, or treatments. 

Results. A total of 830 questionnaires were completed; 
1395 chart notes of 86 symptomatic participants (mean 
age: 6.6 . 
3.1 years; 51% male) with 103 identified sleep 
problems were reviewed. Fewer than 15% of patients had 
current chart notes that mentioned any of the PSQ-defined 
sleep problems; diagnoses were mentioned for 2 of 
86 patients and no treatments were discussed. Among the 
103 sleep problems, only 16 received mention in any past 
or current note; 10 had led to a diagnosis; 4 had led to 
intervention; and 3 were treated in a manner likely to be 
effective. Seventy-four of the sleep problems (72%) occurred 
in children whose charts did mention something 
about sleep, but such notations rarely related to concerns 
uncovered by the PSQ. 

Conclusions. Children with PSQ-identified sleep 
problems at 2 general pediatrics clinics seldom had these 
problems addressed, diagnosed, or treated, despite discussions 
about some aspect of their sleep in the large 
majority of cases. These findings support expansion of 
clinician and parent education about sleep disorders in 
children. Pediatrics 2001;107:1375–1380; children, sleep,

pidemiologic and school-based studies suggest 
that sleep disorders are common among children. 
Difficulty with sleep onset or sleep maintenance 
occurs in ;10% to 20% of 8-to 9-year-old 
children,1 sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) occurs 
in ;1% to 3% of school-aged children,2,3 and excessive 
daytime sleepiness (EDS) seems to cause significant 
problems in at least 10% of school children.4 
Among children seen in general pediatric practices, 
the frequency of sleep disorders is likely to exceed 
that seen in the community, perhaps because respiratory, 
behavioral, and other disorders that commonly 
prompt pediatric visits are often associated 
with sleep disorders. For example, one sleep disorder, 
periodic leg movements during sleep (PLMS), is 
believed to be rare among all children but quite 
frequent among those with attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder, a common reason for visits to a 
pediatrician.5,6 

Pediatric sleep disorders cause significant consequences 
that remain incompletely defined but include 
effects on growth, cardiovascular health, cognitive 
function, and daytime behavior.7–9 Studies 
suggest that disruptive behavior disorders, such as 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, can sometimes 
be caused by undiagnosed sleep disorders, 
treatment for which improves the behavior.10,11 Academic 
grades of students at a wide range of ages are 
reduced by unrecognized sleep disorders and insufficient 
sleep.12–14 

Although the impact of occult sleep disorders has 
become increasingly clear, little work has been done 
to determine how effectively pediatricians identify 
and treat sleep disorders in children with suggestive 
symptoms. Chart reviews of adult patients in 1989 
and 1990 suggested that the large majority of sleep 
complaints remained unaddressed and fewer still 
were effectively diagnosed or treated.15 Since that 
time, sleep disorders have received much publicity 
and identification of them may have improved, but 
information relevant to children is still lacking. We 
therefore identified a series of children with sleep-
related symptoms in 2 general pediatric clinics and 
then reviewed medical records to determine whether 
those symptoms had been addressed, diagnosed, 
and treated within the previous 2 years. 

METHODS 

Participants 

Parents who accompanied their children to appointments at 
either of 2 general pediatrics clinics were recruited to sign an 
informed consent for this protocol, which was a component of a

larger institutional review board-approved study of sleep and 
behavior in children. Children older than 9 years of age or old 
enough to understand the study were asked to sign an informed 
assent. Criteria for enrollment included: 1) age between 2.00 and 

13.99 years, 2) parental ability to read and write, 3) absence of 
mental or physical impairment severe enough to preclude interpretation 
of behavioral information collected, and 4) presence of 
symptoms of SDB, PLMS, insomnia (INS), or EDS, as defined 
below. Participants were recruited between February 6, 1998 and 
July 20, 1999 by research assistants who attempted to approach all 
child–parent pairs at the clinics on designated days. 
Setting 

Both clinics are owned by the same large public university 
health system. Clinic A is staffed by 5 full-time faculty who 
finished residency training 3 to 15 years before the beginning of 
this study. Clinic B was recently bought by the university, without 
substantial change in that site’s practicing physician staff, which 
includes 4 pediatricians who finished training 3 to 35 years earlier. 
The clinic population at both sites is primarily community-based. 
The university owns a large health care maintenance organization, 
which accounts for ;35% of all visits to clinic A and 30% of all 
visits to clinic B. Residents see ;28% of the patients at clinic A and 

;20% of patients at clinic B, but always with attending physicians. 
Notes from all such patient visits are signed by both residents and 
attending physicians. 
Measures 

Parents waiting for their children’s appointments completed 
the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ), which we had previously 
developed and validated.16,17 Children’s help in completing the 
PSQ was encouraged. The PSQ contains ;70 closed question items 
that request yes, no, or don’t know responses. Instructions ask that 
questions be answered with reference to behavior in general 
rather than recent days, which may have been unusual if the child 
had been acutely ill. Several additional open-ended items ask 
about past medical history, medications, and family history. Question 
items for symptoms of SDB provide a validated screen for 
polysomnographically defined obstructive sleep apnea and upper 
airway resistance syndrome.17 Items about EDS also have been 
validated among children with and without these 2 diagnoses.17 
Polysomnographic data have not been used to validate the question 
items about INS; assessment of INS is generally based on the 
history rather than on polysomnography or other recordings. 
Finally, PLMS can be described to parents and observed by some 
of them.5,18 Although the absence of such an observation in no 
way excludes the diagnosis, the relatively rare parental affirmation 
that PLMS are present, based on a precise description of the 
movements, is likely to carry reasonable specificity and positive 
predictive value. 

Table 1 lists the combinations of PSQ items used to identify 
children with symptoms of SDB, PLMS, INS, and EDS. For SDB 
and PLMS, the aim was to identify children who clearly merited 
inquiry into the possibility that these disorders might be present. 
For INS and EDS, the aim was to identify children whose symptoms 
were severe. In this study, identification of a group of participants 
at high risk for sleep disorders was considered more 
important than detection of every potentially affected individual. 

Investigators contacted parents of symptomatic children by 
telephone to obtain permission to review medical records. All 
dictated, handwritten, and telephone notes written between the 
date of questionnaire completion and 2 years before were reviewed 
by one investigator (K.M.H.). Notation was made whenever 
a clinician mentioned: 1) a symptom related to the symptom-
complex identified by the PSQ, 2) a diagnosis that might explain 
the sleep-related symptoms, 3) a treatment designed to address 
those symptoms, 4) a treatment likely to address those symptoms 
effectively, and 5) any explicitly sleep-related problem. Table 2 
lists specific criteria by which patients’ notes were judged to 
contain each of these 5 elements. In contrast to PSQ-defined case 
ascertainment, chart review criteria were purposefully liberal to 
give the benefit of the doubt whenever possible. 

Investigators also extracted, from clinic notes, lists of current or 
ongoing medical problems for each child. These were then coded 
into the following categories: respiratory (in no cases SDB); cardiovascular; 
developmental, psychiatric, or behavioral; neurolog-

Analysis 

Within each group of patients affected by a given symptom-
complex, we calculated the frequencies with which current or past 
medical notes mentioned the relevant symptom, diagnosis, treatment, 
effective treatment, or any sleep-related issue. Age and 
gender were tested, within each symptom-complex group, for any 
increased likelihood that current or past chart notes would mention 
relevant sleep symptoms. The presence of current or ongoing 
medical problems was similarly tested when at least 5 children 
within the symptom-complex group had the medical problem. All 
analyses were performed with SAS, Version 6.12 (SAS Institute Inc, 
Cary, NC). The level of significance was set at P . 
.05. 

RESULTS 

Participants 

Approximately 1150 children of appropriate ages 
came with their parents to appointments at either of 
the 2 clinics while the PSQ was being distributed; 830 
questionnaires were completed; 100 participants 
were symptomatic for SDB, PLMS, INS, or EDS; and 
86 children had parents agreeable to review of located 
medical charts. The mean age of the 86 participants 
whose data form the basis for this report was 

6.6 . 
3.1 years, and 44 were boys (51%). Numbers of 
participants, mean ages, and gender for each symptomatic 
group are given in Table 3. Some participants

Chart Reviews 

The total number of chart notes reviewed was 1395 
for the 86 participants and between 2 and 85 for each 
participant. Fewer than 10% of patients had a chart 
note, from the day on which the PSQ was completed, 
that addressed symptoms relevant to PSQ-determined 
SDB, PLMS, or EDS (Table 4). Only 2 of 15 

participants with INS had a current note that mentioned 
the problem. Even fewer of the children (only 
2 of 86) had any diagnosis mentioned in a current 
note, and none had any treatment mentioned. However, 
14% to 20% of the SDB, PLMS, and INS children 
had a current note that did mention something about 
their sleep; in the EDS group, no note mentioned 
sleep. Notes from the previous 2 years, in aggregate, 
sometimes mentioned symptoms relevant to PSQ-
identified sleep problems—and then often contained 
diagnoses—except that in the PLMS group, no diagnoses 
were made for the symptoms. In all groups, 
treatments were rarely mentioned in past notes. The 
majority of patients with each symptom-complex 
had past notes that did mention some aspect of sleep 
but said nothing related to the PSQ-defined problem. 

Content of current and past notes, considered together, 
resembled that of past notes alone (Table 4). 
Among the 103 sleep problems identified by the PSQ 
in the 86 children, 16 of the problems (16%) had 
corresponding symptoms mentioned in any note, 10 
(10%) had diagnoses mentioned, 4 (4%) had treatments 
listed, and 3 (3%) had a treatment likely to be 
effective listed. Although 74 (72%) of the 103 problems 
were associated with at least 1 notation of sleep 
information during the past 2 years, most notations 
were completely unrelated to the sleep problem 
identified by the PSQ. 

Age, Gender, Clinic Site, and Medical Problems 

For each type of PSQ-defined sleep problem, simple 
logistic regression models of current or past mention 
of relevant symptoms on age and then gender 
showed no associations (P . 
.05). Similarly, Fisher’s 
exact test revealed no statistically significant differences 
between clinics A and B in the frequencies with 
which relevant symptoms were mentioned. 

Among the 44 SDB children, 18 had respiratory 
problems and 5 of these (28%) had SDB symptoms 
mentioned in their charts, whereas none of the 26 
children without respiratory problems had SDB 
symptoms mentioned (Fisher’s exact test, P . 
.008). 
In contrast, absence of medical problems (n . 
22) 
was always associated with absence of SDB symptoms 
in charts, whereas 5 (23%) of SDB children with 
medical problems did have mention of such symptoms 
in their charts (P . 
.048). Other medical problems 
were too infrequent to be tested within the SDB 
group. 

Among the 33 PLMS children, respiratory problems 
and absence of medical problems showed no 
association with chart mention of symptoms related 
to PLMS (P . 
.05). Among the 15 INS children, 
absence of medical problems showed no association 
with mention of INS-related symptoms. Among the 
11 EDS children, no single medical problem was 
common enough to permit statistical testing with 
reasonable power, but the 2 children with respiratory 
problems were the only 2 who had sleepiness mentioned 
in their charts, and this result was significant 
(P . 
.018).

Chart Mention of Sleep Symptoms Other Than Those 
Identified by PSQ 

Although only 5 (11%) of 44 patients whose PSQ 
results suggested SDB had symptoms of SDB discussed 
in their medical notes, 12 (27%) had INS 
discussed. Similarly, although only 5 (15%) of 33 
patients (15%) with PSQ results suggestive of PLMS 
had directly related symptoms discussed in their 
notes, 18 (55%) had INS discussed and 6 (18%) had 
EDS discussed. 

DISCUSSION 

This review of medical records for 86 children with 
prominent symptoms of chronic sleep disorders suggests 
that pediatricians rarely discuss such symptoms, 
establish an underlying diagnosis, or institute 
needed treatment. Items from a validated questionnaire 
were used to detect children at substantial risk 
for SDB or PLMS, or to identify children with particularly 
problematic EDS and INS. In contrast, 
charts were reviewed with liberal interpretation of 
information as sleep-related. Despite this conservative 
study design, notes written during a 2-year interval 
indicate that the pediatricians at the 2 clinics 
discussed only 16 of 103 sleep problems and effectively 
treated only 3. 

Data for comparison to these findings are scarce. In 
1989 and 1990 the National Commission on Sleep 
Disorders Research searched records of over 10 million 
patients in large US primary care practice databases 
for codes that represented sleep disorders.15 
They found only 73 such occurrences, all of which 
were codes for obstructive sleep apnea, despite a 
prevalence among adults of ;3% for this disorder 
and much higher rates for conditions that cause 
INS.19,20 The Commission then examined in detail 
full written records for over 10 000 patients in family 
practice settings. Among 50 000 physician–patient 
contacts, notes that mentioned sleep were found for 
only 123. In none of these cases did the notes discuss 
an effective response to the patient’s complaint. The 

commission summarized their findings in this way: 
“The conclusion is inescapable. At the present time, 
most Americans with sleep disorders have no recourse 
but to suffer from their disorder. Unless fortunate 
enough to know about a sleep disorders center 
or to see a physician who does, the vast majority 
of these people will continue to suffer from the 
symptoms and other consequences associated with 
their specific illness.”15 

During the last decade, much progress has been 
made in both public and professional education 
about sleep disorders. Obstructive sleep apnea, in 
particular, has been the subject of many newspaper 
articles, magazine features, talk shows, and TV news 
journals. A recent epidemiologic study suggested 
that nearly 20% of middle-aged men and 10% of 
middle-aged women with symptomatic obstructive 
sleep apnea have been diagnosed.21 However, data 
for children remain largely unavailable. Many pediatricians 
expect questions from tired parents about 
sleep in infants, and many are familiar with common 
behavioral sleep disorders that emerge in subsequent 
years. However, the results of the current study suggest 
that other primary sleep problems may remain 
unaddressed in the large majority of affected children. 


One problem likely to cause underrecognition of 
sleep disorders in children may be lack of physician 
training in this area. A 1978 survey found that 46% 
of medical schools offered no education or training 
in sleep disorders and that another 38% provided 
only occasional or fragmented information.22 A 
1990–1991 survey of all 126 accredited US medical 
schools found that on average ,2 hours of total 
teaching time was allocated to sleep and its disorders; 
37 schools reported no structured teaching time 
in sleep medicine.23 More than two thirds of survey 
respondents thought that additional time should be 
spent, but reported obstacles included unavailability 
of qualified faculty, lack of curriculum time, and the 
need for additional clinical and educational re

sources. A 1992 survey of professional training programs 
found that, on average, pediatrics programs 
offered only ;5 hours of didactic instruction in sleep 
disorders, and .40% of programs offered none.24,25 
An assessment of 88 pediatricians’ knowledge about 
sleep disorders suggested that they knew most about 
developmental issues and sleep hygiene and least 
about more specific sleep disorders.25 

Another problem is that patients may not know 
that they should mention sleep problems to their 
physicians.15 Parents of young children seem to be 
more concerned about sleep problems than about 
difficulties with language development, motor development, 
toileting, and teething.25 However, 
adults often suffer from sleep symptoms for many 
years before they mention anything to their own 
physicians, and parents may not act differently on 
behalf of their children. 

Failure to recognize childhood sleep problems 
may be exacerbated by a dearth of pediatricians who 
are fellowship-trained in sleep medicine. Many sleep 
specialists see both adults and children with sleep 
complaints, but the number of pediatric sleep specialists 
is still miniscule. 

In the current study, lack of discussion of important 
sleep problems cannot be attributed to lack of 
any discussion about sleep: the large majority of 
children had notes about their sleep somewhere in 
their charts. Common chart comments such as 
“sleeps well” or “cough wakes her during sleep” 
suggest that discussions about sleep may be too brief 
or too focused on potential effects of known medical 
problems. At the same time, our findings also suggest 
that pediatricians may uncover SDB and EDS in 
some children precisely because a respiratory disorder 
other than SDB leads to consideration that the 
SDB might also be present. In other cases, pediatricians 
may uncover important sleep symptoms, such 
as INS, without knowing to ask about potential specific 
causes, such as PLMS.18 

The current study is limited in several respects. It 
focused on only 2 general pediatrics clinics and is not 
an epidemiologic sample. The numbers of participants 
who qualified for this study reflect the protocol 
used to define sleep symptom-complexes rather than 
the prevalence of particular sleep problems. Although 
a number of pediatricians were involved 
with the 1395 patient contacts that were reviewed, 
these clinicians and patients may not adequately represent 
medical practices or problems at other sites. 
The results derived from the 2 clinics do not imply 
that care delivered there was in any way substandard; 
on the contrary, the academic affiliations of 
these clinics may have resulted in better identification 
of sleep problems than might be observed at 
sites without ready access to a sleep disorders center. 
This study used chart notes as proxy measures of 
discussions between caregivers, patients, and their 
parents. In some cases, such notes may inadequately 
document sleep-related inquiries, diagnoses, and 
recommendations that did take place. Finally, PSQ-
identified sleep problems, such as SDB, PLMS, EDS, 
and INS, are often but not always chronic. In many 
cases, chart notes from as far as 2 years before PSQ 

completion may have omitted mention of sleep problems 
because no such problems existed at the time. 

The apparent neglect of important pediatric sleep 
problems deserves study among additional practices, 
definition of underlying causes, and development 
of strategies to address the problem. The National 
Sleep Disorders Center, within the National 
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, has sponsored an 
initiative to improve sleep medicine education, and 
20 groups are now able to develop and test tools that 
will be useful at several different stages of training. 
The first of these tools are now available for free at 
the MEDSleep website, http://www.asda.org/ 
medsleep/home.htm. Wider dissemination of such 
strategies will have to be coupled with a growing 
understanding among program directors that time 
for education in sleep medicine must be inserted into 
already crowded curricula. Finally, education of the 
lay public should not be neglected in an effort to end 
needless sleepiness, behavioral problems, academic 
underachievement, and other morbidity associated 
with occult sleep disorders in children.

NUMBER OF NEW INTERNET USERS IS GROWING 

A report released . . . by the Pew Internet and American Life Project found that 
the number of American adults with Internet access grew by 16 million the last 6 
months of 2000. That brings the total number of adults using the Internet in the 
United States to 104 million, or 56% of the adult population . . . The Pew study also 
measured the number of the nation’s children using the Internet, finding that 30 
million, or 45% of those under 18, have online access. Almost three-quarters of 
those in middle school and high school (ages 12–17) have access, compared with 
almost a third of those under 12 . . . The measurements of the Pew study are 
comparable to a survey released . . . by Nielsen/NetRatings, which found that 60% 
of the US population has Internet access.
