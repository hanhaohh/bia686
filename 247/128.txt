Study Objectives: Snoring and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) are 
highly prevalent among children. The increasing trends of obesity in the 
pediatric population further predict an exacerbation of this public health 
problem. However, the impact of SDB on mood and quality of life and the 
confounder effect of obesity in this setting are unclear. 
Design: We studied a group of 85 clinically referred children, aged 8 to 12 
years, with snoring and suspected SDB and 35 asymptomatic children 
(controls). All children completed validated questionnaires for the presence 
of depression (Children’s Depression Inventory) and for health-related 
quality of life (PedsQL.), and parents completed the Parent Report 
version of the PedsQL.. Children referred to the Sleep Medicine Center 
for sleep-disordered breathing were further subdivided according to their 
body mass index > 95% for age and sex (n = 44) and with BMI < 95% for 
age and sex as ClinN1 (n = 41). 

Results: Parentally reported quality of life and physical health differed 
between obese and nonobese children. However, both groups with SDB 
had more-impaired quality of life and depressive symptoms than did controls. 
Conclusions: Children with suspected SDB, regardless of the severity of 
apnea-hypopnea index or the presence of obesity, had more impairments 
in quality of life and depressive symptoms than did children who did not 
snore.

INTRODUCTION 

IN ADULT PATIENTS, SLEEP-DISORDERED BREATHING 
(SDB) HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH BOTH DEPRESSION1 
AND IMPAIRED QUALITY OF LIFE.2 While no studies 
have specifically addressed the relationship between depression 
and SDB in children, impaired quality of life, neurocognitive 
deficits, poor school performance, behavioral problems, and 
hyperactivity have all recently emerged as important morbidities 
of this frequent pediatric disorder3-9 and appear to coincide in 
obese children with SDB,10 underlying the potential associations 
between obesity, SDB, quality of life, and depression. 

The prevalence of obesity in children has increased dramatically 
over the past 30 years, from 4% in 6- to 11-year-old children 
during the period of 1963-1974 to 13% in 1999, according 
to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.11 An

Services has recommended that all children with a body mass 
index (BMI) fulfilling the overweight criteria should receive a 
thorough medical assessment to evaluate possible underlying 
causes and to determine concomitant medical problems. Among 
the multiple morbidities associated with obesity, respiratory sleep 
disturbances, in general, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and 
obesity hypoventilation syndrome, in particular, should be considered 
and evaluated.12 

In addition to the physical health risks associated with being 
overweight, children may be at risk of psychological distress. 
The relationship between obesity and symptoms of depression in 
children has not been clearly established. While some studies 
have found a stronger relationship between weight concerns 
(rather than weight, per se) and depression,13 others have found a 
strong association between obesity and depressive symptoms in 
childhood.14 Furthermore, childhood-onset obesity has been 
associated with later psychopathology in adulthood, suggesting 
vulnerability in later psychological functioning among obese 
children.15 

Dietz reported that perhaps the most significant difficulty associated 
with obesity in children was the negative psychosocial 
impact.16 Many children who are overweight appear older than 
their age, leading adults to have unrealistically high expectations 
of them. When these expectations are not met, children may feel 
frustrated and become increasingly dependent upon their families 
and isolated from others. Depressed overweight children may 
respond more poorly to weight management programs and, therefore, 
are in need of psychological treatment in addition to strict 
weight-management programs.12,17 

Obese children report a more negative quality of life than do 
children with chronic health conditions such as asthma or atopic 
dermatitis.18 Severely obese children report a lower health-related 
quality of life (HRQOL) than do healthy children and an 

Health-related Quality of Life, Depressive Symptoms with SDB—Crabtree et al 


HRQOL similar to that of children diagnosed with cancer.10 The 
impairments in quality of life, however, appear to be responsive 
to cognitive-behavioral intervention after an in-patient rehabilitation 
weight-loss program.18,19 While some studies have assessed 
the quality of life18,19and depressive symptoms13 of children who 
are overweight, very few have included a control group of normal-
weight children in their assessments.10 

Therefore, to examine the relationship among SDB, obesity, 
and psychosocial variables, we hypothesized that the presence of 
snoring and of obesity in children would independently lead to 
increased depression and decreased HRQOL in comparison to 
normal weight and healthy children. 

METHODS 

Participants 

Eighty-five consecutive children between the ages of 8 and 12 
years who were referred to the Kosair Children’s Hospital Sleep 
Medicine Center for suspected SDB were recruited as the clinic-
referred group. Children were classified as obese if their BMI 
was greater than or equal to the 95th percentile for their age and 
sex, as established by the National Center for Health Statistics 
and according to the Centers for Disease Control BMI-for-age 
growth charts. Children were classified as normal weight if their 
BMI was below the 95th percentile. On this basis, 44 children 
referred for SDB fulfilled the criteria for obesity (ClinOb), and 
the remaining 41 snoring children were considered as normal 
weight (ClinNl). Thirty-five additional children between the ages 
of 8 and 10 years whose parents reported that their children had 
no symptoms of SDB in a questionnaire mailed to former non-
snoring participants in a study of childhood SDB were recruited 
to participate as the control group. Because it was not feasible to 
recruit control children who were perfectly matched to the Clin 
groups, controls were matched on as many variables as possible, 
including age, sex, and geographical region of residence. Four 
children in the control group had a BMI above the 95th percentile 
for age and sex. Because this number was too small to analyze 
separately, these children were excluded, and only the responses 
of children without obesity were analyzed (Control; n = 31). 

Snoring children with an AHI of at least 1 but 5 or less per hour 
of total sleep time (TST) with no clinically significant hypoxemia, 
hypercapnia, or excessive daytime sleepiness were considered 
to have primary snoring (PS), while children with clinically 
significant hypoxemia, hypercapnia, daytime sleepiness, an AHI 
of at least 5 per hour of TST, or a combination thereof, were considered 
to have SDB. The definition used for clinically significant 
hypoxemia was the presence of any events associated with 
oxyhemoglobin desaturations > 3% and a mean SaO2 = 
95%, 
while that for hypercapnia required the presence of end-tidal carbon 
dioxide tension values > 50 mmHg for more than 3% of the 
total recording time. Sleepiness was considered to be potentially 
present if parental reports based on a modified questionnaire similar 
to the Epworth Sleepiness Scale was suggestive of daytime 
sleepiness or the recently derived intrapolysomnographic sleep 
pressure score was = 
0.25 or both.20 SDB was further classified 
as mild or moderate to severe by physician analysis of presenting 
concerns, AHI, respiratory arousal index, and magnitude of 
hypoxemia and hypercapnia.21 Control children had documented 
absence of snoring after having previously undergone 
polysomnography (PSG) as part of a study conducted by O’Brien 

et al.19 Furthermore, parental report indicated that the children 
continued to be nonsnoring. 

Questionnaires 

Parents completed the parent version of the Pediatric Quality 
of Life Inventory, Version 4.022 (PedsQL. 
4.0), and the children 
completed the Children’s Depression Inventory33 (CDI) and child 
version of the PedsQL. 
4.0 during visits to the sleep medicine 
center. Control subjects completed the questionnaires by mail. 
Children in the clinic groups had their height and weight measured 
by medical staff at their clinic visits. Height and weight of 
the children in the control group were provided by parental report 
on the mailed questionnaire. 

The PedsQL. 4.0 

The 23-item PedsQL. 
4.0 Generic Core Scales, developed by 
Varni,22 include (1) Physical Functioning (8 items), (2) 
Emotional Functioning (5 items), (3) Social Functioning (5 
items), and (4) School Functioning (5 items) and were created 
through focus groups, interviews, pretesting, and field-testing 
measurement development protocols.22,23 

The PedsQL. 
4.0 Generic Core Scales are comprised of parallel 
child self-report and parent-report formats. The parent report 
is a proxy report and assesses parents’ perceptions of their children’s 
HRQOL. The items for each of the forms are essentially 
identical, differing in developmentally appropriate language or 
first- or third-person viewpoint. The instructions ask how much 
of a problem each item has been during the past month. A 5-point 
response scale is utilized (0 = never a problem; 1 = almost never 
a problem; 2 = sometimes a problem; 3 = often a problem; 4 = 
almost always a problem). 

Items are reverse scored and linearly transformed to a 0 to 100 
scale (0 = 100, 1 = 75, 2 = 50, 3 = 25, 4 = 0), so that higher scores 
indicate better HRQOL. Scale Scores are computed as the sum of 
the items divided by the number of items answered (this accounts 
for missing data). If more than 50% of the items in the scale are 
missing, the Scale Score is not computed.24 The PedsQL. 
4.0 is 
the only non–disease-specific pediatric HRQOL measurement 
instrument to our knowledge to maintain item and scale construct 
consistency while covering a 2- to 18-year-old age range.25-28 

Through validation studies, child-report measures have reflected 
significantly lower scores (reflecting poorer quality of life) in 
all subscales among children with chronic and acute illnesses 
than among healthy children.29-32 Parent reports have shown 
poorer quality of life among chronically ill than among acutely ill 
children. Furthermore, acutely ill children’s parents have reported 
poorer quality of life than have healthy children’s parents. A 
multitrait-multimethod matrix has reflected a correlation between 
parent and child report; however, most scales have had correlation 
coefficients below 0.50, reflecting the importance of surveying 
both the child and the parent.22 

Children’s Depression Inventory 

The CDI, developed by Kovacs, is a 27-item self-report measure 
of depressive symptoms in children ages 7 to 17 years.33 
Children are presented with a forced choice of 3 statements and 
asked to think of their feelings over the previous 2 weeks and 
determine which statement best describes themselves. Scores

obtained from the CDI include Total, Negative Mood, 
Interpersonal Problems, Ineffectiveness, Anhedonia, and 
Negative Self-Esteem.33 

Polysomnography 

A standard overnight multichannel PSG evaluation was performed 
for 72 children in the Clin groups in the sleep laboratory. 
Although all children in the Clin groups had been referred for 
nocturnal PSG, the remaining 13 failed to return to the clinic for 
PSG. Children were studied for up to 12 hours in a quiet darkened 
room with an ambient temperature of 24oC in the company of 1 
of their parents. No drugs were used to induce sleep. The following 
parameters were measured: chest and abdominal wall movement 
by respiratory impedance or inductance plethysmography; 
heart rate by electrocardiogram; air flow with a sidestream end-
tidal capnograph, which also provided breath-by-breath assessment 
of end-tidal carbon-dioxide levels (PETCO2; BCI SC-300, 
Menomonee Falls, Wisc), an oronasal thermistor, and a nasal 
pressure transducer. SpO2 was assessed by pulse oximetry 
(Nellcor N 100; Nellcor Inc., Hayward, Calif), with simultaneous 
recording of the pulse waveform. The bilateral electrooculogram, 
8 channels of electroencephalogram, chin and anterior tibial electromyograms, 
and analog output from a body-position sensor 
(Braebon Medical Corporation, NY) were also monitored. All 
measures were digitized using a commercially available PSG 
system (Rembrandt, MedCare Diagnostics, Amsterdam). 
Tracheal sound was monitored with a microphone sensor 
(Sleepmate, Virg), and a digital time-synchronized video recording 
was performed. 

Sleep architecture was assessed by standard techniques.34 The 
proportion of time spent in each sleep stage was expressed as a 
percentage of TST. Awakenings were defined as a sustained 
arousal lasting longer than 15 seconds. Sleep efficiency was 
defined as TST divided by total recording time. The apnea index 
(AI) was defined as the number of apneas per hour of TST. 
Central, obstructive, and mixed apneic events were counted. 
Obstructive apnea was defined as the absence of airflow with 
continued chest wall and abdominal movement for duration of at 
least 2 breaths.35-36 Hypopneas were defined as a decrease in 
nasal flow of at least 50% with a corresponding decrease in SpO2 
of at least 4%, an arousal, or both. The obstructive apnea-hypopnea 
index (AHI) was defined as the number of apneas and hypopneas 
per hour of TST. 

The mean SpO2, as measured by pulse oximetry in the presence 
of a pulse waveform signal void of motion artifact, and the SpO2 
nadir were recorded. Because criteria for arousals have not yet 
been developed for children, arousals were defined as recommended 
by the American Sleep Disorders Association Task Force 
report37 using the 3-second rule, the presence of movement 
arousal, or both.38 Arousals were divided into 2 types: spontaneous 
arousals and respiratory arousals. The total number of 
arousals was also calculated. The corresponding arousal indexes 
were calculated as a function of TST duration and are expressed 
as number per hour of sleep. No child had a TST of less than 4 
hours, and all children had slow-wave and rapid eye movement 
sleep. 

Descriptive statistics consisting of means and SD were used for 
initial assessment of the data and were followed by analyses of 
variance (ANOVA) procedures followed by posthoc tests, as 

appropriate, and multiple regression. .2 analyses were also utilized 
to determine differences in proportion of children meeting 
clinically significant levels of depressive symptoms. Statistical 
significance was set at a P value < .05. 

RESULTS 

One hundred twenty children and their parents participated in 
the study. The ClinOb group consisted of 44 children with a mean 
age of 10.05 ± 1.5 years and a mean BMI of 30.82 ± 6.5 kg/m2; 
the ClinNl group comprised 41 children with a mean age of 10.17 
± 1.4 years and a mean BMI of 18.31 ± 2.7 kg/m2; and the control 
group included 31 children with a mean age of 9.56 ± .9 years 
and a mean BMI of 17.50 ± 2.9 kg/m2. Significantly more 
Caucasian children were represented in the Control group than in 
the ClinNl group. No other significant differences were observed 
in the demographics of the groups, other than targeted differences 
in BMI and weight (Table 1). PSG recordings for the ClinOb and 
ClinNl children revealed no significant differences in objective 
sleep recordings between the 2 groups (P, not significant; Table 
2). 

Both Clin groups had significantly lower scores on the

to children in the control group (Table 3; ANOVA, F = 
32.83, P< .001 Parent-Report; F = 13.24, P< .001 Child-

6.99, P< .01 ClinOb; .2 = 5.21, P < .05 ClinNl; Table 6). 

Following nocturnal PSG, children in the clinically referred 
groups were divided into those with primary snoring (PS; n = 31) 
and those with SDB (n = 31). The remaining 10 children had 
other diagnoses (ie, periodic limb movement disorder, insomnia, 
no diagnosis). No significant differences emerged in either 
HRQOL or depressive symptoms between PS and SDB (P, not 
significant; Table 7). Children were further subdivided into those 
with PS (n = 31), mild SDB (n = 16), and moderate to severe 
SDB (n = 15) based upon 2 independent physicians’ judgments of 
clinical severity. Decisions were based upon AHI, hypoxemia, 
hypercapnia, and excessive daytime sleepiness.21 No significant 
differences emerged among groups in parent- or child-reported 
HRQOL or child-reported symptoms of depression (P, not significant; 
Table 8). Multiple regression was then used to determine 
if SDB severity as measured by AHI, respiratory arousal index, 
mean SaO2 level, nadir oxygen level, and apnea index explained 
the variance in parent- and child-reported HRQOL or symptoms 
of depression. None of these variables independently, or in combination, 
explained a significant degree of variance in HRQOL 
(Parent Report R2 = .09, P > .05; Child Report R2 = .08, P > .05) 
or depressive symptoms (CDI Total R2 = .04, P > .05).

DISCUSSION 

The findings of this study indicate that snoring children are not 
only at high risk for decreased HRQOL, but are also at high risk 
for the presence of depressive symptoms, particularly anhedonia. 
Furthermore, the presence of obesity in snoring children is not 
associated with differences in reported HRQOL or depressive 
symptoms compared to snoring children of normal weight. 
However, assessment of parental perception for obese snoring 
children revealed significantly worse quality of life than for 
nonobese children with SDB, and these differences were particularly 
related to parentally reported physical health impairments in 
obese children. These latter findings are similar to the physical 
health impairments observed by Rosen et al in children with 
SDB.4 However, in the cohort studied by Rosen and colleagues, 
children with more severe SDB also had significantly higher 
BMI.4 In contrast, no differences occurred between the severity 
of SDB and reported impaired HRQOL due to physical health in 
the present cohort. As such, the impairments in parentally reported 
physical health of the children appear to be more related to 
BMI than to SDB status, since no other parent- or child-reported 
quality of life differences emerged between the 2 groups, and 
since obese snoring children did not report more depressive 
symptoms than snoring children of normal weight. Additionally, 
Schwimmer and colleagues10 have also shown that higher BMI in 
children is associated with increased impairments in parent-
reported physical health, further supporting this relationship. 

Children with reported SDB symptoms had both parent- and 
child-reported significant impairments in HRQOL that were 
independent of what has been considered as clinically significant 
AHI, but were markedly different from the control group of children 
with no SDB symptoms. Of note, the level of impaired 
HRQOL was substantially greater than that reported by chronically 
ill children and their parents in the validation study of the 
PedsQL™ 4.0 22 and of children with obesity who did not have 
OSA in the study conducted by Schwimmer and colleagues.10 
Furthermore, the total and physical health PedsQL™ 4.0 scores 
are very similar to those found in obese children with OSA studied 
by Schwimmer et al.10 While the mechanisms underlying the 
decrease in HRQOL in snoring children are unclear, it is likely 
that the sleep disturbance associated with snoring increases 
fatigue in children and, that as fatigue increases, snoring children 
will experience increased irritability, depressed mood, impaired 
concentration, and decreased interest in daily activities. These 
impairments in daily functioning may, in turn, interfere with 
functioning in all aspects of the child’s life, including family, 
school, and peers. As a result, a vicious cycle may develop and 
lead to more impaired quality of life in all areas and to the presence 
of more depressive symptoms. 

The report of anhedonia was one of the most substantial findings 
in the present study. Indeed, 36% of obese snoring children 
and 31% of normal-weight snoring children reported levels of 
anhedonia that were 1 SD above the mean in comparison to only 
6% of control children. These findings further support the notion 
that the fatigue and sleepiness that emanate from disrupted sleep 
architecture in the context of snoring may greatly interfere with 
daily functioning. Not surprisingly, the more fatigued a child is, 
the more likely he or she will be to withdraw from previous activities. 
Similarly, as anhedonia increases, it is likely to interfere 
with quality of life. Taken together, the marked effect of snoring 

on the anhedonia scale of the CDI raises the possibility that some 
children with an underlying propensity for depression may develop 
overt clinical symptoms of this disorder if SDB is concurrently 
present. Notwithstanding the prominence of the effect of snoring 
on depressive scales, however, this study did not examine the 
reversibility of the affected measures in the CDI or in the 
PedsQL™ 4.0. Such study would be of great importance in more 
forcefully establishing the causal relationship between snoring, 
depression, and HRQOL. 

Interestingly, no differences in quality of life or depressive 
symptoms were observed among children with PS, mild SDB, or 
moderate to severe SDB. The absence of any differences in 
depressive symptoms or HRQOL as it pertains to the severity of 
sleep-related breathing impairments (ie, hypoxemia, hypercapnia, 
respiratory-related arousals, AHI) would suggest that snoring 
should not be viewed simply as an “innocuous” symptom, since 
its presence may significantly interfere with children’s psychosocial 
functioning.39 This observation is consistent with a recent 
study from our laboratory on the association between PS and 
impaired neurocognitive functioning, whereby even children 
with PSG findings that would otherwise be considered clinically 
irrelevant (American Academy of Pediatrics consensus) demonstrated 
significant deficits in specific areas of behavior and cognitive 
ability.39 Thus, the present study further stresses the importance 
of snoring and sleep disturbances as major contributing factors 
in the quality of life and in the occurrence of symptoms of 
depression among children with and without obesity. AHI was 
poorly predictive of psychosocial functioning in these children, 
and while it is tempting to use AHI as an index of severity of disease, 
it is clear from these findings that snoring is a more important 
marker of daytime impairment. 

As mentioned above, while the present study has shed light on 
important determinants of psychosocial functioning in snoring 
children, it is unclear how children’s HRQOL and magnitude of 
depressive symptoms will change following treatment of SDB. In 
a sample of 64 children, Goldstein and colleagues found that 
reports of sleep disturbance, caregiver concerns, and physical 
symptoms were all improved after tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. 
However, SDB was not assessed by overnight PSG, and 
BMI was not specifically reported.40 Based on the study by 
Goldstein at al and the present study, it is possible that after tonsillectomy 
and adenoidectomy, all children with SDB will 
demonstrate improvements in their quality of life and depressive-
symptom measures. Alternatively, if SDB imposes a masking 
effect on the impact of obesity on psychosocial functioning, normal-
weight children will reveal improvements after tonsillectomy 
and adenoidectomy in quality of life and depressive symptoms, 
but such improvements will be absent or attenuated in 
obese children. A goal of our laboratory is to further clarify this 
issue by examining the HRQOL and mood of these children after 
SDB has been treated with tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. 

While the present study has shed light on the importance of 
snoring in children’s reduced psychosocial functioning, several 
limitations were present. The clinic-based sample in the current 
study precluded a rigorous examination of factors that may have 
further contributed to reduced quality of life and increased 
depression in the clinic group. Socioeconomic status, parental 
education, and neurocognitive status were not measured, and, 
thus, their contribution to the sample’s psychosocial functioning 
cannot be assessed. Furthermore, snoring children who present to 

SLEEP, Vol. 27, No. 6, 2004 1136 Health-related Quality of Life, Depressive Symptoms with SDB—Crabtree et al 


sleep disorders centers may be inherently different from snorers 
in the community. Snoring children who experience impaired 
quality of life and depression may be more likely to seek treatment 
for their SDB. However, parents did not report any changes 
in mood, affect, or HRQOL during clinical interviews or when 
completing clinic-based questionnaires. Only when these variables 
were directly assessed were these daytime impairments 
noted. Rather, at initial presentation to the clinic, parents focused 
on their children’s nighttime SDB symptoms. We believe that 
parents’ reasons for seeking treatment are significant regarding 
the likelihood that the snoring children presenting to the clinic 
did not differ in regard to mood state from snoring children in the 
community. 

Additional limitations regarding the recruitment of the control 
group must be noted. Because the control group was recruited 
from the community, unforeseen variables may have differed 
between the groups. The absence of an obese control group from 
the community further limited the conclusions that can be drawn 
from the results. Unfortunately, only 4 of the 35 control children 
had a BMI above the 95th percentile. Therefore, the sample size 
was insufficient for any valid comparisons and precluded assessment 
of the specific and individual roles of obesity and SDB in 
children’s psychosocial functioning. Although the recruitment of 
obese controls would undoubtedly have added to the strength of 
the conclusions, we were simply unable to do so at this time. Our 
experience with attempts to recruit obese controls in previous 
prospective studies has revealed that when obese children without 
presenting complaints of SDB are recruited, they are discovered 
on PSG examination to snore. Therefore, in a clinic-based 
study, this degree of recruitment was not feasible. 

It should also be noted that the age group selected in our study 
is older than the age at which peak prevalence of SDB occurs, 
namely 3 to 6 years. However, the sample selection was dictated 
by the age constraints imposed by the depression instrument used 
in this study, such that direct self-report of mood would not be 
possible in younger children. 

In summary, 8- to 12-year-old children who snore have substantially 
impaired quality of life and mood that appears to be 
unrelated to either the presence of obesity or of OSA. While the 
pathophysiologic mechanisms that mediate this novel facet of 
SDB-associated morbidity remain to be defined, our present findings 
suggest that all school-aged children with symptoms of snoring 
should have a thorough assessment of their current mood and 
overall emotional functioning.
