Objectives To evaluate the extent to which sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) varies with putative demographic and 
medical risk factors and to estimate the prevalence of undiagnosed SDB. 

Study design Prospective, cross-sectional study in a population-based cohort of 850 children (41% black, 46% preterm), 
8 to 11 years of age. Participants’ caretakers completed questionnaires about health and sleep. Children underwent 
overnight in-home cardiorespiratory recordings of airflow, respiratory effort, oximetry, and electrocardiography. SDB was 
identified by respiratory disturbance indices commonly applied in clinical practice. Risk factors were estimated by logistic 
regression. Prevalence was derived from cohort-specific estimates with birth weights from US live births data. 

Results Using the most inclusive definition, SDB was detected in 40 (4.7%) participants, with prevalence varying widely 
across population subsets. Depending on the definition used, SDB was 4 to 6 times more likely in black children compared 
with white children and almost 3 to 5 times more likely in former preterm compared with term children. The estimated 
population prevalence of SDB was 2.2% (95% CI, 1.2%, 3.2%). 

Conclusions SDB is a relatively common condition in 8- to 11-year-old children. Potentially vulnerable subgroups, black 
children, and former preterm infants, are at increased risk. (J Pediatr 2003;142:383-9)

13,14 The preterm infant is also more likely to have a variety 
of medical problems, including chronic respiratory disease 
or neurologic injury, which could influence SDB in later 
childhood. Access to a well-characterized cohort of preterm 
and term children would allow us to examine this potential relation. 


We used data from the Cleveland Children’s Sleep and 
Health Study (CCSHS), a unique population-based cohort of 
907 children, 8 to 11 years of age, to investigate the epidemiology 
of SDB. Stratified sampling was used to achieve a sample 
that included approximately 50% former preterm children. 
Using representative sampling methods, we estimated the 
prevalence rates of undiagnosed SDB and investigated the extent 
to which risk of SDB varied with race, sex, obesity, and 
prematurity. We hypothesized that prevalence rates would be 
highest in obese, former preterm, and black children. 

METHODS 

Study Sample 

The CCSHS is a population-based cohort of 907 children 
studied at 8 to 11 years of age. The study used questionnaires 
about sleep, breathing, and general health, in-home 
overnight cardiorespiratory studies, and other physiologic, 
neuropsychologic, and behavioral assessments (latter data are 
not presented here). This cohort was assembled as a stratified 
random sample of full-term and preterm children who were 
born between 1988 and 1993 and identified from the birth 
records of three Cleveland area hospitals. Preterm children 
were defined as <36 weeks’ gestational age at birth. 

In brief, 664 (72.7%) children were drawn from the original 
cohort of 913 children who had participated in longitudinal 
studies of cognition and behavior, the Low Birth Weight-Maternal 
Employment Study (LBW-MES).15 The recruitment procedures 
for this original cohort are outlined in the Appendix (see 
The Journal of Pediatrics Online at www.us.elsevierhealth 
.com/jpeds). Nonparticipation in the CCSHS cohort by original 
cohort members were due to having moved from area (4.7%); inability 
to locate (5.6%); refused (12.4%); and passive refusal (4.6% 
agreed to participate but did not complete study visits). Since the 
original LBW-MES cohort contained only 23% minorities, we 
expanded the CCSHS cohort to achieve the effective sample size 
of 907 children by recruiting a balanced sample of 243 preterm 
and term minority children, born at one of the three targeted hospitals 
(University Hospitals of Cleveland) during overlapping 
birth years as the original cohort. This additional minority recruitment 
for CCSHS came from a target sample of 1467 children 
born in the same eligible birth cohort years, between 2000 
and 2001. Of these, 711 (48%) were contacted, but 52% had either 
moved or could not be located through hospital contact information; 
10% of the contacted participants (n = 149) were 
ineligible because of serious (for example, mental retardation or 
severe cerebral palsy) conditions that precluded study participation. 
Of the remaining children who were contacted and eligible, 
320 parents/guardians agreed to participate and 243 (76%) completed 
the study protocol. 

Study Protocol 

Demographic and medical data were assessed with the 
Child Sleep Questionnaire, a pediatric modification of a validated 
questionnaire.16 Height and weight were directly measured, 
and body mass index was calculated (kg/m2). Methods 
for overnight home sleep studies were described previously.17 
In brief, limited channel cardiorespiratory recordings included 
thoracic and abdominal excursions and estimated tidal volume 
(by inductance plethysmography), pulse oximetry with waveform 
display, heart rate, and body position (PT-2 system, SensorMedics, 
Yorba Linda, Calif ). This equipment has been 
successfully used in other large-scale home observational studies.
18 Technically satisfactory home studies were obtained for 
94% of the sample. Minimum criteria for acceptable recordings 
included at least 4 hours of respiratory effort signals with 
concurrent reliable oximetry data. Participants were enrolled 
between September 1998 and October 2001. Institutional review 
boards approved the protocol at the participating hospitals. 
Informed consent was obtained from the parent/legal 
guardian of each child, and assent was obtained from the child. 

Scoring of Respiratory Events 

Detailed methods for respiratory event identification 
have been reported previously.17 In brief, estimated sleep time 
was identified when physiologic parameters were consistent 
with both sleep (eg, demonstrating little movement, reduced 
heart rate) and sleep-wake times recorded by the parent in the 
sleep diary. Respiratory events were scored if they were at least 
8 seconds long, which represents at least 2 missed respiratory 
cycles at this age. Obstructive apneas were scored when chest 
and abdominal efforts were asynchronous and estimated tidal 
volume was <25% baseline, irrespective of associated desaturation. 
Hypopneas were scored when respiratory efforts were accompanied 
by a 25% to 50% reduction in estimated tidal 
volume and accompanied by at least 3% oxyhemoglobin de-
saturation or when clearly discernible decreases in estimated 
tidal volume were associated with similar desaturation. Central 
apneas (absent effort in both channels) were excluded 
from SDB indexes. 

All records were scored without clinical correlates by 
scorers who regularly participated in scoring exercises to 
maintain interobserver consistency. We compared the obstructive 
apnea hypopnea index from the home study with a similarly 
defined index (obstructive apnea plus hypopneas 
associated with a 3% desaturation) from full channel laboratory-
based polysomnography (sleep staging, nasal-oral airflow, 
respiratory effort, oximetry, and electrocardiography) in 121 
children selected to represent a range of SDB findings. In the 
55 children in whom the two tests were performed within 3 
months, the mean obstructive apnea hypopnea index was 2.6 
± 8.0 and 2.9 ± 7.5 for laboratory versus home studies, respectively 
(intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.85). With the use 
of a threshold value for SDB of at least 5 events per hour, the 
sensitivity for SDB classification by home studies was 88% 
and specificity was 98%. These data support the overall accuracy 
of classification of SDB, based on the apnea hypopnea 
index derived from the home studies.

Definitions 

Children were categorized as “snorers” if the care giver 
answered “yes” to “ loud snoring” at least 1 to 2 times per week 
in the past month. Prior tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy was 
indicated by affirmative responses to individual questions 
about tonsils or adenoids being removed. Children were categorized 
as “sleepy” if the care giver reported that the child had 
fallen asleep in the past month “frequently” (3-4 times per 
week) or “always or almost always” (5-7 times per week) during 
any of the following activities (watching television, reading, 
eating, talking, at school, or playing). SDB was identified 
by using three definitions. The first used the obstructive apnea 
hypopnea index with a cutoff point of at least 5 events per 
hour of estimated sleep time. The second definition included 
only obstructive apneas regardless of desaturation with a cutoff 
point of at least 1 event per hour.19 The third definition 
combined children identified by either SDB criterion. 

Statistical Analysis 

Data were analyzed by means of SAS version 8.2 (SAS 
Institute, Inc, Cary, NC) for descriptive statistics, contingency 
tables, and unadjusted odds ratios. Two-sample t tests and 
Pearson .2 tests were conducted to compare means and proportions, 
respectively. Exact logistic regression was performed 
with the use of LogXact version 2.1 (Cytel Software, Cambridge, 
Mass) to identify the relation between race, obesity, 
prematurity, and SDB, adjusting for the other covariates. Associations 
between the risk factors and SDB were expressed as 
odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Sample estimates 
of SDB were stratified by prematurity and race: white/term, 
white/preterm, black/term, and black/preterm. Using standard 

formulas for stratified sampling, the stratum-specific estimates 
were combined to calculate overall prevalence estimates, based 
on weights from US live births data.20 Asian, Hispanic, Native 
American, or multiracial participants (“other” race) were 
excluded in these latter calculations. 

RESULTS 

A total of 850 (94%) of the CCSHS cohort had both 
questionnaire data and technically satisfactory home recordings 
(Table I). The mean gestational age of the former preterm 
participants was 31 ± 3 weeks, and 17% of the sample had 
birth weights <1000 g. Although the preterm sample was 
slightly younger, shorter, and weighed less, both groups were 
comparable with respect to race, sex, and obesity. Snoring and 
prior tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy were reported more 
commonly in the preterm group. Parents reported the following 
frequencies for common SDB symptoms: snoring (17%), 
falling asleep watching television (12%), and falling asleep in 
school (0.4%). 

Key sleep and breathing variables are summarized in 
Table II. The mean estimated sleep time based on the 
overnight study was 7.5 hours. SDB was identified in 2.5%, 
4.0%, and 4.7% of the children, defined by the apnea hypopnea 
index, the obstructive apnea index, or the combined definition, 
respectively. SDB was observed with an almost 3- to 
5-fold greater frequency in the preterm compared with the 
term group, depending on the SDB definition. The mean and 
nadir oxygen saturation values were minimally lower in the 
preterm group. 

By design, preterm status did not differ by race (46% in 
each racial group). More black children had body mass index

white/other [13%]; P = .0074) or above the 85th percentile 
(black [35%] versus white/other [26%]; P = .0035). Snoring 
was also more common in black compared with white/other 
children (24% vs 13%, P < .0001). Black children compared 
with white children were more likely to have SDB (4.8% vs 
1.0%, 8.1 vs 1.4%, or 8.7% vs 2.2%) for the apnea hypopnea 
index, the obstructive apnea index, or the combined definition, 
respectively (P = .0006, P < .0001, and P < .0001). 

The unadjusted odds ratios for each key covariate are 
shown in Table III. (The 39 children in the “other” race groups 
were excluded because they represented small, ethnically heterogeneous 
groups.) For all three SDB definitions, preterm 
gestation and black race were significant risk factors for SDB. 
Obesity was associated with SDB only when defined by the 
apnea hypopnea index. Male sex was not associated with any 
SDB definition. As expected, snoring was strongly associated 
with all SDB definitions. 

Table IV summarizes the results of logistic regression 
analyses after adjusting for significant covariates (race, 
preterm status, body mass index) from the unadjusted models 
(except snoring because of its close relation to SDB). For all 
SDB definitions, adjusted analyses showed race and preterm 
status each to be independent, significant risk factors, with 
odds ratios similar to the unadjusted models. Black children 
were 4 to 6 times more likely and former preterm children 
were 3 to 5 times more likely to have SDB compared with 
white and term children, respectively. Odds ratios for body 
mass index greater than either the 85th or 95th percentiles 
were not significant.

Using cohort-specific estimates with birth weight from 
US live births data for race and preterm status,20 we derived 
population prevalence estimates of 0.9% (95% CI = 0.4%1.3%), 
1.9% (95% CI = 1.0%-2.9%), and 2.2% (95% CI = 
1.2%-3.2%) for each definition (apnea hypopnea index, obstructive 
apnea index, combined), respectively. 

DISCUSSION 

This study presents fundamental epidemiologic data on 
childhood SDB, quantifying the prevalence of unrecognized 
SDB and the association of several putative risk factors with 
childhood SDB. We conducted objective cardiorespiratory 
monitoring during sleep in the largest population-based sample 
of US children that included substantial black representation. 
In addition, the targeted population had a high 
participation rate that minimized selection biases. We observed 
a wide spectrum of undiagnosed SDB in this cohort, 
ranging from a few episodes of apnea and hypopnea per night 
to severe apnea with respiratory events with desaturations >40 
times per hour. Using objective criteria, we estimated a prevalence 
rate of SDB up to 2.2% in 8- to 11-year-old children. 
We confirmed our previous reports of an increased SDB risk 
in black children8 and extended our findings to identify 
preterm status as a significant risk factor. This prevalence estimate 
was similar to previous reports that applied objective 
testing in small or less representative samples.6-10 

Preterm infants represent a growing proportion of all live 
births, comprising 10.3% of whites and 17.2% of blacks, respectively.
20 Although apnea is well recognized during the early 
months of life in preterm infants, little attention has been paid

to its persistence in later childhood. Former preterm children 
may be at increased risk for SDB, partly based on exposures in 
the perinatal environment, which influence the development of 
respiratory control13,14 or upper airway size.21,22 Although the 
risk of apnea appears to decrease with increasing postgestational 
age,23 recent data have shown persistence of apneas in some 
infants.18 Persistent apneas have been observed beyond 1 year 
of life in a subgroup of children followed after an apparent life-
threatening event.24 Of note, former preterm children had an 
increased frequency of prior tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy 
(Table I), suggesting greater problems with chronic adenotonsillar 
disease. Ongoing analyses of risk factors in the preterm 
group may further identify specific risk factors that may be operative 
in middle childhood. The recognition of preterm status 
as a risk factor for SDB suggests an opportunity for anticipatory 
screening for SDB in children who are otherwise at high risk 
for developmental delays and who may be more vulnerable to 
additive adverse effects of SDB. 

We previously observed a predisposition to SDB among 
black children who were mostly family members of adult 
probands with SDB.8 We now extend this observation to a 
population-based cohort of children. The current data from 
this population-based study underscores the increased suscep


tibility of black children to SDB. Black children are also at 
higher risk for socioeconomic disadvantage, more vulnerable 
to negative health outcomes associated with untreated SDB, 
and may benefit from more intensive screening for SDB by 
primary care providers. The basis for racial differences in SDB 
is not clear. Our previous work indicates that craniofacial risk 
factors for SDB differ between racial groups,25,26 as does the 
apparent mode of inheritance of SDB.27 The current data suggest 
that increased risk for SDB comes from more than obesity 
or prematurity. Understanding the basis for racial 
differences in SDB may provide new insights into underlying 
pathogenetic mechanisms. 

The relation between obesity and SDB was much weaker 
than observed in adults, varied with SDB definition, and 
was not significant in the adjusted models. Previous studies, 
including our own, have shown a relation between obesity and 
childhood SDB in nonclinical8 and clinical populations.28,29 
One explanation for this inconsistency was positive confounding 
from the relation between obesity and race in this cohort. 
However, adjusted models that excluded race but included 
preterm status and obesity also failed to show an effect from 
obesity. Although obesity may be a risk factor for childhood 
SDB, its effect is probably smaller than preterm status and

race and may not be consistently detected in a population-
based study with small numbers of highly affected children. 
The apnea hypopnea index that required desaturation to identify 
hypopnea suggested an obesity relation in the unadjusted 
model. Obese children may have gas exchange abnormalities 
related to the mechanical effects of obesity on the lungs but 
unrelated to upper airway obstruction. Previous estimates of 
SDB in children by means of metrics that required desaturation 
may have inflated obesity as a risk factor for SDB when 
desaturation-related events were attributed to upper airway 
obstruction. As expected from other pediatric studies, and in 
contrast to the adult experience with SDB, male sex was not 
associated with SDB in these prepubertal children.1 

There are several limitations in our findings. Our prevalence 
rate estimates may not be generalized to populations 
with sizeable Hispanic or Asian representation or applicable 
to children in other age groups. Specifically, we may have underestimated 
SDB in younger age groups in whom lymphoid 
hyperplasia may be a prominent risk factor for SDB or in 
teenagers in whom smoking, increasing obesity, and puberty 
in males may be additional risk factors. The relatively small 
number of “affected” children in our sample limited our ability 
to test for interactions among the risk factors such as race and 
preterm status. 

Another potential limitation was the use of unattended 
home cardiorespiratory monitoring instead of full laboratory-
based polysomnography. The choice of the limited cardiorespiratory 
equipment was consistent with the study goals of 
providing valid prevalence estimates of SDB rather than complete 
characterization of the clinical spectrum of childhood 
SDB. Nevertheless, our preliminary validation studies comparing 
in-laboratory full polysomnography to limited-channel 
home cardiorespiratory studies indicate excellent agreement.

Since more subtle measures of obstruction (eg, nasal or 
esophageal pressure), hypoventilation (end-tidal carbon dioxide), 
and sleep disruption (sleep state fragmentation and 
arousal) were not obtained, the prevalence of clinically important 
SDB may be higher. Thus, the current study should be 
viewed as a lower-limit estimate of prevalence for a wider 
group of disorders. 

Finally, our study used three different metrics to classify 
SDB in children. These metrics were similar to those recommended 
in clinical practice to describe the presence and severity 
of SDB and to make medical decisions about surgical 
treatment in clinical samples of children.1,12,30 However, we 
recognize the limited usefulness of these measurements alone 
as diagnostic criteria for a clinical disorder in the absence of 
data on negative health consequences such as daytime neurocognitive 
dysfunction (sleepiness, inattention, or poor 
school performance). The focus of this report was to describe 
the distribution of valid indexes of SDB from a clearly defined 
population-based sample of 8- to 11-year-old children rather 
than to characterize a clinical disorder. However, the clinical 
relevance of our findings is suggested by a higher frequency of 
snoring and sleepiness among the children who met our criteria 
for SDB [snoring (75%, 53%, and 55% vs 15% in the non-
DB group) and sleepiness (30%, 41%, and 34% vs 13% in the 
non-SDB group)] for the apnea-hypopnea, obstructive apnea, 
or combined definitions, respectively. 

In summary, the prevalence of SDB in 8- to 11-year-old 
children with the use of objective measures is lower than in 
adults but indicates that SDB is common in this relatively 
healthy population. Furthermore, our data suggest increased 
susceptibility to SDB among potentially vulnerable populations 
including preterm and black children. The extent to 
which unrecognized SDB, especially mild SDB, leads to im-

Description of Low-Birth Weight and Maternal 
Employment Study (LBW-MES) Cohort 

The original cohort from which the majority of children 
were recruited was a stratified (by prematurity) random sample 
of a birth cohort of 913 children born between 1988 and 1993 at 
three large Cleveland area hospitals who were enrolled between 
1993 and 1996 in the LBW-MES. The preterm sample was assembled 
by identifying all eligible cases from the newborn intensive 
care unit (NICU) admission records. We sequentially 
enrolled equal numbers of children who were 3, 4, and 5 years 
old at the time of initial recruitment for each of 5 consecutive 
birth years. Criteria for inclusion were (1) born <36 weeks’ gestation, 
(2) birth weight <2500 g, (3) birth weight appropriate for 
gestational age, (4) hospitalized in a Level III NICU for >1 
week, and (5) survival of the child. The term sample was assem


bled by using the newborn nursery records from the same three 
hospitals to identify term infants born in the same consecutive 
birth years as the preterm sample. Criteria for inclusion for the 
term sample were (1) born between 38 and 42 weeks’ gestation; 

(2) hospitalized in a normal newborn nursery; and (3) child was 
discharged home with the mother. In addition, when contacted 
for recruitment to the LBW/MES study at ages 3 to 6 years, 
children from the preterm or term samples were ineligible if developmental 
delays of >2 years were reported. Another inclusion 
criterion applied during initial assembly of the original cohort 
was the presence of two parents living in the home (n = 800, or 
86% of the original cohort). This condition was imposed to facilitate 
the collection of data on maternal employment relevant 
for the initial study hypotheses. However, a supplement to the 
study (from the Office of Research on Women’s Health) supported 
additional recruitment of 121 single-parent families who 
also were studied between 1993 and 1996.
