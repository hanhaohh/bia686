ABSTRACT 
Tonsillectomy 
and 
adenoidectomy 
(T&A) 
is 
a 
frequent 
surgical 
procedure 
in 
children 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
(OSA). 
Many 
symptomatic 
children 
who 
do 
not 
fulfill 
the 
currently 
recommended 
criteria 
for 
T&A 
may 
benefit 
from 
topical 
intranasal 
steroid 
therapy. 
However, 
the 
expression 
of 
glucocorticoid 
receptor 
(GCR) 
expression 
in 
adenoid 
and 
tonsillar 
tissue 
is 
currently 
unknown. 
The 
objective 
of 
this 
study 
was 
to 
assess 
and 
compare 
expression 
patterns 
of 
the 
human 
GCR 
in 
children 
who 
undergo 
T&A 
for 
either 
recurrent 
throat 
infections 
(RI) 
or 
OSA. 
Adenotonsillar 
tissues 
from 
36 
children 
with 
OSA 
or 
RI 
were 
subjected 
to 
quantitative 
PCR 
using 
specific 
primers 
for 
GCR-. 
and 
GCR-. 
and 
to 
immunohistochemistry 
and 
Western 
blotting 
for 
protein 
expression 
of 
GCR 
isoforms. 
mRNA 
encoding 
for 
expression 
of 
both 
GCR-. 
and 
GCR-. 
was 
detected 
in 
the 
tonsils 
and 
adenoids 
of 
all 
children, 
with 
markedly 
higher 
relative 
abundance 
of 
the 
GCR-. 
Furthermore, 
GCR-. 
mRNA 
expression 
was 
increased 
in 
OSA-derived 
adenoid 
and 
tonsil 
tissues 
compared 
with 
RI, 
whereas 
no 
differences 
emerged 
for 
GCR-. 
Immunoblots 
confirmed 
these 
findings 
for 
the 
protein 
transcripts 
of 
these 
genes, 
and 
immunohistochemistry 
showed 
a 
specific 
topographic 
pattern 
of 
distribution 
for 
both 
receptors 
in 
tonsillar 
tissue. 
GCR-. 
and 
GCR-. 
are 
expressed 
in 
pediatric 
adenotonsillar 
tissue, 
are 
more 
abundant 
in 
OSA 
patients, 
and 
demonstrate 
a 
specific 
topographic 
pattern 
of 
expression. 
These 
findings 
along 
with 
the 
high 
GCR-:GCR-. 
ratio 
suggest 
a 
favorable 
profile 
for 
topical 
steroid 
therapy 
in 
snoring 
children 
with 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy.

OSA, 
and 
clearly 
present 
with 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy 
may 
not 
fulfill 
the 
polysomnographic 
criteria 
that 
would 
support 
surgical 
treatment. 
Thus, 
these 
children 
are 
usually 
left 
unattended, 
even 
though 
a 
significant 
proportion 
may 
manifest 
neurocognitive 
and 
behavioral 
dysfunction 
(10–12). 


The 
use 
of 
corticosteroid 
therapy 
as 
a 
potential 
nonsurgical 
alternative 
in 
the 
management 
of 
OSA 
in 
children 
has 
been 
advanced 
by 
some 
investigators. 
Indeed, 
Brouillette 
et 
al. 
(13) 
initially 
showed 
that 
a 
short 
course 
of 
systemic 
prednisone 
was 
ineffective 
in 
modifying 
the 
size 
of 
either 
tonsillar 
or 
adenoid 
tissue, 
such 
that 
no 
changes 
in 
the 
polysomnographic 
abnormalities 
occurred. 
In 
contrast, 
a 
6-wk 
course 
of 
the 
topical 
steroid 
fluticasone 
markedly 
improved 
the 
severity 
of 
the 
gas 
exchange 
abnormalities 
during 
sleep 
in 
12 
children 
with 
OSA, 
whereas 
a 
mild 
but 
significant 
deterioration 
in 
those 
sleep 
measures 
emerged 
in 
the 
placebo-treated 
group 
(14). 
Furthermore, 
T&A 
was 
more 
likely 
prevented 
after 
sustained 
low-
dose 
treatment 
with 
nasal 
beclomethasone 
(24-wk 
duration), 
especially 
in 
those 
who 
showed 
improved 
symptoms 
after 
4

GLUCOCORTICOID 
RECEPTOR 
IN 
SLEEP 
APNEA 


(15), 
suggesting 
that 
the 
presence 
or 
absence 
of 
an 
initial 
response 
to 
steroids 
may 
be 
a 
major 
determinant 
of 
whether 
topical 
steroids 
have 
a 
role 
in 
the 
treatment 
of 
children 
with 
symptomatic 
snoring. 
Two 
human 
isoforms 
of 
glucocorticoid 
receptors 
(GCR) 
have 
been 
identified 
and 
termed 
GCR-. 
and 
GCR-. 
Both 
receptors 
originate 
from 
the 
same 
gene 
through 
alternative 
splicing, 
and 
in 
fact 
GCR-. 
may 
represent 
a 
decoy 
GCR 
and 
play 
a 
role 
in 
glucocorticoid 
ligand 
efficacy 
(16). 
Indeed, 
although 
reduced 
ligand 
binding 
to 
corticosteroids 
or 
defects 
in 
GCR 
translocation 
to 
the 
nucleus 
and 
binding 
to 
the 
glucocorticoid-binding 
response 
element 
can 
explain 
some 
cases 
of 
corticosteroid-resistant 
asthma 
(17), 
altered 
relationships 
in 
the 
expression 
of 
GCR-. 
and 
-. 
in 
lung 
tissue 
have 
emerged 
as 
the 
most 
likely 
and 
major 
determinant 
of 
corticosteroid 
insensitivity 
(18–22). 
We 
therefore 
conducted 
this 
study 
to 
assess 
whether 
GCR-. 
and 
GCR-. 
are 
expressed 
in 
tonsils 
and 
adenoids 
and 
to 
determine 
whether 
differences 
in 
expression 
of 
these 
receptors 
occur 
between 
children 
with 
OSA 
and 
those 
with 
RI. 


METHODS 


The 
study 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
University 
of 
Louisville 
Human 
Research 
Committee, 
and 
informed 
consent 
was 
obtained 
from 
the 
legal 
caregiver 
of 
each 
participant. 
Consecutive 
children 
who 
underwent 
tonsillectomy 
for 
either 
OSA 
or 
RI 
were 
identified 
before 
surgery 
and 
recruited 
into 
the 
study. 
The 
diagnosis 
of 
OSA 
syndrome 
was 
established 
by 
overnight 
polysomnography 
in 
the 
sleep 
laboratory 
and 
required 
the 
presence 
of 
apnea-hypopnea 
index 
5 
events/h 
of 
sleep 
(23). 
Patients 
who 
were 
referred 
for 
RI 
were 
selected 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
a 
history 
of 
at 
least 
five 
tonsillar 
infections 
in 
6 
mo, 
and 
because 
the 
absence 
of 
any 
symptoms 
suggestive 
of 
OSA 
essentially 
negates 
the 
presence 
of 
this 
condition 
(11), 
they 
were 
not 
evaluated 
by 
an 
overnight 
polysomnogram, 
because 
our 
questionnaire-based 
evaluation 
is 
highly 
sensitive 
and 
specific 
in 
ruling 
out 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
in 
children 
(11). 
For 
inclusion, 
children 
with 
RI 
were 
required 
to 
have 
received 
their 
last 
dose 
of 
antibiotic 
therapy 
6 
wk 
or 
longer 
from 
the 
day 
of 
surgery. 
Children 
who 
had 
known 
conditions 
such 
as 
asthma, 
allergic 
rhinitis, 
or 
history 
of 
allergies 
and/or 
had 
received 
corticosteroid 
or 
leukotriene 
modifier 
therapy 
within 
1 
y 
from 
surgery 
were 
excluded 
from

After 
both

were 
removed 
by 
a

specialist, 
a 
portion 
of 
each 
tissue 
was 
snap-frozen 
in 
liquid 
nitrogen 
and 
stored 
at 
80°C, 
and 
another 
portion 
was 
fixed 
in

with 
30%

and 
kept 
at

were 
present 
in 
body

among 
the 
two 
groups 
with 
only 
two 
children 
in 
each 
group 
fulfilling 
the 
criteria 
for 
obesity 
(body 
mass

95% 
for 
age 
and

As 
in 
many 
other 
tissues, 
GCR-. 
mRNA 
was 
markedly 
more 
abundant 
than 
GCR-. 
mRNA 
in 
both 
tonsils 
and 
adenoids. 
Furthermore, 
OSA 
patients 
consistently 
had 
higher 
GCR-. 
mRNA 
expression 
in 
upper 
airway 
lymphoid 
tissues 
when 
compared 
with 
those 
derived 
from 
children 
with 
RI 
(0.93

0.06 
versus 
0.70 
.

In 
contrast, 
no 
differences 
in 
GCR-. 
mRNA 
emerged 
in 
the 
two 
patient 
groups 
(1.27 
. 
0.13 
versus 
1.58 
. 
0.25; 
NS). 
In 
the 
palatine 
tonsils 
excised 
from 
OSA 
and 
RI 
patients, 
both 
GCR-. 
and 
GCR-. 
immunoreactivities 
were 
found 
and 
were 
located 
primarily 
within 
the 
epithelial 
layers 
and 
the 
extrafollicular 
areas 
within 
the 
parenchyma. 
No 
staining 
was 
detected 
in 
the 
tonsillar 
germinal 
centers 
(Fig. 
2). 
To 
compare 
between 
OSA 
and 
RI 
patients, 
we 
performed 
immunoblots 
of 
tonsillar 
and 
adenoidal 
tissue 
lysates 
for 
GCR-. 
and 
GCR-. 
The 
identity 
bands 
were 
confirmed 
using 
a 
neutralizing 
peptide 
that 
attenuated 
the 
intensity 
of 
the 
band 
at 
a 
molecular 
weight 
of 
94 
kd 
for 
GCR-. 
and 
90 
kd 
for 
GCR-. 
GCR-. 
protein 
expression 
was 
significantly 
greater 
in 
the 
OSA 
group 
compared 
with 
the 
RI 
group 
(n

DISCUSSION 


This 
study 
shows 
that 
both 
GCR-. 
and 
GCR-. 
mRNA 
transcripts 
and 
immunoreactivities 
are 
present 
and 
expressed 
in 
lymphoid 
tissues 
derived 
from 
the 
upper 
airways 
of 
children 
with 
either 
OSA 
or 
RI 
and 
that 
the 
overall 
abundance 
of 
GCR-. 
is 
substantially 
greater 
than 
that 
of 
GCR-. 
Furthermore, 
we 
show 
that 
GCR-. 
expression 
is 
greater 
in 
OSA 
patients 
compared 
with 
children 
with 
RI, 
whereas 
such 
differential 
expression 
is 
absent 
for 
GCR-. 


Recent 
studies 
have 
characterized 
the 
expression 
of 
GCR-. 
and 
GCR-. 
in 
several 
human 
tissues 
at 
both 
the 
gene 
and 
the 
protein 
levels 
(18,19,21,22,24–36). 
Although 
the 
two 
receptors 
were 
found 
and 
identified 
in 
both 
normal 
and 
inflamed 
human 
nasal 
mucosa 
leading 
to 
polyp 
formation 
(28,33), 
it 
seems 
that, 
as 
found 
in 
the 
present 
study, 
the 
relative 
abundance 
of 
GCR-. 
was 
markedly 
greater 
than 
that 
of 
GCR-. 
It 
is 
interesting 
that 
these 
studies 
found 
increased 
expression 
of 
GCR-. 
when 
the 
tissues 
exhibited 
inflammatory 
changes, 
and 
this 
pattern 
was 
particularly 
correlated 
to 
the 
number 
of 
mast 
cells 
present 
(33). 
The 
increased 
expression 
of 
GCR-. 
in 
nasal 
polyp 
inflammatory 
cells, 
particularly 
T 
cells 
and 
eosinophils, 
was 
associated 
with 
increased 
resistance 
to 
the 
suppression 
of 
inflammatory 
cell 
counts 
in 
the 
tissues 
by 
topical 
steroids 
(28). 
Despite 
clear 
differences 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
myeloperoxidase-expressing 
cells 
in 
OSA 
and 
RI 
upper 
airway 
lymphoid 
tissues, 
with 
markedly 
greater 
myeloperoxidase 
immunoreactivity 
found 
in 
OSA 
patients 
(data 
not 
shown), 
GCR-. 
expression 
but 
not 
GCR-. 
expression 
was 
increased 
in 
OSA. 
These 
findings 
suggest 
that 
despite 
the 
presence 
of 
inflammatory 
processes 
most 
probably 
triggered 
by 
the 
presence 
of 
mechanical 
vibration 
in 
the 
upper 
airway 
lymphoid 
tissue 
during 
snoring, 
the 
resultant 
increase 
in 
the 
number 
of 
inflammatory 
cell 
numbers 
does 
not 
adversely 
affect 
the 
putative 
therapeutic 
response 
profile 
of 
these 
tissues 
(as 
might 
be 
anticipated 
if 
increased 
GCR-. 
had 
been 
found) 
but 
rather 
suggest 
a 
favorable 
likeli

hood 
that 
reductions 
in 
adenoid 
and 
tonsillar 
tissue 
mass 
will 
occur 
in 
response 
to 
the 
intranasal 
application 
of 
topical 
steroids 
(35). 


The 
mechanisms 
associated 
with 
the 
differentially 
increased 
expression 
of 
GCR-. 
in 
OSA 
tonsils 
and 
adenoids 
are 
currently 
unknown. 
As 
mentioned 
above, 
there 
is 
increasing 
evidence 
that 
inflammatory 
processes 
are 
activated 
and 
perpetuated 
in 
the 
retropalatal 
region 
and 
pharyngeal 
introitus 
by 
the 
presence 
of 
snoring 
and 
repeated 
upper 
airway 
occlusions 
as 
seen 
in 
OSA 
(37–39). 
It 
therefore 
is 
possible 
that 
the 
increased 
release 
of 
inflammatory 
mediators 
such 
as 
cytokines 
in 
the 
upper 
airways 
of 
snoring 
children 
(but 
not 
in 
children 
with 
RI) 
may 
play 
a 
role 
in 
the 
regulation 
of 
GRC-. 
gene 
expression 
(40). 
However, 
we 
cannot 
rule 
out 
the 
possibility 
that 
the 
inverse 
may 
occur, 
i.e. 
that 
the 
expression 
of 
GRC-. 
may 
be 
down-regulated. 
Notwithstanding 
such 
eventuality, 
the 
presence 
of 
episodic 
hypoxia 
in 
OSA 
could 
also 
contribute 
to 
the 
discrepant 
expression 
of 
GRC-. 
and 
GCR-. 
in 
patients 
with 
OSA. 
Indeed, 
induction 
of 
hypoxia-related 
transcription 
factors 
could 
interact 
with 
GRC-dependent 
transcriptional 
regulation 
and 
affect 
the 
expression 
of 
downstream 
target 
genes, 
including 
GRC-. 
(41). 


A 
substantial 
number 
of 
topical 
corticosteroid 
preparations 
are 
widely 
used 
in 
the 
treatment 
of 
asthma 
and 
allergic 
rhinitis 
in 
children. 
However, 
the 
implications 
of 
these 
compounds 
for 
the 
clinical 
treatment 
of 
children 
with 
sleep 
apnea 
primarily 
attributable 
to 
enlarged 
adenotonsillar 
tissue 
remains 
unknown 
and 
clearly 
merits 
further 
investigation. 
The 
cloning 
of 
GCR 
and 
generation 
of 
isoform-specific 
antibodies 
that 
specifically 
recognize 
GCRs 
enabled 
us 
to 
explore 
the 
levels 
of 
gene 
and 
protein 
expression 
in 
tonsillar 
and 
adenoid 
tissues 
of 
children. 
We 
could 
not 
obtain 
such 
tissues 
from 
normal 
children 
for 
obvious 
ethical 
reasons 
and 
therefore 
are 
precluded 
from 
comparing 
expression 
levels 
in 
children 
who 
are 
devoid 
of 
any 
medical 
history. 
Nevertheless, 
current 
findings 
indicate 
that 
both 
GCRs 
are 
expressed 
in 
human 
tonsils 
and 
adenoids 
and 
that 
different 
conditions 
such 
as 
RI 
and 
OSA 
alter 
the 
patterns 
of 
expression 
in 
these 
tissues, 
particularly 
that 
of 
GRC-.We 
postulate 
that 
the 
increased 
expression 
of 
GRC-. 
in 
OSA 
may 
reflect 
a 
consequence 
rather 
than 
a 
cause 
in 
the 
pathophysiologic 
mechanisms 
that 
link 
the 
enlargement 
of 
the 
lymphoid 
tissue 
in 
the 
upper 
airway 
to 
the 
emergence 
of 
sleep 
apnea 
in 
snoring 
children. 
Surprising, 
lower 
expression 
levels 
were 
present 
in 
children 
with 
recurrently 
infected 
tonsils 
considering 
that 
these 
children 
sustain 
episodic 
infectious 
processes 
in 
their 
tonsils. 
However, 
it 
should 
be 
stressed 
that 
surgical 
removal 
of 
the 
tissues 
was 
performed 
in 
children 
with 
RI 
only 
during 
periods 
of 
quiescence 
in 
which 
no 
evidence 
for 
any 
ongoing 
inflammatory 
processes 
was 
present. 


In 
summary, 
we 
have 
delineated 
the 
patterns 
of 
expression 
and 
tissue 
distribution 
of 
GRC-. 
and 
GCR-. 
in 
developing 
human 
tonsils 
and 
adenoids 
and 
shown 
that 
these 
receptors 
are 
regulated 
differentially 
in 
two 
frequent 
disease 
conditions 
that 
lead 
to 
the 
need 
for 
their 
surgical 
removal, 
namely 
RI 
and 
OSA. 
The 
cumulative, 
albeit 
very 
preliminary 
evidence, 
suggests 
a 
favorable 
response 
profile 
to 
the 
use 
of 
topical 
steroids 
in 
OSA 
and 
the 
likely 
absence 
of 
corticosteroid 
insensitivity 
when 
considering 
the 
GRC-. 
and 
GCR-. 
expression 
ratios 


found 
in 
this 
study. 
Thus, 
randomized 
controlled 
trials 
of 
intranasal 
steroids 
should 
be 
conducted 
in 
children 
who 
have 
symptomatic 
snoring 
with 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy 
to 
delineate 
better 
the 
role, 
response 
pattern 
as 
a 
function 
of 
GCR 
expression, 
and 
optimal 
duration 
of 
this 
therapeutic 
modality.
