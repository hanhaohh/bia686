Objective: 
To 
determine 
the 
association 
between 
body 
position 
and 
obstructive 
events 
during 
sleep 
as 
determined 
by 
polysomnography 
(PSG) 
in 
very 
young 
children 
(age, 


3 
years) 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
syndrome. 
Design: 
Retrospective 
chart 
review. 


Subjects: 
Children 
aged 
3 
years 
and 
younger 
who 
underwent 
PSG 
to 
evaluate 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
and 
subsequentlyunderwent 
adenotonsillectomy 
between 
December 
1, 
2000, 
and 
November 
30, 
2003, 
were 
included 
in 
the 
study. 
The 
PSGs 
were 
analyzed 
for 
data 
on 
the 
respiratory 
disturbance 
index 
(RDI), 
time 
spent 
in 
each 
body 
position,
numberofapneiceventsineachposition,oxygensaturation, 
and 
time 
spent 
in 
each 
stage 
of 
sleep. 
The 
results 
determined 
the 
statistical 
significance 
of 
these 
parameters. 


Results: 
Sixty 
patients 
satisfied 
the 
criteria 
for 
inclusion 
in 
the 
study. 
The 
mean 
supine 
sleep 
RDI 
was 
8.5 


compared 
with 
4.9 
for 
the 
mean 
nonsupine 
sleep 
RDI. 
The 
mean 
RDI 
increased 
from 
5.6 
to 
8.5 
when 
more 
than 
50% 
of 
the 
time 
was 
spent 
in 
supine 
sleep. 
There 
was 
a 
further 
increase 
to 
10.5 
when 
supine 
sleep 
increased 
to 
75% 
of 
the 
total 
sleep 
time. 
The 
mean 
RDI 
in 
rapid 
eye 
movement 
sleep 
was 
20.5 
compared 
with 
5.3 
in 
non– 
rapid 
eye 
movement 
sleep. 
The 
mean±SD 
supine 
sleep 
RDI 
was 
18.5±5.1, 
and 
the 
mean 
nonsupine 
RDI 
was 
7.2±1.9, 
which 
was 
statistically 
significant 
(P=.02). 


Conclusions: 
There 
is 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
RDI 
with 
increased 
time 
spent 
in 
supine 
sleep 
in 
very 
young 
children 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea. 
Inadequate 
time 
spent 
in 
that 
position 
may 
lead 
to 
an 
underestimation 
of 
the 
severity 
of 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea. 
A 
combination 
of 
reduced 
rapid 
eye 
movement 
sleep 
and 
increased 
nonsupine 
sleep 
may 
invalidate 
the 
findings 
of 
PSG 
in 
these 
children.

EDIATRIC 
OBSTRUCTIVE 
SLEEP 
apnea 
syndrome 
(OSAS) 
is 
characterized 
by 
partial 
or 
complete 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
that 
occurs 
during 
sleep. 
It 
has 
been 
extensively 
researched 
in 
adults. 
The 
pathophysiologic 
features 
and 
most 
of 
the 
contributing 
factors 
of 
OSAS 
are 
well 
known. 
The 
syndrome 
affects 
between 
2% 
and 
4% 
of 
middle-aged 
adults, 
with 
supine 
sleep 
contributing 
to 
the 
symptoms. 
A 
study 
by 
Cartwright 
et 
al1 
shows 
that 
in 
adult 
patients 
there 
is 
a 
significant 
decrease 
in 
OSAS 
episodes 
when 
the 
supine 
position 
is 
avoided. 
However, 
the 
entity 
is 
not 
as 
well 
understood 
in 
children. 
Some 
studies 
have 
reported 
that 
sleep 
position 
does 
not 
affect 
the 
severity 
of 
OSAS 
in 
children.2 
It 
has 
also 
been 
suggested 
that 
children 
breathe 
better 
when 
they 
sleep 
in 
the 
supine 
position. 
Decreased 
time 
in 
a 
position 
in 
which 
most 
obstructive 
events 
occur 
could 
result 
in 
underreporting 
of 
the 
disorder 
in 
children. 
Although 
most 
studies 
were 
performed 
in 
the 
pediatric 
age 
group, 
to 
our 
knowledge 
none 
of 
them 
looked 
at 
very 
young 


children. 
The 
purpose 
of 
the 
present 
study 
was 
to 
evaluate 
the 
effect 
of 
body 
position 
on 
OSAS 
as 
diagnosed 
by 
polysomnography 
(PSG) 
in 
children 
younger 
than 
3 
years. 


METHODS
The 
study 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
institutional 
review 
board 
and 
the 
Committee 
for 
the 
Protection 
of 
Human 
Subjects 
of 
The 
University 
of 
Texas

at 
Houston. 
Sixty 
sleep 
studies 
performed 
at 
the 
Memorial 
Hermann 
Hospital 
Sleep 
Disorders 
Center, 
Houston, 
were 
reviewed. 
The 
study 
population 
included 
patients 
3 
years 
of 
age 
and 
younger 
evaluatedwithPSGbetweenDecember2001and 
December 
2003. 
Clinical 
characteristics 
of 
the 
patients 
were 
documented 
from 
their 
clinic 
charts. 
The 
clinical 
impression 
of 
the 
primary 
otolaryngologist 
was 
recorded, 
including 
a 
gradingofadenotonsillarhypertrophy.
Datarecorded 
from 
the 
sleep 
studies 
included 
age, 
sex, 
total 
sleep 
time, 
time 
spent 
in 
supine

RESULTS
In 
the 
60 
sleep 
studies 
reviewed, 
the 
mean±SD 
RDI 
score 


was 
10.8±3.4(Figure 
1). 
The 
mean±SD 
total 
sleep 
time 


was 
6.5 
± 
1.9 
hours, 
with 
an 
average 
of 
40% 
in 
the 


supine 
position. 
There 
was 
a 
statistically 
significant 
dif


ference 
(paired 
t50=2.6; 
P=.01) 
in 
the 
RDI 
(13.5) 
of 


children 
in 
the 
supine 
position 
when 
compared 
with 
the 


RDI 
(10.8) 
of 
children 
when 
all 
positions 
were 
in


cluded. 
Also, 
analysis 
revealed 
that 
as 
supine 
sleep 
de


tations 
result 
from 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy, 
most 
of 
them 
have 
been 
shown 
to 
be 
reversed 
by 
adenotonsillectomy.
4 
In 
1998, 
Wang 
et 
al5 
reported 
that 
enuresis 
is 
the 
clinical 
entity 
that 
most 
accurately 
predicts 
OSAS 
on 


PSGs. 
Other 
signs 
and 
symptoms 
of 
the 
disorder 
may 
be 


less 
reliable 
predictors 
of 
OSAS 
as 
diagnosed 
by 
PSG. 


Symptoms 
such 
as 
snoring 
and 
daytime 
somnolence 
may 


actually 
represent 
other 
conditions, 
eg, 
primary 
snoring 


or 
upper 
airway 
resistance 
syndrome. 


The 
results 
of 
our 
study 
indicate 
that 
supine 
sleep 
does 


creases 
when 
compared 
with 
percentage 
of 
total 
sleep 


time, 
the 
RDI 
decreases. 
The 
percentages 
of 
supine 
sleep 


for 
varying 
values 
were 
compared 
using 
t 
test 
analysis. 


For 
patients 
with 
supine 
sleep 
greater 
than 
50% 
of 
total 


sleep 
time, 
there 
was 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
RDI, 
although 


the 
increase 
was 
not 
statistically 
significant 
(P.05). 
Rapid 


eye 
movement 
sleep 
also 
correlated 
with 
an 
increased 
RDI 


(20.5) 
compared 
with 
non-REM 
results 
(5.6) 
(Figure 
2). 
The 
most 
significant 
finding 
in 
the 
study 
was 
that 
the 
RDI 


in 
the 
supine 
position 
was 
greater 
than 
in 
all 
other 
po


sitions 
combined 
(prone, 
left 
lateral 
decubitus, 
and 
right 


correlate 
with 
an 
increase 
in 
RDI 
as 
well 
as 
with 
OSAS 


in 
pediatric 
patients 
younger 
than 
3 
years. 
This 
finding 


is 
in 
contrast 
to 
previous 
studies 
that 
have 
demon


strated 
no 
correlation 
between 
sleep 
position 
and 
OSAS 


in 
children.2 
In 
2001, 
Penzel 
et 
al6 
demonstrated 
the 
col


lapsibility 
of 
the 
upper 
airways 
in 
adults 
who 
were 
in 
the 


supine 
position 
and 
showed 
that 
this 
outcome 


depended 
on 
sleep 
position 
and 
not 
on 
sleep 
stage. 
How


ever, 
adult 
sleep 
apnea 
differs 
from 
pediatric 
apnea 
in 
sev


eral 
aspects, 
and 
the 
exact 
mechanism 
of 
pediatric 
OSAS 


has 
not 
been 
fully 
elucidated. 
A 
recent 
study 
suggested 


that 
children 
younger 
than 
10 
years 
actually 
breathe 
bet-

The

COMMENT
Obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
syndrome 
is 
a 
serious 
medical 
problem, 
affecting 
500 
000 
children 
per 
year 
in 
the 
United 
States. 
Pediatric 
OSAS 
peaks 
between 
the 
ages 
of 
2 
and 
5 
years, 
with 
an 
overall 
prevalence 
of 
2%.3 
The 
hallmarks 
of 
OSAS 
include 
episodes 
of 
partial 
or 
complete 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
that 
occur 
during 
sleep, 
manifested 
by 
snoring, 
retractions, 
paradoxical 
chest 
motion, 
cyanosis, 
and 
poor 
quality 
of 
sleep. 
The 
condition 


the 
supine 
position 
compared 
with 
other 
positions. 
Our 
study 
in 
very 
young 
children 
showed 
evidence 
to 
the 
contrary. 
Our 
observations 
suggest 
that 
toddlers 
have 
sleep 
characteristics 
that 
are 
different 
from 
those 
of 
older 
children. 
Sleep 
studies 
may 
have 
to 
take 
these 
age 
group 
differences 
into 
consideration 
before 
declaring 
the 
findings 
adequate 
for 
interpretation. 
Very 
few 
infants 
were 
included 
in 
our 
study, 
and 
we 
did 
not 
specifically 
look 
at 
the 
breathing 
parameters 
in 
this 
age 
group. 
Therefore, 
we 
cannot 
comment 
on 
the 
relevance 
of 
our 
findings 
to 
the 
practice 
of 
putting 
infants 
to 
sleep 
on 
their 
backs 
to 
avoid 
sudden 
infant 
death 
syndrome.

Pediatric 
OSAS 
is 
most 
commonly 
caused 
by 
enlarged 
tonsils 
and 
adenoids, 
with 
increased 
symptoms 
during 
REM 
sleep, 
and 
the 
patients 
usually 
have 
an 
excellent 
response 
to 
adenotonsillectomy. 
It 
is 
thus 
imperative 
that 
clinicians 
who 
use 
PSG 
take 
into 
consideration 
the 
variables 
that 
may 
affect 
the 
validity 
of 
the 
results. 
Our 
study 
findings 
suggest 
that 
an 
inadequate 
amount 
of 
time 
in 
REM 
sleep 
and 
the 
supine 
position 
may 
result 
in 
the 
underdiagnosis 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
in 
very 
young 
children. 
Lack 
of 
adequate 
supine 
sleep 
may 
be 
an 
important 
factor 
in 
symptomatic 
children 
with 
normal 
sleep 
study 
results. 
It 
also 
raises 
significant 
questions 
about 
using 
PSGs 
as 
the 
“gold 
standard” 
for 
the 
diagnosis 
and 
management 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
in 
children. 
A 
larger 
number 
of 
patients 
may 
be 
required 
to 
validate 
our 
observations.
