Study Objectives: Inadequate sleep and sleep disordered breathing 
(SDB) can impair learning skills. Questionnaires used to evaluate sleepiness 
in adults are usually inadequate for adolescents. We conducted a 
study to evaluate the performance of a Spanish version of the Pediatric 
Daytime Sleepiness Scale (PDSS) and to assess the impact of sleepiness 
and SDB on academic performance.

Design: A cross-sectional survey of students from 7 schools in 4 cities 
of Argentina.

Measurements: A questionnaire with a Spanish version of the PDSS was 
used. Questions on the occurrence of snoring and witnessed apneas were 
answered by the parents. Mathematics and language grades were used 
as indicators of academic performance.

Participants: The sample included 2,884 students (50% males; age: 13.3 
± 1.5 years) 

Results: Response rate was 85%; 678 cases were excluded due to missing 
data. Half the students slept <9 h per night on weekdays. The mean 
PDSS value was 15.74 ± 5.93. Parental reporting of snoring occurred in 
511 subjects (23%); snoring was occasional in 14% and frequent in 9%. 
Apneas were witnessed in 237 cases (11%), being frequent in 4% and 
occasional in 7%. Frequent snorers had higher mean PDSS scores than 
occasional or nonsnorers (18 ± 5, 15.7 ± 6 and 15.5 ± 6, respectively; P 
< 0.001). Reported snoring or apneas and the PDSS were significant univariate 
predictors of failure and remained significant in multivariate logistic 
regression analysis after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, specific 
school attended, and sleep habits. 

Conclusions: Insufficient hours of sleep were prevalent in this population. 
The Spanish version of the PDSS was a reliable tool in middle–school-
aged children. Reports of snoring or witnessed apneas and daytime 
sleepiness as measured by PDSS were independent predictors of poor 
academic performance.

INTRODUCTION

SEVERAL REPORTS SUGGESTS THAT ADOLESCENTS 
NEED MORE THAN 8 HOURS OF SLEEP PER NIGHT.1,2 
HOWEVER, ADOLESCENTS OBTAIN LESS SLEEP THAN 
required. Some studies have shown that social activities and other 
behavioral patterns often shape adolescents’ lifestyles toward predominantly 
nighttime behavior, while school schedules require 
them to be fully awake early in the morning. This interaction leads 
to reduced weekday sleep time and a persistent sleep debt. In a 
nationwide study in New Zealand, 21% of respondents felt they 
were not getting enough sleep.3

Reduction of nighttime sleep due to reduced or altered sleep 
schedules has been associated with excessive sleepiness and impaired 
school performance.4-6 For example, it is known that during 
adolescence, circadian phase delays are often out of phase with 
academic schedules producing an increased risk for sleepiness, 
reduced academic performance, and other significant morbidity. 
Physiological studies have also shown that adequate sleep may be 
important for the consolidation of memory which could have important 
implications for school success in adolescence.7,8 Wagner 
et al reported that a night of adequate sleep after being exposed 
to complex mathematical problems more than doubles the likelihood 
that the student will come up with a novel solution to the 
problems posed in class, compared with students with reduced 
sleep.9 In poor sleepers, the risk of failing one or more years at 
school is double that of normal controls.10 Similarly, in a study on 
sleep patterns and daytime functioning in 3,000 children, students 
with lower grades reported later bedtimes on school nights and 
increased weekend delays of sleep onset.11 Thus, there is increasing 
evidence that sleep loss and resulting excessive sleepiness 
due to reduced time in bed, poor sleep quality, or variable sleep 
schedules is associated with impaired academic performance.12,13 
However, this association can potentially be bidirectional as poor 
academic performance may adversely affect sleep through concomitant 
stress or other mechanisms. 

In addition to insufficient sleep, sleep disordered breathing 
(SDB) ranging from primary snoring to obstructive sleep apnea 
syndrome, affects 10% to 25% of children between 3 and 12 years 
and may also contribute to poor academic performance.12,14-18 For

example, SDB is associated with behavioral dysfunctions including 
aggression, impulsiveness and decreased attention.19-21 Additionally, 
children with SDB display lower IQ scores and lower 
scores on tests of memory and other executive functions.22 Both 
reduced sleep and frequent oxygen desaturations likely contribute 
to these negative outcomes.23

Given the high prevalence and important consequences of 
sleep loss and sleep disorders in adolescents, there is a clear need 
for readily available and sensitive measures of sleepiness for use 
with adolescents. Specifically, the ability to easily assess the relative 
degree of sleepiness in this age group may improve the identification 
of at-risk individuals and help track treatment progress 
over time. In adolescent research settings, subjective measure of 
sleepiness may complement objective methods and can provide 
valuable information when time consuming objective assessment 
may not be feasible, However, questionnaires used to evaluate excessive 
sleepiness associated with sleep disorders and insufficient 
sleep in adults may be inadequate for younger populations.

Recently, a validated measure for sleepiness in children was 
introduced: the Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale (PDSS). Using 
this scale, daytime sleepiness was found to be related to lower 
school grades and other negative school-related outcomes.13 The 
present study was conducted to evaluate sleep habits and the value 
of the PDSS in a Spanish-speaking population of different cities 
in Argentina. To our knowledge no previous studies have tested 
foreign languages versions of this scale, and there were no studies 
exploring SDB and its impact on sleepiness as measured by the 
PDSS. We set out to investigate if self-reported sleepiness as measured 
as the PDSS is related to academic performance. The association 
between SDB and academic performance was also examined. 

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Sample Population

The survey was conducted between May and November of 
2004. Seven schools from four cities in Argentina participated 
in the study. This comprised a sample of adolescents from urban 
areas in Argentina predominantly between 10 and 15 years old. 
All the schools had similar socioeconomic status, representing a 
middle class background. We enrolled males and females students 
in their last grades of primary school and first 2 years of secondary 
school (between 9 and 17 years old).

Procedures 

The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board 
at Austral University. A questionnaire including the PDSS (see 
below) was administered to all participants in each of the seven 
schools. The questionnaire was presented to the students in a classroom 
setting after consent had been obtained from the parents and 
the school authorities. The students were free to answer the questionnaire 
or not at their own discretion. Every child participating 
in the survey was provided with a questionnaire to be completed 
by their parents. With parental consent, the school provided actual 
grades for language and mathematics achieved by each student 
for the current trimester. Academic failure was defined as a grade 
below 70% (7/10), which is considered insufficient for promotion 
to the next grade level.

Measures

The PDSS is an 8-item questionnaire developed to measure excessive 
sleepiness in younger school age populations,13 which was 
translated into Spanish and tested for comprehension (Appendix). 
Scores ranged from 0 to 32. Mean score values in the original study 
were 15.3 ± 6.2. Higher scores indicate greater sleepiness. 

Sleep hours during the week and weekend were evaluated using 
Likert-scale specific questions (response options: >10 h, 8-10 
h, 6-8 h, 4-6 h and <4 h). Nap time during the week and weekend 
was also assessed (response options: no nap, 15-30 min, 30-45 
min, 45-60 min, and >60 min). 

The parental questionnaire included questions on the presence 
and frequency of snoring and witnessed apneas in the child. Snoring 
was ascertained by the questions “Does your children snore?” 
(Yes, no or don’t know), and “If yes, how many times per week?” 
One or two times per week, three to four, five to six, and every 
night were the possible answers. Apneas were evaluated through 
the questions “Have you ever seen that breathing during sleep 
is irregular or interrupted?” (Yes, no or don’t know). The same 
categories used for snoring were used for apnea frequency. Reported 
snoring or apneas more than three nights per week were 
considered as frequent.24 Gender, height and weight data were 
also collected. Overweight and obesity were defined according 
to the international normality ranges proposed by Cole for Body 
Mass Index (BMI).25 

Statistical Analysis

Data are presented using frequencies, means and medians according 
to the distribution of the data. .2 and ANOVA tests were 
used for univariate comparisons and logistic regression modeling 
for multivariate analysis. Cronbach’s a was used for correlation between 
items of the PDSS scale. For the outcome of failure in mathematics 
and literature, all other collected variables were treated as 
predictors in logistic regression analyses. Statistical analysis was 
performed using SPSS 13 software (Chicago, Il, USA) 

RESULTS

The target population comprised 3,393 students. Of these, 509 
(15%) were absent from school on the day of the survey and 2,884 
students agreed to participate in the study. In 674 cases (23%) information 
on key variables was missing (including 281 cases of parents 
who answered “don’t know” in the question about apneas) and 
they were excluded from analysis. The final study sample included 
2,210 subjects. Population features are shown in Table 1. Excluded 
subjects were older, had higher BMIs and had poorer mathematics 
grades (P < 0.05 for all). On the contrary, no differences were found 
regarding to the PDSS, academic failure rates, week and weekend 
sleep hours and snoring and witnessed apnea rates.

Internal consistency (Cronbach’s a) and inter-item correlation 
of the PDSS scale in the full sample were 0.74 and 0.26, respectively. 
When the samples from each school were evaluated individually, 
Cronbach’s a values ranged from 0.72 to 0.81. Values 
for the original publication were 0.813

Information on sleep habits is shown in Figure 1. Forty-nine 
percent of subjects reported sleeping less than 8 h on weeknights 
while 83% slept less than 8 h per night during weekends. Snoring 
was reported by 511 subjects (23%). Witnessed apneas were

reported in 237 cases (11%) (Table 1). Figure 2 depicts the distribution 
of PDSS values.

Mean PDSS scores were higher for snorers than nonsnorers 
(16.6 ± 5.9 vs.15.5 ± 5.9; P< 0.001) indicating more sleepiness 
in this group. PDSS was also higher in older subjects (9-12 y: 
14.7±6.1, 12-15 y: 15.7±5.9 and 12-17 y: 16.6±5.7, P<0.003, 
Table 2). On the contrary, no significant differences were found 
regarding the severity of snoring or witnessed apneas (Table 2)

BMI, BMI z-score and frequency of overweight and obesity 
were significantly different among snoring categories. Snorers 
had lower mean grades in mathematics (6.4 ± 1.6 vs. 6.8 ± 1.6, P 
<0.001) and language (6.7 ± 1.5 vs. 7.0 ± 1.4; P< 0.001). PDSS, 
mathematics and language grades, as well as the proportion of 
failures of frequent snorers were also significantly different from 
occasional snorers (Figure 3).

To explore the relationship between sleepiness and academic 
results we segregated the sample into quartiles of PDSS values 
(1st quartile: <12, n = 661; 2nd quartile: 13-16, n = 500, 3rd quartile: 
17-20, n = 548 and 4th quartile: = 21, n = 501). Average grades for 
mathematics and language showed significant differences among 
groups (nonsnorers, occasional and frequent snorers) in each 
quartile, especially at the highest ones (Figure 3).

In the univariate analyses, the presence of snoring and apneas 
was associated with failure in mathematics and language. PDSS 
was associated with academic failure in both mathematics and 
language, i.e. each point of increase in the scale was associated 
with a 5% increase in risk for failure. (Table 4).

The association between snoring and apneas with academic 
failure in mathematics and language remained significant regardless 
of the specific school considered, PDSS, BMI z-score, age, 
gender, and sleep hours during the week. The association between 
PDSS values and academic failure in mathematics and language 
remained significant after adjusting for the presence of snoring or 
apneas as well as BMI z- score age, gender, attending a specific 
school, and sleep hours on weekdays (Table 4). Weekend sleep 
was excluded from the model because it showed no statistical significance 
in univariate analysis.

DISCUSSION

The main findings of this study were: adolescents suffered from 
insufficient sleep; the Spanish version of the PDSS scale was a reliable 
tool in middle–school-aged children; and report of snoring 
or witnessed apneas, on one hand, and daytime sleepiness on the 
other, were independent predictors of poor academic performance.

Lack of adequate sleep time was prevalent in our results as 
found in other studies2. In fact, 49% and 83% of the sample reported 
getting less than 8 hours of sleep per night on weekdays 
and weekends, respectively. Insufficent sleep, especially on weekends 
was common in this population. Thus a substantial portion 
of the relationship between sleepiness and academic performance 
in this sample is likely to be due to self-imposed lack of sleep. 
Studies on U.S. adolescents show that sleep debt comes from loss 
of sleep on weeknights, with compensation on weekends.2,4,11,19 
In our sample, sleep debt was mainly produced on the weekends, 
probably reflecting a more active nighttime lifestyle in this 
population and possibly a lower priority for sleep. In this setting, 
sleep debt is likely to be produced by leisure activities, and the 
direction of causality is likely unidirectional. Whether weekday 
insufficient sleep is also caused by leisure activities remains to be 
further examined.

The Spanish version of the PDSS scale was comparable to the 
original version, as the mean values were similar to those in the 
original work. Further, its internal consistency was also similar 
to the value initially reported.13 No reference values have been 
described for this scale, and it has not been previously applied to 
a sleep disordered population, so these results can be considered 
a first step in that direction. However, children with higher PDSS 
scores had lower average mathematics and language grades, suggesting 
sensitivity to an important real-world outcome. Indeed, 
the PDSS was a powerful predictor of failure, as each point of 
increase of the scale was associated with a 5% increase of risk for 
failure. This association remained significant after adjusting for 
potential confounding factors such as age, sex, school, and BMI. 
Results also remained significant after adjusting for the amount of 
sleep during weekdays.

In the present study, a small number (3%) of adolescents were 
obese, while 15% were overweight. These results are similar to 
the 4.6% obesity prevalence reported in previous studies among 
Latin American children26 and are also in agreement with a survey 
conducted in Argentine adolescents, which found that 10.9% 
of students were overweight and 2.2% were obese.27 We found 
that parents reported hearing their child snore in 23% of cases 
and witnessed apneas in 10%, a finding in line with previous 
published observations.14 In a recent community-based sample 
Johnson et al found that more than 20% of adolescents snored 
at least a few nights per month, and 6% snored every night or 
nearly every night. Apnea-like symptoms affected 2.5% to 6.1% 
of the sample.28 Although reporting of apneas was slightly higher 
in our study than other studies of younger populations, the present 
results are consistent with the 10%-23% of prevalence of an 
apnea/hypopnea index >5 reported in young adults.24 It must be 
noted that there are no epidemiological studies of the prevalence 
of apnea using objective measurements in adolescents.

Though frequent snoring was associated with poor academic 
performance, the presence of witnessed apneas had the highest 
correlation with academic failure, similar to other studies.29,30

Our study has several limitations. Our design does not allow 
temporal inference, thus limiting discussions of causality. In any 
study dealing with prevalence data, selection bias is also a concern. 
However the demographics results are similar to previous 
studies.27 The study was done in urban schools of middle class socioeconomic 
status. Sleep habits can be different in a rural setting 
as farm-related chores early in the morning can affect bedtime 
schedules or in other settings with markedly different socioeconomic 
status. Recall bias can affect reports of snoring and apnea 
by parents. However, it is interesting to note that even assuming 
that most of our subjects slept in a different room from their 
parents, the proportion of reported snoring and apneas was close 
to the findings of other studies.10,13,31 Other possible limitations 
include the broad age range of the sample, lack of data on pubertal 
status, recall bias on adolescent perception of sleep time, 
and the potential effect of sample size that might lead to spurious 
results. The PDSS scale has not yet been validated using objective 
methods (e.g., the multiple sleep latency test) and we were 
not able to obtain objective evaluation of sleep in our sample. 
School outcomes were limited to grades in language and mathematics 
which can be affected by a number of factors. Despite 
this however, results remained significant even after controlling 
for potential confounds. Cognitive performance was not evaluated 
using standardized tests, as it was not feasible for a large 
multicenter sample. Indeed, grades used as proxies for cognitive 
function should eventually be complemented by cognitive testing. 
Nevertheless, our results suggest that academic achievements are 
negatively affected by sleepiness and SDB.

Finally, a possible unmeasured confounding factor is the possibility 
that there could be more students with poor economic 
background and /or low cognitive capabilities (unrelated to sleep) 
among those students with unhealthy sleeping habits than in the 
groups with regular sleeping habits. IQ evaluations are difficult to 
run in large samples and socioeconomic data was not available, 
so we were unable to assess this possibility.

While students in other populations attempt to catch up on sleep 
debt during weekends, youngsters in our sample seemed to aggravate 
their sleep debt by further reducing sleep time on weekends. 
Thus, this population appears to be at a strikingly high risk for 
chronic sleep debt. Further studies should be carried out to identify 
the full impact of this in the Argentine population as well as other 
Latin American countries. This and other sleep problems need to be 
confronted through education and enhanced diagnosis of SDB as 
well as changing poor sleep habits among adolescents.

In summary, the Spanish PDSS showed similar internal consistency 
and relationship to academic performance as compared 
to the English original version. Children at high risk for SBD 
showed lower academic performance. Daytime sleepiness as measured 
by the PDSS was robustly and significantly associated with 
academic failure. Taking into account the ease of administration 
of this scale, the PDSS has a potential role as a clinical tool in the 
practitioner’s office to evaluate sleepiness and predict academic 
failure. Parents’ recall of snoring and apneas in their children can 
be easily collected during medical evaluation and used as an indicator 
of risk of disease and poor academic performance.

*Model includes PDSS or “snoring or apnea variables” as criterion 
variables and BMI z- score, age, gender, attending a specific school, 
and sleep hours during the week as predictors. OR = odds ratio. The 
significance of the PDSS score here indicates that for each point increase 
in sleepiness on the PDSS there was a 5% increase in the risk 
for academic failure in the respective course area.
