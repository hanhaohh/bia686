Objective: 
To study long-term changes in quality of life 
in children after adenotonsillectomy for obstructive sleep 
apnea (OSA) documented by polysomnography. 

Design 
and 
Setting: 
Prospective study of children with 
OSA at the University of New Mexico Children’s Hospital, 
Albuquerque. 

Methods: 
Children who met inclusion criteria underwent 
adenotonsillectomy. Caregivers were asked to complete 
the OSA-18 quality of life survey prior to surgery 
(survey 1), within 7 months after surgery (short-term) 
(survey 2), and between 9 and 24 months after surgery 
(long-term) (survey 3). Scores from the preoperative and 
postoperative surveys were compared using the paired 
t 
test. 

Results: 
The study population included 34 children, 27 
(79%) of whom were male. The mean age of the chil


dren at the time of inclusion in the study was 6.7 years 
(range, 3.0-16.8 years). The mean total score for survey 
1 (76.7) was significantly higher (P.001) than the mean 
total score for survey 2 (32.0) or for survey 3 (40.9). However, 
the domains of sleep disturbance and physical suffering 
were significantly lower (P.005) in survey 2 than 
in survey 3. The differences in the domains of emotional 
distress, daytime problems, and caregiver concerns 
between survey 2 and survey 3 were not statistically 
significant. 

Conclusions: 
Caregivers perceive a long-term improvement 
in quality of life after adenotonsillectomy for OSA 
although these improvements are more pronounced in 
the short-term than in the long-term and are not uniform 
across all domains of the OSA-18 survey.

VER THE LAST 20 YEARS1 
there has been growing 
awareness of the effects 
of sleep-disordered 
breathing on behavior,2 
school performance,3 and quality of life4,5 
in children. Sleep-disordered breathing 
comprises a spectrum of airway disorders6 
that ranges from simple snoring to 
obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Full-
night polysomnography is the “gold standard” 
for distinguishing OSA from milder 
forms of sleep-disordered breathing such 
as simple snoring.7 The estimated prevalence 
of OSA in 4-year-old children is 1% 
to 3%,8 but the overall prevalence of other 
forms of sleep-disordered breathing is 
much higher.9 

Quality of life instruments such as the 
OSA-18 survey10 have been used increasingly 
as measures of outcome after adenotonsillectomy 
for pediatric OSA. Previous 
studies4,5 have shown short-term improvements 
in the total score and in each domain 
of the OSA-18 after adenotonsillec


tomy. The present study examines long-
term improvements in quality of life after 
surgical therapy for OSA in children. 

METHODS
Approval for this study was obtained from the 
institutional review board of the University of 
New Mexico School of Medicine, Albuquerque. 
Children who were referred to the Pediatric 
Otolaryngology Service with a sleep 
disturbance and shown to have OSA by polysomnography 
were included in the study. Exclusion 
criteria included (1) children younger 
than 3 years or older than 18 years; (2) children 
who previously had an adenotonsillectomy 
or polysomnography; and (3) children 
with craniofacial syndromes, neuromuscular 
disease, developmental delay, or psychiatric disorders. 


The effectiveness of adenotonsillectomy 
for the relief of OSA was evaluated using the 
OSA-18 survey.10 The survey comprises 18 
items in 5 domains of sleep disturbance, physical 
suffering, emotional distress, daytime problems, 
and caregiver concerns. The domains of 
emotional distress and daytime problems con

tain 3 items, whereas the other domains contain 4 items. A point 
scale is used ranging from 1 (none of the time) to 7 (all of the 
time) to grade the relative severity of the problem addressed 
in each item. The total score, domain score, and item score were 
recorded. A power analysis indicated that a sample size of 30 
is adequate to detect a 20-point difference in OSA-18 total score 
with 80% power and =.05. Based on the original study by 
Franco et al,10 a change in OSA-18 total score from 60 to 80 
indicates a change from moderate to severe impact on health-
related quality of life. Therefore, the present study of 34 children 
has more than sufficient power to detect a clinically important 
change in health-related quality of life based on OSA-18 
total score. 

All study participants underwent full-night polysomnography7,11 
to document the respiratory distress index (RDI), the 
average number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep. A 
sleep medicine physician interpreted the results of polysomnography. 
An RDI of 5 or greater was considered a positive 
finding. 

Children with OSA underwent a monopolar Bovie adenotonsillectomy. 
Caregivers were asked to complete the OSA-18 
before surgery (survey 1), within 6 months after surgery (survey 
2), and between 9 and 24 months after surgery (survey 3). 
Subtracting the mean scores for survey 2 or survey 3 from survey 
1 derived the mean changes in score for short-term and long-
term intervals after surgery. In addition, the mean change in 
score between the 2 postoperative intervals was also calculated 
by subtracting the mean scores for survey 3 from survey 

2. The 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for both 
mean scores and difference scores. The standardized response 
mean (SRM), defined as the difference score divided by the standard 
deviation of the difference score, was used to estimate the 
extent of improvement after surgery. Scores from the preoperative 
and postoperative results of the OSA-18 survey were compared 
using SAS procedures (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) for 
the paired t 
test. 
RESULTS
The study population comprised 60 children. The caregivers 
for 26 of these children did not complete at least 
1 of the postoperative OSA-18 surveys. As a consequence, 
the study population included 34 children, 27 
(79%) of whom were male. The mean age of the children 
at the time of inclusion in the study was 6.7 years 
(range, 3.0-16.8 years). Seventeen children (50%) were 
Hispanic or Latino; 12 children (35%) were white (non-
Hispanic or non-Latino); and 3 children (9%) were Native 
American. Ethnicity was not identified in 2 children. 
The mean RDI was 33.4 (range, 6.5-110.5 [95% 

confidence interval, 24.2-42.7]). Seventeen children 
(50%) were morbidly obese as evidenced by an age-and 
gender-corrected body mass index in the 95th percentile 
or above. 

The mean intervals were 2.1 months (range, 0.6


6.8 months) between survey 1 and surgery; 4.2 months 
(range, 1.3-6.8 months) between surgery and survey 2; 
16.4 months (range, 6.9-29.2 months) between surgery 
and survey 3; and 12.4 months (range, 4.1-24.6 months) 
between survey 2 and survey 3. 
Mean total and domain scores for the OSA-18 
with 95% confidence intervals before and after adenotonsillectomy 
for OSA are presented in Table 
1. The 
mean total score for survey 1 (76.7) was significantly 
higher (P.001) than the mean total score for survey 
2 (32.0) or for survey 3 (40.9). However, the domains 
of sleep disturbance and physical suffering were significantly 
lower (P.005) in survey 2 than in survey 

3. The differences in the domains of emotional distress, 
daytime problems, and caregiver concerns 
between survey 2 and survey 3 were not statistically 
significant (Table 1). 
The mean difference scores and SRMs are given in 
Table 
2. The mean difference in total score for survey 
1 vs survey 2 was 44.7, and the difference score for each 
domain was positive (range, 4.2-12.8). The SRM for total 
score was 2.3, and the SRM for the domains ranged from 

0.8 to 2.4. The mean difference in total score for survey 
1 vs survey 3 was 35.8, and the difference score for each 
domain was positive (range, 3.9-10.6). The domain with 
the greatest mean difference score for the comparison between 
survey 1 vs survey 2 and survey 1 vs survey 3 was 
“sleep disturbance.” For survey 2 vs survey 3, the mean 
difference in total score was –8.9, and the difference score 
for each domain was negative (range –0.3 to –3.1). The 
SRM was –0.48 for total score and ranged from -0.04 to 
-0.58 among the domains. The domain with the greatest 
mean difference score for the comparison between survey 
2 vs survey 3 was “physical suffering.” 
The change in the OSA-18 survey domains after surgery 
is illustrated graphically in the Figure. There is a 
clear decrease in mean score for each domain for both 
survey 2 and survey 3. The mean scores for the domains 
of “sleep disturbance” and “physical suffering” are lower 
for survey 2 vs survey 3 (P.005), whereas the domains 
of “emotional distress,” “daytime problems,” and “caregiver 
concerns” are not significantly different (P.15).

COMMENT
The American Academy of Pediatrics9 has highlighted the 
need to delineate the natural history of OSA in children 
after adenotonsillectomy. The results of the present study 
demonstrate a long-term improvement in quality of life 
after adenotonsillectomy for pediatric OSA. The total score 
and all domains of the OSA-18 survey showed long-
term improvement after surgery as shown by a comparison 
of survey 1 with survey 3. Two previous studies4,5 
have reported short-term improvements in quality of life 
after surgery for OSA in children using the OSA-18 survey.
10 Goldstein et al4 studied 64 children before and 3 
months after adenotonsillectomy. The diagnosis of OSA 
was based on clinical parameters and did not include polysomnography 
in most children. A highly significant 
change was seen postoperatively (P.001) in the mean 
scores for all items and domains. Mitchell et al5 compared 
preoperative scores with postoperative scores obtained 
at a mean interval of 4 months after surgery in children 
with OSA diagnosed by full-night polysomnography. 
They also found statistically significant improvements in 
the total score and in every item and domain of the OSA-18 
survey. 

A comparison of the short-term results from survey 
2 obtained at a mean interval of 4 months with the 
long-term results from survey 3 obtained at a mean interval 
of 16 months after surgery (Figure) shows some 
important differences. The scores for the domains of sleep 
disturbance and physical suffering are lower in survey 2 
than in survey 3. These domains measure specific problems 
such as loud snoring, breath-holding spells, mouth 
breathing, and nasal discharge. It is likely that with time 
some of these symptoms recur but not to the extent that 
they were present prior to surgery. 

In contrast, the domains of emotional distress, daytime 
problems, and caregiver concerns are not significantly 
different in survey 2 and survey 3. These domains 
measure hyperactive behavior, attention and concentration 
spans, caregiver concerns about the child’s general 
health, and frustrations with the child. It is not clear why 
these domains do not show the changes seen in the domains 
of sleep disturbance and physical suffering. It may 
be that the recurrence of mild physical symptoms of sleep 
disturbance may not be sufficient to evoke changes in the 
child’s behavior. Equally, the parents may believe that surgical 
intervention has produced a substantive improvement 
in the child’s OSA and that occasional symptoms are 
normal and do not merit further concerns. 

There was no control group in the present study, 
since the standard of care for pediatric OSA is adeno

tonsillectomy. It is therefore not possible to infer that 
long-term improvement in quality of life was the result 
of surgical therapy. There may have been improvements 
in the underlying disorder as part of the natural history 
of the condition. Another limitation of the study is the 
relatively high number of children who were lost to follow-
up; 43% of the children who started the study 
failed to complete it, and the extent of their improvement 
in quality of life remains unknown. Finally, 
improvements in quality of life were not compared with 
physiological measurements as recorded by full-night 
polysomnography. Indeed, Mitchell et al5 showed that 
change in RDI is not correlated with change in OSA-18 
total score at a mean interval of 4 months after surgery. 
Therefore, we cannot conclude that long-term changes 
in quality of life are mirrored by changes in the physiological 
parameters of sleep. 

To our knowledge, this is the first reported study 
of long-term improvements in quality of life after adenotonsillectomy 
for OSA in children. However, these improvements 
are not uniform across all domains of the 
OSA-18 survey. Although caregivers note some recurrence 
of physical symptoms after adenotonsillectomy for 
OSA in children, they nevertheless perceive a long-term 
improvement in quality of life.
