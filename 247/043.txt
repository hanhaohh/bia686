Objective To document the sleep of overweight adolescents and to explore the degree 
to which weight-related sleep pathology might account for diminished psychosocial 
outcome. Methods Sixty children aged 10–16.9 from a weight-management clinic were 
compared to 22 healthy controls using comprehensive actigraphic, polysomnographic, and parent- 
and self-report questionnaire assessments. Results Overweight participants averaged more 
symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing, later sleep onset, shorter sleep time, and more 
disrupted sleep than controls. Although the groups did not differ in self-reported sleep habits, 
multiple concerns were reported by parents of overweight participants, including daytime 
sleepiness, parasomnias, and inadequate sleep. Group differences in academic grades and 
depressive symptoms were at least partially accounted for by short sleep and daytime 
sleepiness. Conclusions Excessive weight is associated with an increased risk of sleep 
problems. There is a need for further research in this area and for clinicians who work with 
overweight children to evaluate their sleep.

Deane, 2002). Interestingly, these psychosocial factors 
are correlates of overweight during early adolescence 
(Swallen, Reither, Haas, & Meier, 2005), with depressive 
symptoms more commonly reported than acting out 
behaviors among treatment-seeking adolescents (Zeller, 
Saelens, Roehrig, Kirk, & Daniels, 2004) and child 
mood being an important predictor of dropout from 
weight-management treatment (Zeller, Kirk et al., 
2004). However, little research has examined whether 
poor sleep quantity or quality mediates the links 
between childhood overweight and psychosocial outcome. 

The primary aim of this study was to provide 
detailed documentation of the sleep of overweight 
adolescents as compared with normal-weight controls 
of similar demographic background. It was hypothesized 
that the overweight group would display shorter 
sleep duration, poorer quality sleep, and greater evidence 
of sleep-disordered breathing than normal-
weight controls. The secondary aim was to explore 
the degree to which short sleep, daytime sleepiness, 
and OSA symptoms could account for the diminished 
academic performance and depressive symptoms 
that have been reported among adolescents who are 
overweight. 

Methods 

Sample and Procedures 

The overweight group was comprised of 60 participants, 
aged 10–16.9 years, who were recruited consecutively 
at the time of intake into a hospital-based 
multidisciplinary pediatric weight-management clinic. 
Exclusion criteria included neurological history (e.g., 
seizures), craniofacial abnormalities, developmental 
disorders (e.g., Down syndrome), conditions involving 
daytime hypoxia (e.g., poorly controlled asthma), use 
of psychiatric or neurological medication (given potential 
effects on sleep), and treatment for OSA in the past 
2 years. The control group was comprised of 22 children, 
who had been healthy controls in a previous 
study (Zeller, Ramey, & Allen, 2003), or their siblings. 
Initial recruitment from that study was from a representative 
cross-section of public and private school classrooms, 
using the “revised class play” paradigm (Noll 
et al., 1999). Parents of controls aged 10–16.9 were 
invited by mail and telephone to participate in this 
study. Controls met the same exclusion criteria as overweight 
participants and were reported by their parents 
to be of normal weight. 

All procedures were approved by the local Institutional 
Review Board. Parents provided written consent 

and participants provided oral assent to participate. 
Families of overweight adolescents were compensated 
$50 for participating, while those of controls were compensated 
$70. The difference in compensation was justified 
by the greater potential for direct benefit to the 
overweight adolescents; indeed, because of study findings 
and with family consent, several were referred for 
clinical follow-up of previously undiagnosed OSA. During 
the first part of the research, parents and participants 
completed demographic and sleep questionnaires, and 
participants underwent a week of objective sleep monitoring 
with actigraphy (described below). Part two 
included behavioral questionnaires and an inpatient 
overnight sleep study. 

Measures 

Anthropometric Data 

To obtain body mass index (BMI; kg/m2), height was 
measured with a wall-based stadiometer and weight with 
a calibrated hospital scale. A BMI z-score was then computed 
based on tables published in 2000 by the U.S. 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Pubertal 
status was obtained via a validated self-report questionnaire 
(Carskadon & Acebo, 1993). 

Sleep Measures 

A comprehensive sleep evaluation protocol capitalized 
on the strengths of several measurement techniques. 
Parent-and self-report questionnaires were used to 
assess each reporter’s perspective on the participant’s 
typical sleep, including unusual sleep behaviors that are 
not well-quantified by other methods (e.g., parasomnias). 
However, questionnaires are subject to reporter 
and recall biases, as well as imprecision with respect to 
nocturnal arousals and sleep onset and offset times. 
Complementing questionnaire data, typical sleep patterns 
also were measured by actigraphy, which uses 
movement patterns to provide an objective, unobtrusive 
measure of sleep phase, duration, and continuity over 
multiple nights in the home (Acebo et al., 1999; Sadeh, 
Sharkey, & Carskadon, 1994). Finally, overnight polysomnography 
(PSG) objectively measured sleep-stage 
distribution and sleep-related respiratory function. PSG 
was conducted during a single night in a hospital-based 
sleep laboratory with an examiner-determined bedtime 
and noninvasive but mildly obtrusive monitoring. As a 
result, although PSG is considered the gold standard for 
the diagnosis of OSA, actigraphy and questionnaires 
may yield better measures of a child’s typical sleep habits. 
By using these complementary measurement techniques, 
we sought to obtain a more complete and 
accurate picture of participants’ sleep. 


Sleep and Overweight Adolescents 

Parent-Report Sleep Questionnaire. The Child Sleep 
Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) (Owens, Spirito, & 
McGuinn, 2000) is a broad-band measure of pediatric 
sleep difficulties. For each of 45 items, parents rate 
whether a sleep-related behavior occurs rarely, sometimes, 
or often. The questionnaire has eight subscales: 
bedtime resistance, sleep onset delay, adequacy of sleep 
duration, sleep-related anxiety, night wakings, parasomnias 
(e.g., talks during sleep), sleep-disordered breathing 
(e.g., snores loudly), and daytime sleepiness. It also 
includes an item assessing napping frequency, as well as 
open-ended queries on bedtime, rise time, and sleep 
duration for weeknights and weekends. Parent-reported 
sleep duration was computed as the mean of the direct 
report of the parent and the arithmetic difference 
between reported bedtime and rise time. Parents also 
completed the sleepiness and sleep-disordered breathing 
subscales from the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ) 
(Chervin, Hedger, Dillon, & Pituch, 2000). All CSHQ 
and PSQ items and subscales were coded so that high 
scores reflect increased pathology. 
Self-Report Sleep Questionnaires. The Pediatric Daytime 
Sleepiness Scale (PDSS) (Drake et al., 2003) is a validated 
scale that asks about the frequency of difficulty 
waking in the morning and the ability to maintain 
arousal during the day. The Youth Sleep Habits Survey 
(YSHS) (Acebo & Carskadon, 2002; Wolfson et al., 
2003) is a validated survey measure from which we analyzed 
five subscales: sleepiness 1 (situations in which 
sleepiness occurs), sleepiness 2 (general frequency of 
feeling sleepy), sleep quality (satisfaction with sleep), 
sleep delay (e.g., staying up past 3:00 a.m.), and ‘owl 
and lark’ (time of day preferences for various activities). 
In addition, the YSHS includes open-ended items relating 
to bed and rise times and total sleep duration. Self-
reported sleep duration was computed as the mean of 
the direct report of the participants and the arithmetic 
difference between reported bedtime and rise time. 
Polysomnography (PSG). Each participant underwent 
inpatient full-night PSG, with a parent or guardian 
present in a separate bed. Participants were not deprived 
of sleep before the PSG and were not given any sedative. 
The following were monitored: Electroencephalogram 
(C3-A2, C4-A1, O1-A2, O2-A1), electrooculogram, submental 
and tibial electromyogram, electrocardiography, nasal/oral 
airflow through nasal pressure transducer or a three-
pronged thermistor, end-tidal CO2 (at the nose), snoring 
microphone, O2 saturation by pulse oximeter, oximeter 
pulse waveform, actigraphy to measure limb movements, 
infrared video monitoring, and rib cage and abdominal 
volume (respiratory inductance plethysmograph). Sleep 

staging and arousals were scored according to standardized 
criteria (American Sleep Disorders Association, 
1992; Rechtschaffen & Kales, 1968). Obstructive apneas 
(i.e., complete cessation of airflow) were defined as a 
>80% decline in airflow over two breaths, despite continued 
chest/abdominal wall movement. Obstructive 
hypopneas (i.e., partial cessation of airflow) were 
defined as a decrease of 50–80% in airflow over at least 
two breaths that was associated with (a) paradoxical respiration, 
and (b) oxyhemoglobin desaturation (=4%) or 
a subsequent arousal. The following variables were 
coded for analyses: sleep duration, sleep efficiency after 
sleep onset (percent of the total sleep period spent 
asleep), percent of sleep in each stage (1–4 and rapid eye 
movement or REM), lowest oxygen saturation, and percent 
of sleep spent hypercapnic (end-tidal CO2 > 50). 
The obstructive apnea index (AI), apnea + hypopnea 
index (AHI), and arousal index (ArI) were each computed 
as the sum of relevant events divided by hours 
slept. 
Actigraphy. The actigraphs used in the present study 
(Mini-Motionlogger, Ambulatory Monitoring, Inc., NY) 
are the size of a sports wristwatch and were worn on 
participants’ non-dominant wrists during evening and 
overnight hours. The devices carry a motion detector 
and internal memory that records movement counts in 
1-min epochs. These data were subsequently compared 
against a self-report sleep diary to screen for potential 
artifacts, such as removal of the watch. The following 
variables were then inferred from a validated algorithm 
(Sadeh et al., 1994): sleep onset and offset times, total 
sleep period duration (offset minus onset), sleep efficiency, 
number of awakenings from sleep, number of 
awakenings from sleep that lasted longer than 5 min, 
and the longest period of sleep. 

Three sets of actigraphy data were generated. The 
first was comprised of each participant’s average scores 
for all nights studied, provided at least five nights were 
recorded. This threshold has been established to ensure 
reliability (Acebo et al., 1999) but does not allow for the 
differentiation of school versus non-school-nights. As 
supplemental indexes, the second set of actigraphy data 
was comprised of each participant’s average for school-
nights, provided at least three such nights were 
recorded, and the third was comprised of each participant’s 
average for non-school-nights, provided at least 
two such nights were recorded. 

Academic Grades and Symptoms of Depression 

Participants and parents reported the participants’ typical 
academic grades on an 8-point scale (As, As & Bs, Bs, 


72 Beebe et al. 

Bs & Cs, Cs, Cs & Ds, Ds, Ds & Fs). The two reports 
were highly correlated, r = .81, p < .001, so they were 
averaged into a single index. Depressive symptoms were 
reported by parents via the depression subscale from the 
Behavioral Assessment System for Children (Reynolds 
& Kamphaus, 1992), a validated parent-report psychopathology 
questionnaire. After a mid-study protocol 
change, 16 overweight and 21 control participants also 
completed the Children’s Depression Inventory (Kovacs, 
1992), a validated pediatric self-report questionnaire of 
depressive symptoms. Because the correlation between 
parent- and self-report of depressive symptoms was 
modest (r = .45), these scores were analyzed separately. 

Preprocessing of Data and Analytic Strategy 

On questionnaires, missing data were typically due to 
omission of one or two items on a multi-item subscale. 
Consequently, when less than half of a subscale’s items 
were missing, composites were prorated from the remaining 
items. Several sleep indexes were log-transformed to 
reduce skew, which included the AI and AHI from the 
PSG, the PSQ and CSHQ sleep-disordered breathing sub-
scales, the PSQ sleepiness subscale, and the CSHQ sleep 
onset delay subscale. 

Demographic characteristics across groups were 
compared using chi-square, Fisher’s exact tests, or independent 
sample t-tests. These tests also compared cases 
where there were missing data for a given set of analyses 
to those with complete data on age, sex, race, family 
income, maternal education, and study group. 

Primary analyses were comprised of eight multivariate 
analyses of variance (MANOVA), clustered on conceptual 
and pragmatic grounds. The first compared the 
overweight group to controls on PSG variables. The second 
through fourth compared the groups on the three 
sets of actigraphy data. The fifth compared the groups 
on parent-reported bedtimes and arousal times, while 
the sixth compared the groups on the other parent-
reported sleep indexes. The seventh and eighth were 
similar but replaced parent-report questionnaires with 
self-report. 

To increase the clinical utility of these findings, we 
then compared the prevalence of sleep-disordered 
breathing (on PSG and per parent report), as well as 
daytime sleepiness, short sleep duration, and sleep disruption 
in participants’ natural settings (on questionnaires 
and actigraphy). Unfortunately, few established 
normative values exit in the pediatric sleep medicine literature. 
For present purposes, sleep-disordered breathing 
was defined alternatively as an AHI >1, AHI >5, or a 
PSQ sleep-disordered breathing score >0.5, indicating 
endorsement of at least half the items; daytime sleepiness 

was indexed by a PDSS =20 or a PSQ sleepiness score 
=0.5, both indicating reported sleepiness on at least half 
of the items; short sleep was defined as <8 h; and sleep 
disruption was defined as post-onset sleep efficiency 
<80%. Odds ratios were computed with and without 
adjustments for age, race, gender, income, and maternal 
education. 

To address the secondary aim, three sets of regression 
equations were computed, one with the composite 
academic grade scale as dependent variable and the others 
with parent- and self-report depressive symptoms as 
dependent. In each set, the variance accounted for by 
group membership was first computed as a zero-order 
association; then analyses were rerun with selected sleep 
variables as covariates. Potential covariates were selected 
based on prior research that suggests an association of 
childhood overweight with short sleep, sleepiness, and 
OSA: log-transformed AHI, parent-reported OSA symptoms, 
parent- and self-report of sleepiness and sleep 
duration on weeknights and weekends, and actigraphderived 
sleep duration on weeknights and weekends. To 
maximize statistical power, only those covariates that 
predicted each dependent measure in stepwise entry 
were retained in the final analyses. 

Alpha was set at .05 for statistical significance, with 
Holm’s procedure controlling Type I error in primary 
analyses (see below). Statistical “trends” (p < .10) are 
also reported so that readers can judge their potential 
relevance in light of the modest sample sizes. 

Results 

Sample Characteristics 

As summarized in Table I, the groups did not significantly 
differ in age, grade placement, sex, pubertal status, 
family income, maternal education, or race (all but 
three non-Caucasian participants—two overweight and 
one control—were African-American). By design, the 
groups differed in body mass. All controls fell in the 
24th–92nd percentiles of BMI for age and sex; all overweight 
participants were above the 95th percentile and 
65% were above the 99th percentile. 

All participants underwent PSG. Eighty-four percent 
of participants wore the actigraph at least five 
nights, 62% at least three school nights, and 78% at least 
two non-school nights. Parent questionnaires yielded all 
subscales 89% of the time and all bed and arousal times 
67% of the time. Ninety-two percent of self-report questionnaires 
yielded all subscales, while 100% reported 
sleep onset and offset times. More Caucasians than non-
Caucasians had school-night actigraphy data, p = .001,

income, and maternal education as covariates. 

Primary Analyses: Group Differences in Sleep 

The overweight and control groups differed on the multivariate 
PSG analysis, F(12, 66) = 2.51, p = .011. Follow-
up univariate analyses presented in Table II show that 

Table II. Polysomnographic Characteristics 

this was primarily due to a difference across groups in 
log-transformed AHI (log-AHI), with statistical trends 
on log-transformed AI and percent of sleep spent in 
stage 3. 

The groups differed in multivariate actigraphy findings 
for the entire recording period, F(8, 60) = 3.69, p = .001, 
and weekends, F(8, 52) = 3.96, p = .001, but not weeknights, 
F(8, 44) = 1.95, p = .105. Table III presents 
univariate data. The overweight group on average fell 
asleep later and had shorter and more disrupted sleep 
than controls. Although the findings were similar in 
pattern across school nights and non-school nights, the 
latter more clearly showed effects. 

The groups showed a multivariate difference on 
parent-report questionnaire subscales, F(12, 59) = 3.07,

groups. In contrast, there was not a multivariate difference 
between the overweight and control groups in self-
report subscales, F(8, 66) = 1.31, p = .25, or sleep onset 
and offset times, F(4, 77) = 0.88, p = .48. 

Given that eight MANOVAs were run, we used 
Holm’s sequential procedure to guard against Type 1 
errors. This procedure has improved power over the 
Bonferroni correction without sacrificing control of 
Type I error (Aickin & Gensler, 1996). Under this procedure, 
the most stringent Bonferroni alpha cut-off (.05/8 
or .006 in this case) is applied only to the most statistically 
significant finding in the family of analyses. If this 
threshold is crossed, then the next best significance level 
obtained in the family is compared to a slightly less 
stringent cut-off (.05/7 or .007 in this case), and so on. 
Using this procedure, the multivariate findings for PSG, 
actigraphy for the total recording period and for weekends, 
and parent-report questionnaire subscales all 
exceeded significance thresholds, whereas the others fell 
far short. 

Table V summarizes follow-up analyses on the 
prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing, short sleep, 
sleep disruption, and daytime sleepiness. These categorical 
findings mirror those from analyses in which 
sleep was treated continuously. Sleep problems were 
often several times more likely among overweight participants 
than controls. Indeed, some odds ratios could 

not be computed because no controls met cut-offs for 
pathology. 

Secondary Analyses: Does Sleep Mediate Group 
Effects on Grades and Depressive Symptoms? 

Study group accounted for 4.2% of the variance in academic 
grades, p = .033, 6.0% of the variance in parent-
report depressive symptoms, p = .013, and 24.8% of the 
variance in self-report depressive symptoms, p = .001. 
The overweight group averaged one letter grade poorer 
(B/C vs. A/B) and was one standard deviation higher on 
depressive symptoms (parent T = 53 vs. 45, self T = 55 
vs. 45) than controls. 

Several potential covariates correlated with academic 
grades in bivariate analyses: log-AHI, r = .34, p = 
.002; actigraph-determined sleep duration for all 
recorded nights and weeknights, r = –.23 and –.28, p = 
.045 and .043, respectively; log-PSQ sleepiness, r = .25, 
p = .023; parent-reported weeknight sleep, r = -.33, p = 
.003; and PDSS, r = .39, p < .001. In stepwise entry into 
the prediction of academic grades, only the PDSS and 
parent-reported and self-reported weeknight sleep 
were unique predictors, together accounting for 24% of 
the variance in grades, p = .003. Consequently, a 
regression equation was constructed in which academic 
grades were predicted by these three covariates, 
followed by study group. The amount of variance

In bivariate analyses, the CSHQ sleepiness subscale 
and the log-PSQ sleepiness subscale each correlated with 
parent-reported depressive symptoms, r = .33 and .27, 
p = .003 and .017, respectively, but only the former survived 
stepwise regression entry. A regression equation 
consequently predicted parent-reported depressive 
symptoms by CSHQ sleepiness, followed by study 
group. The variance uniquely predicted by study group 
was thereby cut to 2.2%, p = .17. 

Self-reported depressive symptoms correlated with 
log-PSQ sleepiness, r = .51, p = .001; parent report of 
weekend sleep, r = –.33, p = .050; PDSS, r = .54, p = .001; 
self-report on the YSHS Sleepiness 1 subscale, r = .34, 
p = .001; and self-report of weeknight sleep, r = –.40, 
p = .017. Only the PDSS and parent- and self-reports of 
weeknight sleep duration survived stepwise entry into 
the prediction of self-report depressive symptoms, 
together accounting for 57% of the variance, p <.001. A 
regression equation entering these three covariates, 
followed by study group, found that the variance in self-
reported depressive symptoms that was uniquely predicted 
by study group was cut to 7.1%, p = .022. 

Taken together, these data suggest that sleep duration 
on weeknights and daytime sleepiness may have 
mediated the difference between the groups in academic 
grades and may have at least partially mediated group 
differences in depressive symptoms. 

Discussion 

Consistent with our hypotheses, overweight adolescents 
were at elevated risk for sleep-disordered breathing. In 
addition, actigraphy data collected in the child’s normal 
sleep environment found that, compared to demographically 
similar normal-weight controls, those who were 
overweight averaged shorter sleep time—due largely to a 
later sleep onset—and less efficient and more disrupted 
sleep. Although the groups did not differ in self-reported 
sleep habits, multiple sleep concerns were reported by 
parents of overweight participants, including daytime 
sleepiness, parasomnias (e.g., sleepwalking), bedtime 
resistance, delayed sleep onset, and dissatisfaction with 
the adolescent’s sleep duration. 

Because of the cross-sectional research design, it is 
impossible from these data to infer the direction of causality 
between sleep problems and high body mass. 
However, the research literature suggests that short 
sleep duration may contribute to excessive weight gain 
(Agras et al., 2004; Reilly et al., 2005; Sugimori et al., 

2004). The mechanism for this is not known, but sleep 
deprivation may cause dietary cravings and hormonal 
and metabolic shifts that foster weight gain (Spiegel, 
Tasali, Penev, & van Cauter, 2004). Further, sleep deprivation 
hampers attention, impulse control, and higher 
level problem solving (Durmer & Dinges, 2005), providing 
a second route by which dietary choices might be 
undermined. Finally, sleepiness may contribute to physical 
inactivity, although activity level has not been found 
to statistically mediate the link between short sleep and 
overweight (von Kries et al., 2002; Sekine et al., 2002). 

On the other hand, OSA is more likely to be an 
effect, rather than a cause, of overweight. In adults, OSA 
is particularly predicted by fat deposition centrally and 
around the upper airway (Gami, Caples, & Somers, 
2003). Weight loss among overweight adolescents and 
adults often results in improvement of OSA (Dixon, 
Schachter, & O’Brien, 2005; Sugerman et al., 2003). 
Overweight children also are at elevated risk for residual 
or recurrent OSA following adenotonsillectomy, the 
most common treatment (Mitchell & Kelly, 2004; Morton 
et al., 2001). Interestingly, even when effective, adenotonsillectomy 
may be followed by weight gain, not 
loss, among lean and overweight children alike (Soultan, 
Wadowski, Rao, & Kravath, 1999). 

The excessive daytime sleepiness reported by parents 
of overweight participants may result from short 
sleep time, poor sleep quality, increased respiratory 
effort during sleep, or excessive weight itself. Each has 
been linked to systemic inflammation that may promote 
sleepiness (Mills & Dimsdale, 2004). Of note, our overweight 
adolescents appeared to be going to bed later 
than their lean counterparts despite reported sleepiness. 

Even if daytime sleepiness and short sleep are the 
consequence, rather than the cause, of overweight, they 
may mediate at least some of the link between pediatric 
overweight and psychosocial morbidity. In this study, 
short sleep and daytime sleepiness together statistically 
accounted for much of the difference between the 
groups in academic grades and self-reported depressive 
symptoms. Daytime sleepiness also accounted for much 
of the difference between groups in parent-reported 
depressive symptoms. It is important to note that these 
findings were based on exploratory analyses and should 
be considered preliminary. Moreover, the symptoms of 
sleepiness and those of depression can be difficult to disentangle, 
though it may be helpful to limit item overlap 
on questionnaires. For example, the BASC depression 
subscale focuses on mood and social functioning, rather 
than somatic symptoms, whereas items on the PDSS and 
the sleepiness subscales from the CSHQ and PSQ focus 


Sleep and Overweight Adolescents 77 

almost exclusively upon drowsiness or sleep need (not 
mood or social functioning). While the behavioral manifestations 
of tiredness and depressed mood share some 
features, the minimal item overlap in our measures 
lends some confidence that associations between parent-
reported sleepiness and depressive symptoms found in 
this sample were not simple artifacts. Further, exploratory 
analyses suggest that the several nonsomatic sub-
scales on the CDI correlated with diminished weeknight 
sleep in this sample (data not shown), lending further 
confidence to our conclusions. These preliminary findings 
highlight the need for further investigation of the 
potential role of sleep-related variables as mediators of 
adverse psychosocial outcomes among overweight 
children. 

Current data also suggest that research on the sleep 
of overweight children extend beyond OSA, sleep duration, 
and daytime sleepiness. In this sample, overweight 
was associated with parasomnias and diminished sleep 
quality, neither of which has received much research 
attention in this population. Sleep-disordered breathing 
may contribute to increased restlessness and to partial 
arousal parasomnias (Guilleminault, Palombini, Pelayo, 
& Chervin, 2003). While actigraphy can neither differentiate 
partial from complete arousals nor determine the 
nature of sleep disruption, our findings do suggest the 
presence of disruptions in sleep continuity. 

Despite evidence of differences in sleep functioning 
across groups based on parent-report and two objective 
sleep measures, self-report measures failed to yield significant 
differences. To some degree, this may relate to 
the relative inaccessibility of key sleep symptoms to self-
observation. For example, symptoms of OSA and parasomnias 
are almost always more apparent to others than 
to the person who experiences them. It is also worth 
noting that self-report effects were generally in the same 
direction as those found via parent-report and actigraphy, 
but analyses may have been underpowered. 

These findings have important clinical implications. 
Clinicians working with overweight adolescents should 
ask about symptoms associated with OSA, including 
loud snoring, labored breathing, or breathing pauses 
during sleep. When there is a suspicion of OSA, patients 
should be referred for formal sleep evaluation. The 
American Academy of Sleep Medicine and American 
Board of Sleep Medicine (http://www.sleepcenters.org, 
http://www.absm.org) list accredited sleep centers and 
board-certified sleep specialists. Clinicians should also 
ask about sleep habits. Current recommendations are 
that most adolescents need about 9¼ hours of sleep each 
night for optimal functioning (Mindell & Owens, 2003). 

Based on actigraphy, our control group came close to 
that only for non-school nights. Worse still, our overweight 
children averaged over an hour below recommendations 
on non-school nights and nearly 2 h below 
on school nights, suggesting the presence of a chronic 
sleep deficit that may have physiological and psychosocial 
consequences. Because this sleep deficit was largely 
due to delayed sleep onset, clinicians should attend to 
potential obstacles to establishing an appropriate bedtime. 
Current research cannot yet support the assertion 
that better sleep will contribute to weight loss, but successful 
interventions for sleep problems have been associated 
with subsequent gains in academic, behavioral, 
and emotional functioning (Gozal, 1998; Minde, Faucon, 
& Falkner, 1994). 

Before concluding, it is important to highlight key 
limitations of this study. Although the overweight participants 
were not referred because of sleep problems, 
the fact that they were participating in a comprehensive 
pediatric weight-management program may make them 
unique relative to the larger population of overweight 
individuals. Missing data may also affect how representative 
findings are of the general population. Present 
findings generally agree with those from epidemiological 
studies that had more limited sleep assessments, but 
some caution is recommended in applying the present 
findings to the general population, especially to minorities 
and low income families who disproportionately had 
missing data in this study, or to younger children. In 
addition, though the CSHQ has been validated with 
grade-school children, subscale findings in the current 
sample should be considered tentative; to our knowledge, 
no broad-band parent-report sleep questionnaire 
has published validity evidence for adolescents. On a 
similar measurement issue, although parent- and child-
reported grades correlated strongly, we did not have 
access to actual school records. Finally, the modest size 
of the sample (especially for self-reported depression) 
precluded investigation of more complex mediation and 
moderation models, such as developmental and gender 
effects, and whether sleep disorders can account for a 
wider array of weight-linked medical (e.g., insulin resistance) 
and behavioral morbidity. 

Even so, this study provides the most comprehensive 
assessment of sleep to date in a sample of overweight 
adolescents, drawing upon the strengths of both 
objective and subjective sleep assessment methods. 
Present data add to a growing body of literature that 
links short sleep to overweight, confirm previous findings 
of increased risk for OSA among overweight children, 
and further suggest the presence of a wider range 


78 Beebe et al. 

of sleep pathology, including parasomnias and poor 
sleep quality, among overweight adolescents. These data 
also suggest that at least some of the negative psychosocial 
factors known to be associated with excessive 
weight are also associated with sleep disturbance, with 
sleep acting as a potential mediator. By carefully considering 
children’s sleep, pediatric psychologists are in a 
unique position to develop novel approaches to the prevention 
of childhood overweight, behavioral weight-
management treatment, and prevention of weight-related 
morbidity.
