Summary 

Children with enlarged tonsils and adenoids usually 
present breathing abnormalities such as snoring, mouth 
breathing and sleep apnea. It is known that upper airway 
obstruction and consequent mouth breathing may result in 
pulmonary diseases. Aim: The goal of this preliminary study 
was to evaluate the inspiratory pressure in children with 
upper airway obstruction due to enlarged tonsils. Study 
design: clinical with transversal cohort. Material and 
Method: We evaluated 37 children (4 -13 years old, female/ 
male) with enlarged tonsils who would be submitted to a 
T&A surgery in the Department of Otolaryngology, Medical 
School, University of Sao Paulo, from October 2002 to March 
2003. The control group comprised 28 children without 
tonsillar disease submitted to the same tests. Inspiratory 
pressure was obtained using a manometer and vacuum 
meter. Results: We could observe lower inspiratory pressures 
in children with upper airway obstruction. The mean of 
inspiratory pressure in the upper airway obstruction group 
was 14.607cm/H2O and in the control group was of 
27.580cm/H2O. Conclusions: Enlarged tonsils and adenoids 
were associated with poor inspiratory pressure, resulting in 
increased breathing effort and work of the involved muscles.

INTRODUCTION 

Upper airway obstruction due to enlarged tonsils 
results in limited airflow. Such limitation is caused by a 
mechanical blockage that obstructs airflow, leading to 
mouth breathing, as it has lower resistance to air 
passage.1 

Under normal conditions, nasal resistance is greater 
in childhood – nearly six times higher than that observed in 
adults. According to Barreto2, nasal airway accounts for 2/3 
of total respiratory resistance. 

Pulmonary repercussion due to tonsil enlargement 
is better understood if considered in the context of 
“united airways”. In fact, disorders of upper and lower 
airways frequently coexist, as they present similar 
histology 3,4. 

Several clinical complaints have been associated with 
upper airways obstruction, such as excessive day sleepiness, 
desynchronized sleep, day headaches, aggressiveness, 
restless sleep, deep sudoresis, night enuresis, weight-height 
deficit15. Some authors relate obstruction of upper airways 
to bruxism.6 

Cazerta and Pacheco7 described two children with cor 
pulmonale, pulmonary edema and respiratory difficulty due 
to obstruction of airways by enlarged tonsils. After surgery, 
disorders regressed in one child, while the other child evolved 
to death due to important and irreversible hypertrophy of 
the right ventricle. Andrade& Britto reported five children 
with cardiac disorders due to enlarged tonsils, who presented 
regression of disorders in all cases8. 

Studies designed to objectively assess pulmonary 
repercussion of enlarged tonsils have not been developed. 
Several evaluation methods have been proposed to quantify 
the strength of respiratory muscles9. 

Inspiratory Pressure (IP), measured by a manometer 
and vacuum meter, is the most common and easy parameter. 
The manometer plus vacuum meter is used to quantify 
positive pressures (manometer) and negative pressures 
(vacuum meter). 

Measurement of respiratory muscles strength may be 
widely employed, allowing diagnosis of respiratory 
insufficiency due to muscular failure, early diagnosis of 
respiratory muscle weakness, helping the evaluation of 
respiratory mechanics and indication of intubation, removal 
of artificial breather and patients’ extubation. 

Due to the importance of efficient breathing in 
children with enlarged tonsils and the lack of objective data 
on this disorder’s repercussions, the present study aims at 
assessing IP in children with enlarged tonsils. 

MATERIAL AND METHOD 

Thirty-seven children (age range of 4-13 years, 
female/male) with obstruction of upper airways by 

enlarged tonsils were evaluated and followed up in the 
Department of Otolaryngology, Medical School, 
University of Sao Paulo, from October 2002 to March 
2003. 

Two children were excluded – one female and 
one male – for not performing in the procedure, and 7 
children for presenting grade 2 enlarged tonsils. Ten 
children were excluded, as they were under 6 years of 
age, since kids in this age were not evaluated in the 
control group. 

Children evaluated in the control group came from 
Casa de Apoio Madre Clélia, were within the same age range 
of the studied group and did not present tonsil 
enlargement or other respiratory disorders. IP tests were 
performed similarly and following the same criteria as those 
used in the enlarged tonsils group. 

In the control group, 28 children were evaluated (11 
females and 17 males) in the 4-13 age range. Three (3) 
children were excluded – 2 did not understand what was 
being asked and 1 presented tonsillitis at evaluation. 
Diagnosis of enlarged tonsil was obtained through paranasal 
sinuses radiography. Severity of palatine tonsillar obstruction 
was classified according to criterion described by Brodsky10 
(Table 1), including patients with grades III and IV 
obstruction. 

All the assessed children were in the group with 
surgery indication (adenotonsillectomy). Patients excluded 
from the group were those with asthma, neurological 
involvement, no surgery indication or those who did not 
understand what was being asked or did not help during 
complementary exams. 

Inspiratory pressure (IP) is defined as a maximum 
negative pressure produced orally against occluded 
airway11, as well as the maximum negative pressure 
through the mouth after complete expiration of residual 
volume, followed by a single inspiration of maximum 
effort12 or diaphragm force index13. This measure was 
obtained by a MV-120 manometer plus vacuum meter 
(Ger-Ar-SP Com. Equip. Ltda.) by means of a tracheal 
and mouth connector. For final results, all children had 3 
attempts and the highest value was considered (cm/

H2O). IP value was obtained with the children 
comfortably seated, with no restrictions to pulmonary 
expansion, such as tight clothes and orthodontic braces, 
among others. 

The protocol was submitted and approved by the 
Ethics and Research Committee of the Otorhinolaryngology 
Department, Hospital das Clinicas. Parents’ permission term 
was signed before evaluation. 

RESULTS 

The IP value obtained was significantly different 
between the groups: 14.607cm /H2O ± 7.3321 (8-24 cm/ 
H2O) in the enlarged tonsils group and 27.580/H2O ± 
4.7791(15- 40.00 cm/H2O) in the control group (n= 0.001) 
(Graph 1). Standard error was of 1.4664 in the enlarged 
tonsils group and of 0.8880 in the control group. Groups’ 
assessment according to age ranges presented the following: 
PI = 13.777cm/H2O ± 5.2387 (8-24cm/H2O) in the enlarged 
tonsils group (n=8) and 23.0 cm/H2O ± 8.4007 (15-36cm 
H2O) in the control group (n =7) among children between 
6 and 7 years of age, with statistically significant difference 
(p= 0.003) (Graph 2). Inspiratory pressure analyzed in the 
8-9 age range presented an IP of 18.00cm/H2O ± 4.106 
(10 – 24.00 cm/H2O) in the enlarged tonsils group (n=8) 
and IP of 29.54cm/H2O ± 5.043 in the control group (n=13) 
(p= 0.001) (Graph 3). The enlarged tonsils group in the age 
range of 10-13 years presented IP of 16.67cm/H2O ± 3.055 
(14 – 20.00cm /h2O) (n=3). Statistical difference was not 
significant between both groups (p= 0.293) (Graph 4). 

DISCUSSION 

Tonsils enlargement is one of the main causes of 
respiratory disorders during sleep. Oral breathing and snoring 
are very common symptoms in children14. 

There are no reports describing the use of IP for 
evaluation of respiratory muscle strength in children with 
enlarged tonsils. Therefore, we searched for groups of study 
on different pathologies in which IP measurement was 
applied in other diseases as a parameter of secondary 
pulmonary involvement. 

Iandelli assessed patients with neuromuscular diseases 
and verified several factors that may influence the IP value, 
such as: different techniques, personal motivation, 
cooperation and facial muscular weakness. However, despite 
these variations, this parameter may be applied in the 
evolution process of disease, as well as in the response to 
therapy.15 

In myasthenia gravis, the evaluation of 23 patients 
demonstrated that respiratory muscle strength remained 
normal, with no restrictive standard; however, the strength 
of respiratory muscles was reduced.16 In patients with 
multiple sclerosis, inspiration pressure is jeopardized by fa


tigue, muscular spasticity, and lack of coordination of 
respiratory and facial musculature12. In normal subjects, where 
the efficacy of postoperative incentive inspirometer was 
assessed, IP value was a good way to measure gain of the 
respiratory activity and, consequently, respiratory muscle 
strength17. 

In the present study, children with enlarged tonsils 
presented lower IP than those of the control group, which 
suggests reduced respiratory activity and, consequently, 
lower oxygenation, resulting in chronic hypoxia, as reported 
by Cazerta.7 

Children with enlarged tonsils presented difficulty to

mechanically breathe through the upper airways and, to 
survive, they chose a less resistant air passage, that is, the 
mouth. However, with time, they make less effort to breathe, 
demanding less force from respiratory muscles, which leads 
to muscle weakness. This mechanism explains the different 
pressures among the groups. 

The IP difference is more evident in younger age 
ranges. It is known that 90% of the craniofacial growth occurs 
up to 12 years old5. Therefore, at this age, when tonsil 
enlargement occurs, adjustment of bone structures regarding 
palatine and/or pharyngeal tonsils have already occurred. 
Children with enlarged tonsils present lower inspiratory 
pressure, which in our study was more evident among those

at ages of 6 and 7 years. 

The children included in our study, as well as the 
patients evaluated by Diez in a study conducted at Hospital 
La Paz – Madrid, in which 23 patients with clinically stable 
Myasthenia Gravis were assessed16 , did not present 
respiratory fatigue, despite the weak musculature. In both 
groups, IP and EP values were analyzed. 

We concluded that children with enlarged pharyngeal 
and palatine tonsils presented lower inspiratory pressure. 
These children must be treated, once tonsillar enlargement, 
in the long term, leads to facial tonus alterations, 
morphological craniofacial and occlusive alterations, with 
reduction of respiratory muscle strength. Moreover, the 
quality of life of these children is jeopardized.
