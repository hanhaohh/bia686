OBSTRUCTIVE 
SLEEP 
APNEA 
syndrome 
(OSAS) 
is 
a 
common 
disorder 
in 
the 
pedi


atric 
population. 
It 
is 
characterized 
by 
prolonged 
periods 
of 
increased 
upper 
airway 
resistance 
and 
partial 
or 
complete 
intermittent 
obstruction 
of 
the 
upper 
airway 
during 
sleep, 
which 
may 
be 
accompanied 
by 
episodic 
snoring, 
episodic 
oxyhemoglobin 
desaturations 
and 
hypercapnia, 
and 
repeated 
arousals. 
The 
prevalence 
of 
childhood 
OSA 
has 
been 
estimated 
at 
2% 
to 
3% 
of 
all 
children,1–8 
usually 
peaking 
in 
children 
between 
2 
and 
8 
years 
of 
age, 
and 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy 
is 
by 
far 
the 
major 
contributor 
to 
the 
pathophysiology 
of 
OSAS 
in 
children. 
OSAS 
in 
children 
not 
only 
is 
associated 
with 
increased 
health 
care 
costs9 
but 
also 
can 
result 
in 
a 
large 
array 
of 
morbidities, 
such 
as 
neurocognitive 
and 
behavioral 
disturbances,10–12 
enuresis,13,14 
systemic 
and 
pulmonary 
hypertension 
and 
endothelial 
dysfunction,15–18 
and 
somatic 
growth 
failure.19 


Although 
a 
combination 
of 
structural 
and 
neuromuscular 
abnormalities 
contributes 
to 
the 
occurrence 
of 
OSAS 
in 
children,20 
the 
severity 
of 
OSAS 
is 
primarily 
related 
to 
the 
adenoid 
and 
tonsillar 
size,21,22 
such 
that 
surgical 
extirpation 
of 
these 
tissues 
is 
usually 
the 
first 
line 
of 
treatment.23 
It 
is 
the 
standard 
of 
practice 
at 
our 
institution 
that 
children 
whose 
apnea/hypopnea 
index 
(AHI) 
in 
the 
overnight 
sleep 
study 
exceeds 
5 
events 
per 
hour 
of 
sleep 
should 
undergo 
adenotonsillectomy 
(T&A). 
This 
cutoff 
for 
T&A 
has 
been 
empirically 
established 
as 
a 
relative 
compromise 
between 
the 
need 
to 
prevent 
OSAS-related 
morbidity 
and 
the 
morbidity 
and 
mortality 
rates 
associated 
with 
T&A 
surgery;

however, 
different 
criteria 
for 
surgical 
referral 
are 
implemented 
among 
the 
various 
sleep 
laboratory 
centers 
in 
the 
United 
States 
and 
around 
the 
world 
and 
usually 
range 
between 
an 
AHI 
of 
2 
and 
5 
per 
hour 
of 
total 
seep 
time 
(TST). 
As 
such, 
there 
is 
still 
considerable 
debate 
as 
to 
whether 
therapy 
is 
indicated 
for 
children 
with 
milder 
OSAS 
and, 
if 
so, 
which 
approaches 
should 
be 
considered. 


It 
has 
now 
become 
apparent 
that 
nasal 
and 
oropharyngeal 
mucosal 
inflammation 
is 
present 
in 
patients 
with 
OSAS 
and 
may 
serve 
as 
an 
important 
determinant 
in 
the 
pathogenesis 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
in 
children.24 
In 
addition, 
whereas 
systemic 
corticosteroids 
are 
not 
useful 
in 
the 
management 
of 
pediatric 
OSAS,25 
globally 
favorable 
outcomes 
have 
been 
reported 
in 
the 
past 
decade 
by 
several 
groups 
of 
investigators 
who 
used 
intranasal 
corticosteroids 
in 
more 
severe 
pediatric 
OSAS 
in 
an 
attempt 
to 
reduce 
the 
size 
of 
the 
upper 
airway 
lymphoid 
tissues.26–30 
In 
their 
vast 
majority, 
however, 
these 
studies 
either 
did 
not 
use 
randomization 
approaches 
or 
did 
not 
assess 
milder 
OSAS 
cases 
that 
would 
have 
not 
been 
offered 
a 
surgical 
treatment 
option 
in 
most 
pediatric 
sleep 
centers. 


We 
recently 
showed 
that 
the 
lymphadenoid 
tissues 
of 
the 
upper 
airway 
of 
children 
with 
OSAS 
express 
glucocorticoid 
receptor 
. 
in 
high 
abundance 
and 
are 
therefore 
likely 
to 
respond 
favorably 
to 
therapy 
with 
topical 
steroids.31 
Therefore, 
we 
hypothesized 
that 
administration 
of 
intranasal 
budesonide 
for 
6 
weeks 
using 
a 
randomized, 
double-blind, 
crossover 
design 
would 
improve 
sleep-related 
disturbances 
in 
children 
with 
mild 
OSAS 
and 
that 
this 
effect 
would 
be 
sustained 
for 
at 
least 
6 
to 
8 
weeks 
after 
discontinuation 
of 
this 
therapy. 


METHODS 


The 
study 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
University 
of 
Louisville 
Human 
Research 
Committee, 
and 
informed 
consent 
was 
obtained 
from 
the 
legal 
caregiver 
of 
each 
child. 
Children 
were 
recruited 
from 
all 
pediatric 
patients 
who 
were 
referred 
for 
evaluation 
of 
snoring 
and 
who 
underwent 
clinical 
evaluation,

at 
the 
Kosair 
Children’s

Eligible 
for 
inclusion 
in 
the

were 
children 
who 
were 
older 
than 
6 
years

asthma 
that 
required 
chronic 
preventive 
therapy; 
hypersensitivity

with 
drugs 
that 
interact 
with 
budesonide 
(erythromycin, 
clarythromycin, 
ketoconazole, 
and 
cimetidine); 
known

in 
the 
2 
weeks 
before 
the 
initiation 
of 
the 
study; 
and 
children 
who 
already 
had 
had 
T&A 
in 
the 
past 
12 
months. 
In 
addition, 
children 
who 
were 
receiving 
long-term 
oral 
antihistamine 
preparations 
or 
nonsteroidal 
nasal 
decongestants 
were 
required 
to 
continue 
using 
these 
medications 
throughout 
the 
duration 
of 
the 
study. 
Patients 
who 
were 
receiving 
immunotherapy 
also 
continued 
on 
the 
same 
regimen 
without 
escalation 
of 
dosage 
and 
frequency 
throughout 
the 
duration 
of 
the 
study. 


Study 
Design 


During 
the 
period 
spanning 
from 
April 
2004 
until 
May 
2006, 
children 
who 
fulfilled 
the 
study 
inclusion 
criteria 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
PSG-1 
findings 
were 
recruited 
by 
1 
of 
the 
authors 
and 
assigned 
by 
a 
clinical 
research 
coordinator 
to 
1 
of 
2 
treatment 
groups 
using 
a 
double-blind, 
randomization, 
crossover 
procedure 
generated 
using 
random 
computer 
numeral 
allocation 
and 
managed 
by 
the 
same 
clinical 
research 
coordinator 
who 
was 
otherwise 
not 
involved 
in 
any 
aspect 
of 
the 
study 
(Fig 
1). 
The 
treatment 
group 
was 
started 
on 
a-6 
week 
course 
of 
intranasal 
topical 
budesonide 
(32 
g 
per 
puff 
per

to 
both 
nostrils 
[total 
dosage 
of 
64 
g]; 
the 
control 
group 
received 
once-a-day 
placebo 
spray 
[saline]). 
Parents 
were 
instructed 
to 
give 
the 
treatment 
at 
bedtime. 
After 
6 
weeks 
of 
either 
treatment, 
children 
underwent 
a 
second 
overnight 
sleep 
study 
(PSG-2) 
and 
a 
lateral 
neck 
radiograph 
(radiograph 
2). 
After 
a 
2-week 
washout 
period, 
children 
then 
started 
a 
6-week 
course 
with 
the 
compound 
that 
they 
were 
not 
receiving 
during 
the 
first 
phase 
of 
the 
study. 
All 
of 
the 
outcome 
end 
points 
were 
assessed 
again 
on 
completion 
of 
the 
second 
6-week 
course 
(PSG-3 
and

with 
an 
ambient 
temperature 
of

in 
the 
company 
of 
1 
of 
their 
parents. 
No 
drugs 
were 
used 
to 
induce 
sleep. 
The 
following 
parameters 
were 
measured: 
chest 
and 
abdominal 
wall 
movement 
by 
inductance 
plethysmography, 
heart 
rate 
by 
electrocardiography, 
air 
flow 
was 
triply 
monitored 
with 
a 
side-stream 
end-tidal 
capnograph 
that 
also 
provided 
breath-by-breath 
assessment 
of 
end-tidal 
carbon

levels 
(BCI 
SC-300, 
Menomonee

time-synchronized 
video 
recording 
was 
performed. 
The 
sleep 
technician 
followed 
patient 
behavior 
and 
confirmed 
sleep 
position 
by 
the 
infrared 
camera 
inside 
the 
room. 
All 
of 
the 
studies 
were 
initially 
scored 
by 
a 
certified 
technician 
and 
were 
then 
blindly 
reviewed 
by 
2 
physicians 
who 
were 
experienced 
in 
pediatric 
polysomnography 
and 
underwent 
training 
in 
an 
accredited 
fellowship 
program. 


Sleep 
architecture 
was 
assessed 
by 
standard 
techniques.
32 
The 
proportion 
of 
time 
spent 
in 
each 
sleep 
stage 
was 
expressed 
as 
percentage 
of 
TST. 
Central, 
obstructive, 
and 
mixed 
apneic 
events 
were 
counted. 
Obstructive 
apnea 
was 
defined 
as 
the 
absence 
of 
airflow 
with 
continued 
chest 
wall 
and 
abdominal 
movement 
for 
duration 
of 
at 
least 
2 
breaths.33,34 
Hypopneas 
were 
defined 
as 
a 
decrease 
in 
oronasal 
flow 
of 
50% 
with 
a 
corresponding 
decrease 
in 
SpO2 
of 
4% 
and/or 
arousal.34 
The 
obstructive 
AHI 
(OAHI) 
was 
defined 
as 
the 
number 
of 
apneas 
and 
hypopneas 
per 
hour 
of 
TST. 
Arousals 
were 
defined 
as 
recommended 
by 
the 
American 
Sleep 
Disorders 
Association 
Task 
Force 
report35 
and 
included 
respiratory-
related 
(occurring 
immediately 
after 
an 
apnea, 
hypopnea, 
or 
snore), 
technician-induced, 
and 
spontaneous 
arousals. 
Arousals 
were 
expressed 
as 
the 
total 
number 
of 
arousals 
per 
hour 
of 
sleep 
time. 


The 
diagnostic 
criteria 
for 
OSAS 
included 
an 
obstructive 
apnea 
index 
1 
per 
hour 
of 
TST, 
and 
an 
obstructive 
AHI 
of 
2 
per 
hour 
of 
TST 
with 
a 
nadir 
oxygen 
saturation 
value 
of 
at 
least 
92%.34 
The 
specific 
criteria 
for 
mild 
OSAS 
consisted 
of 
an 
AHI 
of 
2 
per 
hour 
of 
TST 
but 
7 
per 
hour 
of 
TST 
or 
an 
AHI 
of 
2 
per 
hour 
of 
TST 
but 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
a 
respiratory 
arousal 
index 
(RAI) 
of 
2 
per 
hour 
of 
TST 
and 
nadir 
oxygen 
saturation 
85%. 
Patients 
with 
a 
history 
of 
allergic 
rhinitis 
were 
also 
included 
when 
they 
met 
the 
PSG 
inclusion 
criteria. 


Lateral 
Film 
of 
the 
Neck 


For 
assessment 
of 
airway 
patency, 
lateral 
neck 
radiographs 
were 
performed 
using 
standard 
techniques 
in 
the 


radiology 
department 
at 
Kosair 
Children’s 
Hospital. 
The 
neck 
was 
extended, 
and 
the 
patient 
was 
instructed 
to 
breathe 
through 
the 
nose. 
The 
adenoidal/nasopharyngeal 
ratio 
was 
then 
measured 
according 
to 
the 
method 
of 
Fujioka 
et 
al36 
by 
1 
of 
the 
investigators 
(Dr 
Gozal), 
who 
was 
blinded 
to 
the 
treatment 
group 
and 
PSG 
findings 
of 
the 
children. 


Sample 
Size 
Estimate 


A 
minimal 
sample 
size 
of 
30 
patients 
per 
arm 
in 
this 
parallel 
design 
study 
was 
estimated 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
an 
. 
error 
of 
.05, 
. 
error 
of 
.2, 
an 
initial 
mean 
AHI 
of 
3 
per 
hour 
of 
TST, 
an 
SD 
of 
1.0 
per 
hour 
of 
TST, 
and 
a 
potential 
decrease 
in 
AHI 
by 
20%, 
while 
allowing 
for 
a 
20% 
attrition 
rate. 
In 
addition, 
such 
number 
of 
children 
would 
allow 
for 
detection 
of 
a 
30% 
improvement 
in 
adenoid 
size 
estimate. 
This 
design 
and 
target 
sample 
size 
also 
permitted 
determination 
of 
rebound 
exacerbation, 
when 
30% 
of 
posttherapy 
baseline, 
after 
transition 
from 
budesonide 
to

Data 
Analysis 


Results 
are 
presented 
as 
means 
. 
SEM, 
unless 
stated 
otherwise. 
We 
defined 
AHI 
and 
RAI 
as 
primary 
outcomes 
and 
adenoid 
size 
estimate 
as 
secondary 
outcome. 
All 
numeric 
data 
were 
subjected 
to 
statistical 
analyses 
using 
either 
t 
tests 
or 
2-way 
analysis 
of 
variance 
procedures 
for 
repeated 
measures 
followed 
by 
Neuman-Keuls 
posthoc 
tests, 
as 
appropriate. 
A 
2-tailed 
P 
. 
.05 
was 
considered 
statistically 
significant. 


RESULTS 


A 
total 
of 
62 
children 
were 
recruited 
of 
71 
potential 
consecutively 
identified 
eligible 
candidates 
after 
screening 
a 
total 
of 
97 
children, 
35 
of 
whom 
were 
found 
ineligible 
for 
the 
study 
(Fig 
1). 
The 
reasons 
for 
ineligibility 
were 
an 
AHI 
of 
7 
per 
hour 
of 
TST 
(n 
. 
29), 
receiving 
inhaled 
corticosteroids 
for 
asthma 
and 
allergic 
rhinitis 
(n 
. 
4), 
and 
T&A 
in 
the 
preceding 
year 
(n 
. 
2). 
Similarly, 
the 
reasons 
for 
nonparticipation 
among 
the 
71 
eligible 
children 
were 
lack 
of 
interest 
by 
the 
child 
or 
the 
family 
(5 
children) 
and 
unwillingness 
to 
use 
topical 
steroids 
by 
the 
parents 
(4 
children). 
These 
9 
children 
did 
not 
differ 
in 
any 
aspect 
from 
those 
who 
elected 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
study. 
Of 
the 
62 
participants, 
43 
completed 
all 
phases 
of 
the 
protocol, 
and 
19 
children 
completed 
the 
first 
arm 
of 
the 
protocol 
and 
subsequently 
decided 
to 
withdraw. 
Among 
the 
latter, 
14 
children 
were 
in 
the 
placebo 
treatment 
group 
and 
5 
were 
in 
the 
budesonide 
treatment 
group. 
Thus, 
the 
relative 
risk 
for 
withdrawal 
from 
the 
study 
was 
2.80 
for 
children 
who 
started 
on 
placebo 
compared 
with 
those 
who 
started 
with 
intranasal 
budesonide 
(95% 
confidence 
interval: 
1.15–6.83; 
P 
. 
.02 
after 
Mantel-Haenszel 
correction). 
The 
reason 
for 
withdrawal 
included 
unwillingness 
of 
the 
child 
to 
continue 
with 
the 
nasal 
spray 
(7 
children), 
marked 
improvement 
and 
satisfaction 
with 
the 
outcome 
of 
the 
first 
arm 
of 
the 
study 
(6 
children 
with 
5 
being 
among 
those 
receiving 
intranasal 
budesonide),

Table 
1 
shows 
the 
similar 
demographic 
and 
initial 
PSG 
characteristics 
of 
the 
43 
children 
who 
completed 
all 
phases 
of 
the 
study 
and 
of 
the 
19 
children 
who 
completed 
only 
phase 
1 
of 
the 
experimental 
protocol. 
Ther


for 
allergic 
symptoms 
was 
recorded 
for 
23 
children. 


Treatment 
with 
intranasal 
budesonide 
for 
a 
6-week 
period 
in 
48 
children 
with 
mild 
OSAS 
was 
associated 
with 
significant 
improvements 
in 
several 
PSG 
abnormalities, 
namely 
OAHI, 
RAI, 
and 
nadir 
SpO2, 
along 
with 
significant 
changes 
in 
some 
measures 
that 
pertain 
to 
sleep 
macroarchitecture, 
such 
as 
sleep 
latency, 
and 
the 
percentage 
of 
TST 
spent 
in 
either 
slow-wave 
sleep 
or 
rapid-eye-movement 
sleep 
(Table 
2). 
In 
addition, 
significant 
reductions 
in 
adenoid 
size 
occurred 
with 
decreases 
in 
adenoidal 
nasopharyngeal 
ratio 
(N/P) 
ratio 
from 
0.71 
. 
0.02 
before 
treatment 
to 
0.57 
. 
0.02 
after 
6 
weeks 
of 
budesonide 
therapy 
(P 
. 
.0001). 
Moreover 
and 
as 
shown 
in 
Fig 
2, 
26 
(54.1%) 
children 
had 
normalization 
of 
their 
OAHI 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
currently 
accepted 
criteria 
(ie, 
OAHI 
. 
1 
per 
hour 
of 
TST).34,37 
These 
findings 
contrasted 
with 
the 
32 
children 
in 
the 
placebo-treated 
control 
group 
for 
whom 
no 
changes 
occurred 
for 
most 
of 
the 
measurements, 
except 
for 
mild 
worsening 
of 
OAHI 
(P 
. 
.04; 
Table 
2 
and 
Fig 
2). 
Of 
note, 
there 
were 
no 
differences 
in 
the 
responses 
to 
treatment 
either 
for 
obese 
versus 
nonobese 
children 
or 
among 
children 
who 
had 
a 
history 
of 
allergic 
symptoms 
as 
compared 
with 
those 
who 
did 
not 
report 
any 
allergic 
problems, 
and 
there 
were 
no 
discernible 
differences 
in 
the 
response 
to 
therapy 
according 
to 
age. 
A 
total 
of 
5 
adverse 
events 
were 
reported, 
namely 
migraine 
(n 
. 
2), 
diarrhea 
(n 
. 
2), 
and 
vomiting 
and 
diarrhea 
(n 
. 
1). 
Three 
of 
these 
adverse 
events 
occurred 
in 
the 
treatment 
group 
and 
2 
in 
the 
control 
group. 
All 
events 
were 
minor, 
did 
not 
require 
withdrawal 
from 
the 
study, 
and 
were 
considered 
as 
being 
unrelated 
to 
the 
underlying 
OSA 
or 
to 
the 
treatment.

As 
mentioned, 
25 
children 
who 
were 
randomly 
assigned 
to 
the 
initial 
treatment 
arm 
completed 
the 
second 
phase 
of 
the 
protocol 
and 
therefore 
allowed 
for 
assessment 
of 
whether 
discontinuation 
of 
intranasal 
budesonide 
for 
a 
period 
of 
8 
weeks 
(2 
weeks 
of 
washout 
followed 
by 
6 
weeks 
of 
placebo) 
would 
be 
accompanied 
by 
a 
rebound 
in 
the 
severity 
of 
OSAS. 
As 
shown 
in 
Table 
3, 
no 
significant 
changes 
emerged 
during 
this 
follow-up 
period 
in 
PSG 
characteristics, 
degree 
of 
respiratory 
disturbance, 
or 
adenoid 
size. 


DISCUSSION 


This 
study 
clearly 
showed 
that 
intranasal 
budesonide 
administered 
during 
a 
period 
of 
6 
weeks 
to 
children 
with 
mild 
OSA 
effectively 
alleviated 
the 
severity 
of 
respiratory 
disturbance, 
reduced 
the 
size 
of 
adenoid 
tissues, 
and 
significantly 
improved, 
albeit 
slightly, 
some 
components 
of 
sleep 
architecture. 
Furthermore, 
discontinuation 
of 
the 
therapy 
for 
a 
period 
of 
8 
weeks 
did 
not 
seem 
to 
be 
associated 
with 
worsening 
of 
sleep 
or 
respiratory 
parameters. 


Before 
discussing 
the 
potential 
implications 
of 
our 
findings, 
some 
technical 
aspects 
of 
this 
study 
deserve 
comment. 
First, 
we 
enrolled 
as 
part 
of 
our 
study 
design 
only 
patients 
who 
had 
mild 
symptoms 
and 
whose 
PSG 
findings 
were 
in 
the 
very 
mild 
range 
of 
respiratory 
disturbance. 
As 
such, 
we 
could 
a 
priori 
only 
expect 
a 
very 
limited 
theoretical 
range 
of 
improvement 
in 
either 
the 
respiratory 
abnormalities 
or 
the 
sleep 
architecture 
disturbances; 
therefore, 
the 
obvious 
improvements 
that 
resulted 
from 
the 
intervention 
with 
intranasal 
budesonide 
and 
their 
conspicuous 
absence 
when 
placebo 
was 
administered 
emerge 
as 
all 
the 
more 
remarkable. 
Second, 
we 
used 
a 
double-blind 
crossover 
study 
design 
that 
not 
only 
permitted 
objective 
assessment 
of 
the 
effects 
of 
intranasal 
budesonide 
but 
also 
allowed 
for 
determination 
as 
to 
whether 
such 
effect 
is 
restricted 
to 
the 
duration

of

or 
will 
persist 
beyond

of 
intranasal 
budesonide. 
Third, 
we 
included 
children 
with 
mild 
allergic 
symptoms 
and 
found 
that 
the 
response 
to 
therapy 
did 
not 
differ 
among 
those 
with 
and 
without 
those 
symptoms. 


The 
use 
of 
topical 
steroid 
therapy 
in 
pediatric 
OSAS 
is 
not 
novel, 
particularly 
when 
considering 
that 
surgical 
extirpation 
of 
hypertrophic 
adenoids 
and 
tonsils 
for 
OSAS 
not 
only 
is 
accompanied 
by 
an 
increased 
risk 
for 
potential 
postoperative 
complications 
and 
emotional 
distress 
for 
the 
patient 
and 
family 
but 
also 
is 
associated 
with 
increased 
health-related 
costs; 
therefore, 
it 
is 
not 
surprising 
that 
nasal 
corticosteroids 
have 
been 
proposed 
in 
recent 
years 
for 
the 
treatment 
of 
children 
with 
OSAS. 
Indeed, 
Brouillette 
et 
al27 
examined 
this 
issue 
in 
patients 
with 
moderate-to-severe 
OSAS 
before 
undergoing 
T&A 
and 
found 
significant 
improvements 
in 
respiratory 
disturbance 
after 
a 
6-week 
treatment 
with 
intranasal 
fluticasone, 
albeit 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
discernible 
changes 
in 
the 
size 
of 
adenoids. 
Subsequent 
studies 
of 
patients 
with 
milder 
OSAS 
have 
suggested 
a 
similarly 
beneficial 
effect; 
however, 
these 
studies 
were 
“open 
label” 
in 
nature, 
such 
that 
the 
improvements 
in 
sleep-related 
respiratory 
disturbances 
that 
were 
documented 
after 
either 
3 
or 
4 
weeks 
of 
therapy 
with 
nasal 
budesonide 
were 
fraught 
with 
the 
traditional 
limitations 
inherent 
to 
any 
interventional 
study 
that 
uses 
an 
open-label 
design.28,29 
It 
is 
interesting 
that 
Alexopoulos 
et 
al28 
followed 
their 
27-patient 
cohort 
for 
up 
to 
9 
months 
after 
discontinuation 
of 
the 
treatment, 
and 
similar 
to 
the 
findings 
in 
our 
study, 
these 
investigators 
reported 
a 
sustained 
effect 
for 
this 
temporally 
restricted 
intervention, 
although 
they 
assessed 
only 
for 
OSAS-related 
symptoms 
rather 
than 
conducting 
the 
more 
objective 
overnight 
sleep 
studies 
and

radiologic 
assessments 
of 
adenoid 
size. 
Notwithstanding, 
the 
initial 
estimates 
of 
adenoid 
size 
in 
the 
study 
by 
Alexopoulos 
et 
al28 
and 
in 
that 
by 
Brouillette 
et 
al27 
were 
remarkably 
similar 
to 
those 
reported 
for 
our 
cohort 
(N/P 
ratios 
of 
0.72, 
0.76, 
and 
0.71, 
respectively). 
Similarly, 
these 
2 
previously 
published 
studies 
reported 
improvements 
revolving 
around 
40% 
to 
60% 
in 
the 
severity 
of 
OSAS, 
and 
such 
improvement 
was 
54.1% 
in 
our 
study. 
Thus, 
although 
differences 
in 
the 
severity 
of 
OSAS, 
selection 
criteria, 
and 
the 
overall 
method 
make 
accurate 
comparisons 
difficult, 
the 
overall 
outcomes 
are 
consistently 
strikingly 
similar 
and 
support 
a 
role 
for 
the 
use 
of 
nasal 
corticosteroids 
in 
pediatric 
OSAS 
as 
a 
first-line 
option; 
however, 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
limited 
currently 
published 
evidence, 
it 
remains 
unclear 
what 
is 
the 
optimal 
dosage 
and 
duration 
of 
therapy 
using 
intranasal 
steroids, 
whether 
particular 
patients 
(eg, 
younger, 
nonobese) 
would 
be 
more 
likely 
to 
benefit 
from 
this 
therapeutic 
option, 
and 
whether 
addition 
of 
other 
anti-
inflammatory 
agents 
such 
as 
leukotriene 
receptor 
antagonists38,39 
may 
provide 
additive 
or 
synergistic 
effects. 
Furthermore, 
it 
is 
unknown 
whether 
early-phase 
topical 
steroid 
therapy 
will 
ultimately 
improve 
the 
surgical 
outcomes 
of 
T&A 
in 
more 
severely 
affected 
children 
with 
OSAS.40 
In 
addition, 
the 
absence 
of 
discernible 
differences 
in 
the 
response 
to 
intranasal 
steroid 
therapy 
among 
children 
with 
and 
without 
allergic 
rhinitis 
was 
somewhat 
surprising, 
because 
we 
expected 
improved 
responses 
among 
those 
with 
allergic 
nasal 
symptoms, 
particularly 
considering 
the 
important 
role 
of 
the 
nose 
in 
upper 
airway 
collapsibility. 
We 
should 
emphasize, 
however, 
that 
such 
observation 
may 
be 
explained 
to 
some 
extent 
by 
the 
possibility 
that 
this 
study 
may 
be 
underpowered 
to 
draw 
such 
a 
conclusion 
definitively. 


CONCLUSIONS 


We 
have 
learned 
in 
recent 
years 
that 
even 
mild 
cases 
of 
OSAS 
may 
be 
associated 
with 
significant 
cognitive, 
behavioral, 
and 
vascular 
morbidity, 
with 
a 
major 
impact 
on 
quality 
of 
life 
and 
health 
care 
use. 
On 
the 
basis 
of 
this 
compelling 
body 
of 
evidence, 
this 
study 
strongly 
supports 
the 
initiation 
of 
intranasal 
corticosteroid 
therapy 
in 
children 
with 
mild 
OSAS 
as 
the 
first 
step 
in 
the 
treatment 
of 
these 
children. 
To 
somehow 
paraphrase 
Dr 
Marcus 
in 
her 
editorial 
in 
2001 
regarding 
the 
role 
of 
corticosteroids 
in 
pediatric 
OSAS, 
we 
believe 
that 
the 
cumulative 
experience 
regarding 
the 
use 
of 
budesonide 
would 
endorse 
“temporarily 
throwing 
away 
the 
scalpel” 
for 
those 
symptomatic 
children 
with 
mild 
OSAS.41
