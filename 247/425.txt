Summary. Snoring 
is 
often 
found 
in 
allergic 
diseases 
and 
may 
be 
an 
early 
manifestation 
of 
more 
serious 
sleep-disordered 
breathing. 
We 
aimed 
to 
investigate 
whether 
the 
risk 
factors 
for 
snoring 
among 
pre-school 
children 
with 
rhinitis 
are 
similar 
to 
those 
for 
allergic 
diseases 
in 
a 
birth 
cohort. 
The 
study 
cohort 
was 
drawn 
from 
participants 
in 
the 
Childhood 
Asthma 
Prevention 
Study 
(CAPS). 
This 
is 
a 
randomized 
controlled 
trial 
of 
dietary 
intervention 
and 
house 
dust 
mite 
avoidance 
during 
the 
first 
5 
years 
of 
life, 
aimed 
at 
reducing 
the 
riskof 
acquiring 
asthma 
and 
other 
allergic 
conditions 
in 
children 
at 
high-risk 
for 
allergic 
diseases. 
Parents 
of 
children 
with 
symptoms 
of 
rhinitis 
at 
age 
5 
years 
(n 
¼ 
219 
out 
of 
516 
cohort 
members) 
were 
asked 
if 
their 
child 
snored: 
127 
(60%) 
reported 
some 
snoring 
and 
56 
(26%) 
snored 
more 
than 
three 
times 
per 
week. 
Multiple 
logistic 
regression 
analyses 
indicated 
that 
children 
who 
were 
first-born 
(adjusted 
odds 
ratio, 
2.50, 
95% 
CI 
1.20–5.21), 
were 
exposed 
to 
maternal 
tobacco 
smoke 
during 
the 
first 
year 
of 
life 
(2.40, 
1.1–5.25), 
or 
who 
had 
asthma 
(2.51, 
1.14–5.55) 
and/or 
eczema 
(2.29, 
1.02–5.13) 
at 
age 
5 
years 
were 
more 
likely 
to 
snore. 
Birth-weight, 
body 
mass 
index 
at 
age 
4.5, 
spirometry, 
and 
breastfeeding 
were 
not 
related 
to 
snoring. 
Risk 
factors 
for 
snoring 
are 
similar 
to 
risk 
factors 
for 
allergic 
disorders. 
Snoring 
may 
be 
part 
of 
the 
allergic 
spectrum 
of 
diseases. 
Our 
data 
may 
contribute 
to 
clinician’s 
ability 
to 
effectively 
screen 
for 
snoring 
in 
preschool 
children.

Briefly, 
pregnant 
women 
whose 
unborn 
child 
would 
have 
at 
least 
one 
parent 
or 
sibling 
with 
current 
asthma 
or 
frequent 
wheeze 
were 
recruited 
from 
antenatal 
clinics 
of 
six 
hospitals 
in 
Sydney, 
Australia. 
Of 
7,171 
pregnant 
women 
screened, 
2,095 
(29%) 
were 
eligible 
for 
inclusion 
and, 
of 
these, 
616 
(29% 
of 
those 
eligible 
and 
9% 
of 
those 
initially 
screened) 
were 
finally 
enrolled. 
The 
subjects 
(49.4% 
girls, 
50.6% 
boys) 
were 
born 
between 
September 
1997 
and 
January 
2000. 
Women 
were

Data 
on

conducted 
at 
3 
monthly 
intervals 
during 
the 
first 
12 
months 
and 
then 
once 
every 
6 
months 
until 
the 
child 
was 
aged 
5 
years. 
Information 
on 
breastfeeding 
was 
obtained 
from 
dietary 
questionnaires 
administered 
at 
these 
assessment 
times 
during 
the 
first 
12 
months. 


Assessments 

At 
5 
years, 
one 
or 
both 
parents 
were 
interviewed 
about 
symptoms 
and 
diagnoses 
relevant 
to 
asthma 
and 
allergic 
disease, 
and 
the 
children 
underwent 
skin 
prick 
tests 
to 
assess 
allergic 
sensitization 
and 
performed 
pre-and 
postbronchodilator 
spirometry. 


Spirometric 
function 
was 
measured 
before, 
and 
10 
min 
after, 
the 
administration 
of 
albuterol 
200 
mg 
via 
a 
large 
volume 
spacer 
using 
a 
Spirocard 
(QRS 
Diagnostic, 
LLC, 
Plymouth, 
MN) 
device 
linked 
to 
a 
laptop 
computer. 
The 
procedure 
was 
performed 
with 
the 
child 
standing, 
wearing 
a 
nose 
clip 
and 
in 
accordance 
with 
American 
Thoracic 
Society 
recommendations, 
except 
that 
a 
6 
sec 
expiratory 
time 
criterion 
was 
not 
applied. 
The 
highest 
value 
for 
forced 
expiratory 
volume 
in 
1 
sec 
(FEV1) 
from 
at 
least 
three 
acceptable 
manoeuvres 
was 
used 
for 
analysis. 


Sensitization 
was 
measured 
using 
skin 
prick 
tests 
to 
the 
inhalant 
allergens 
Dermatophagoides 
pteronyssinus 
(DP, 
House 
Dust 
Mite), 
cockroach, 
cat, 
Alternaria 
alternata, 
rye 
grass 
and 
a 
grass 
mix 
and 
the 
ingested 
allergens 
salmon, 
peanuts, 
cow’s 
milk, 
egg, 
and 
tuna 
(Hollister-
Stier, 
Spokane, 
WA). 
Glycerine 
and 
histamine 
(6 
mg/ml) 
were 
used 
as 
negative 
and 
positive 
controls, 
respectively. 
The 
weal 
size 
was 
measured, 
at 
10 
min, 
as 
the 
mean 
of 
the 
largest 
diameter 
and 
its 
perpendicular, 
each 
measured 
to 
the 
nearest 
mm. 
Weal 
sizes 
2 
mm 
and 
>negative 
control 
were 
defined 
as 
positive. 
Atopy 
was 
defined 
as 
the 
presence 
of 
any 
positive 
allergen 
weal. 


Definitions of Symptoms, Exposure 
Variables, and Confounders 

Rhinitis 
status 
was 
ascertained 
at 
age 
5 
years 
using 
the 
question 
‘‘In 
the 
last 
12 
months 
has 
your 
child 
had 
a 
problem 
with 
itchy 
nose, 
sneezing 
or 
a 
runny 
or 
blocked 
nose 
which 
lasted 
for 
1 
week 
or 
more? 
(YES/NO).’’ 


Snoring 
status 
was 
ascertained 
among 
children 
with 
rhinitis 
at 
age 
5 
years. 
Parents 
were 
asked 
whether 
their 
child 
snored 
(YES/NO) 
and, 
if 
so, 
how 
frequently. 
The 
responses 
were 
classified 
as 
‘‘every 
night,’’ 
‘‘more 
than 
three 
nights 
per 
week,’’ 
‘‘more 
than 
once 
per 
week,’’ 
and 
‘‘less 
than 
once 
per 
week.’’ 
For 
analysis, 
these 
responses 
were 
recoded 
into 
two 
dichotomous 
variables: 
‘‘snorer’’ 
versus 
‘‘non-snorer’’ 
(from 
the 
YES/NO 
question) 
and 
‘‘habitual 
snorer’’ 
versus 
‘‘not 
an 
habitual 
snorer’’ 
(where 
‘‘every 
night’’ 
and 
‘‘snoring 
at 
least 
three 
nights 
per 
week’’ 
was 
coded 
as 
habitual 
snorer 
and 
‘‘snoring 
less 
frequently 
or 
not 
at 
all’’ 
was 
coded 
as 
not 
an 
habitual 
snorer). 
We 



586 Marshall et al. 

also 
coded 
an 
ordinal 
scale 
which 
ranged 
from 
0 
¼ 
‘‘No 
Snoring’’ 
to 
4 
¼ 
‘‘Every 
night 
snoring’’ 
with 
other 
frequencies 
of 
snoring 
appropriately 
coded 
in-between. 


We 
defined 
probable 
current 
asthma 
at 
age 
5 
years 
as 
parental 
report 
of 
any 
wheeze 
in 
the 
previous 
12 
months 
at 
age 
5 
years 
and 
either 
a 
parental 
report 
of 
diagnosed 
asthma 
at 
ages 
18 
months, 
3 
years, 
or 
5 
years 
or 
a 
>12% 
increase 
in 
FEV1 
after 
bronchodilator 
at 
age 
5 
years. 
Current 
eczema 
was 
defined 
as 
the 
presence 
of 
flexural 
eczema 
on 
inspection 
(by 
the 
assessment 
nurse) 
or 
by 
parental 
report 
of 
a 
history 
of 
itchy 
rash 
coming 
and 
going 
for 
a 
period 
of 
3 
months 
or 
more 
together 
with 
a 
history 
of 
seeking 
medical 
care 
for 
eczema 
and/or 
using 
steroid 
or 
emollient 
creams 
in 
the 
last 
12 
months. 


Breastfeeding 
was 
classified 
as 
ever 
having 
been 
breastfed 
and 
as 
having 
been 
breastfed 
for 
6 
months 
or 
more. 
It 
was 
also 
measured 
as 
a 
continuous 
variable 
quantifying 
the 
duration 
of 
breastfeeding 
(up 
to 
1 
year). 


Quantitative 
data 
on 
smoking 
within 
the 
home 
by 
the 
child’s 
mother 
and 
by 
other 
household 
members 
was 
collected 
by 
parental 
interview 
at 
home 
during 
the 
pregnancy 
(at 
36 
weeks 
gestation), 
at 
1, 
3, 
6, 
9, 
and 
12 
months 
after 
the 
child’s 
birth 
and 
then 
at 
6 
monthly 
intervals 
until 
the 
child 
was 
5 
years 
old. 
Three 
exposures 
to 
environmental 
tobacco 
smoke 
(ETS) 
were 
investigated 
for 
their 
risk 
of 
increasing 
snoring. 
These 
were 
any 
smoking 
during 
pregnancy, 
any 
smoking 
by 
the 
mother 
during 
the 
first 
year 
of 
life, 
and 
any 
exposure 
to 
ETS 
during 
the 
first 
5 
years 
of 
life. 


Statistical Analyses 

Analyses 
were 
undertaken 
in 
SAS 
v.9.1 
(SAS 
Institute, 
Cary, 
NC). 
Contingency 
tables 
were 
constructed 
and 
logistic 
regression 
analyses 
were 
performed 
to 
estimate 
univariate 
and 
multivariate 
(adjusted) 
odds 
ratios. 


In 
the 
multivariate 
models 
we 
included 
those 
variables 
that 
were 
significant 
in 
the 
univariate 
analyses 
as 
well 
as 
some 
other 
variables 
that 
had 
been 
shown 
in 
previous 
studies 
to 
be 
associated 
either 
with 
snoring 
or 
allergic 
disease 
or 
could 
conceivably 
confound 
the 
association 
with 
the 
main 
independent 
predictors 
and 
snoring. 
All 
multivariate 
models 
were 
also 
adjusted 
for 
the 
intervention 
group 
the 
child 
had 
been 
assigned 
to 
in 
the 
randomized 
controlled 
trial. 
Three 
multivariate 
models 
were 
tested. 
The 
first 
and 
second 
models 
(Table 
1) 
investigated 
risk 
factors 
for 
any 
level 
of 
snoring 
versus 
no 
reported 
snoring. 
The 
second 
model 
excluded 
coassociated 
allergic 
outcomes 
(asthma, 
eczema, 
and 
atopy) 
in 
order 
to 
assess 
the 
effects 
of 
risk 
factors 
without 
these 
other 
allergic 
endpoints. 
The 
third 
model 
(Table 
2) 
employed 
the 
same 
risk 
factors 
that 
were 
present 
in 
the 
first 
model 
but 
the 
dependent 
variable 
was 
habitual 
snoring 
status. 
Models 
presented 
in 
both 
tables 
were 
tested 
for 
the 
following 
two-way 
interactions 
between 
the 
covariates: 
mother’s 
age 
by 
birth 
order, 
mother’s 
age 
by 


breastfeeding, 
mother’s 
age 
by 
mother’s 
smoking 
during 
first 
12 
months, 
mother’s 
smoking 
by 
breastfeeding 
and 
birth 
order 
by 
breastfeeding. 
Multi-colinearity 
was 
investigated 
using 
the 
variance 
inflation 
factor. 
Dose-
response 
relationships 
between 
the 
severity 
of 
snoring 
and 
continuous 
variables 
were 
investigated 
by 
ANOVA. 


The 
relationship 
between 
snoring 
status 
and 
spirometric 
function 
was 
analyzed 
using 
the 
general 
linear 
model 
with 
the 
child’s 
height 
and 
gender 
as 
covariates. 


RESULTS 

Rhinitis 

Of 
the 
516 
children 
who 
were 
assessed 
at 
age 
5 
years, 
219 
(42%) 
reported 
rhinitis 
within 
the 
last 
year. 
Information 
on 
snoring 
was 
available 
for 
213 
(97%) 
of 
these 
219 
children. 


Snoring Prevalence 

Any 
snoring 
was 
reported 
in 
127 
(59.6%) 
of 
213 
children. 
These 
included 
38 
(17.8%) 
who 
snored 
less 
than 
once 
a 
week, 
33 
(15.5%) 
who 
snored 
more 
than 
once 
a 
week, 
31 
(14.6%) 
who 
snored 
more 
than 
3 
nights 
a 
week, 
and 
25 
(11.7%) 
who 
snored 
every 
night. 


Asthma, Eczema, and Atopy 

Probable 
current 
asthma, 
current 
eczema 
and 
parental 
history 
of 
asthma 
were 
significant 
risk 
factors 
for 
snoring 
(Table 
1). 
However, 
in 
multivariate 
models 
parental 
history 
of 
asthma 
was 
not 
an 
independent 
predictor, 
after 
inclusion 
of 
the 
child’s 
current 
asthma 
status 
(Table 
1). 
Skin 
prick 
test 
data 
were 
available 
for 
202 
of 
the 
213 
children. 
The 
presence 
of 
atopy 
was 
not 
a 
significant 
risk 
factor 
for 
snoring 
in 
these 
children 
with 
rhinitis 
OR 
1.39 
(95% 
CI 
0.79–2.47). 


Breastfeeding 

Being 
breastfed 
for 
at 
least 
6 
months 
was 
not 
associated 
with 
snoring 
(Tables 
1 
and 
2). 
The 
frequency 
of 
snoring 
was 
not 
related 
to 
the 
duration 
of 
breastfeeding 
(P 
¼ 
0.78). 


Birth-Order 

Children 
who 
were 
first-born 
in 
their 
family 
were 
significantly 
more 
likely 
to 
be 
snorers 
than 
children 
who 
had 
older 
siblings 
(Table 
1). 
However, 
being 
a 
first 
born 
child 
was 
not 
a 
risk 
factor 
for 
habitual 
snoring 
(Table 
2). 


Environmental Tobacco Smoke 

Among 
the 
indices 
of 
ETS 
exposure, 
the 
largest 
and 
only 
significant 
univariate 
risk 
factor 
for 
snoring 
was 
maternal 
ETS 
exposure 
during 
the 
first 
year 
(OR 
2.08 
95% 
CI 
1.05– 
4.11). 
Smoke 
exposure 
from 
the 
mother 
during 
pregnancy, 
during 
the 
first 
year 
of 
life, 
and 
during 
the 
first 
5 
years 
of 
life

were 
investigated 
independently 
in 
the 
multivariate

These 
multivariate 
odds 
ratios 
for 
association 
with 
snoring 
were 
very 
similar 
to 
the 
univariate 
odds 
ratios. 
However 
due 
to 
colinearity 
among 
the 
ETS 
exposure 
variables 
odds 
ratios 
were 
markedly 
changed 
when 
they 
were 
analyzed 
together. 
The 
strongest 
predictor 
remained 
maternal 
ETS 
exposure 
during 
the 
first 
year. 
Therefore, 
we 
present 
maternal 
ETS 
exposure 
during 
the 
first

of 
life 
as 
the 
key 
ETS 
risk 
factor 
for

DISCUSSION 

Children 
in 
the 
CAPS 
cohort 
with 
rhinitis 
had 
a 
high 
prevalence 
of 
snoring 
at 
least 
once 
per 
week 
at 
age 
5 
years 
(59.6%). 
Independent 
risk 
factors 
for 
snoring 
include 
being 
a 
first-born 
child; 
exposure 
to 
environmental 
tobacco 
smoke, 
particularly 
from 
the 
mother 
during 
the 
child’s 
first 
year 
of 
life; 
and 
the 
co-existence 
of 
asthma 
or 
eczema. 
The 
child’s 
gender, 
the 
mother’s 
age 
when 
the 
child 
was 
born, 
the 
parental 
history 
of 
asthma, 
the 
duration 
of 
breastfeeding 
and 
the 
child’s 
body 
mass 
index, 
atopic 
status 
and 
lung 
function 
at 
age 
5 
years 
were 
not 
found 
to 
be 
independent 
risk 
factors 
for 
snoring 
in 
this 
cohort, 
although 
girls 
with 
rhinitis 
were 
more 
likely 
to 
have 
habitual 
snoring 
than 
boys 
with 
rhinitis. 


The 
prevalence 
of 
habitual 
snoring 
among 
children 
with 
rhinitis 
in 
the 
CAPS 
cohort 
was 
26.3%, 
which 
is 
much 
higher 
than 
the 
10.5% 
reported 
in 
2–5 
year 
olds 
in 
rural 
Australia 
or 
the 
15.2% 
reported 
in 
primary 
school 
children 
living 
in 
Perth, 
Western 
Australia.6,7 
The 
restriction 
of 
this 
cohort 
to 
children 
with 
rhinitis, 
an 
established 
risk 
factor 
for 
snoring,5,7,9,11,12 
is 
the 
probable 
explanation 
for 
the 
high 
prevalence 
of 
snoring. 


We 
have 
demonstrated 
that 
snoring 
in 
children 
with 
rhinitis 
is 
associated 
with 
asthma 
and 
eczema 
and 
also 
with 
risk 
factors 
for 
asthma 
and 
allergic 
disease, 
specifically 
exposure 
to 
ETS 
and 
being 
a 
first-born 
child.

tests, 
is 
probably 
explained 
by 
the 
restriction 
of 
the 
cohort 
to 
children 
with 
rhinitis. 
We 
acknowledge 
that 
the 
association 
between 
asthma 
and 
snoring 
could 
be 
explained 
by 
misclassification 
of 
nocturnal 
wheeze 
as 
snoring, 
or 
vice 
versa 
and 
that 
the 
absence 
of 
an 
association 
between 
snoring 
and 
impaired 
lung 
function 
means 
that 
snoring 
is 
not 
associated 
with 
severe 
asthma. 
However, 
the 
association 
between 
snoring 
with 
eczema 
cannot 
be 
explained 
by 
this 
misclassification. 
These 
findings, 
together 
with 
the 
previously 
reported 
beneficial 
effect 
of 
leukotriene 
receptor 
antagonists 
in 
the 
treatment 
of 
children 
with 
mild 
sleep-disordered 
breathing,18 
are 
consistent 
with 
the 
view 
that 
snoring 
forms 
part 
of 
the 
spectrum 
of 
allergic 
diseases 
in 
childhood. 


Breastfeeding 
might 
promote 
an 
oral 
cavity

a 
wide 
caliber 
that 
reduces

of

occlusion 
during

However, 
the 
role 
of 
breastfeeding 
in 
protecting 
against 
snoring 
and 
sleep 
disordered-
breathing 
has 
not 
been 
directly 
evaluated 
in 
previous 
studies. 
Our 
data 
do 
not 
provide 
support 
for 
the 
contention 
that 
breastfeeding 
protects 
against 
childhood 
snoring, 
at 
least 
in 
children 
with 
rhinitis. 


Exposure 
to 
environmental 
tobacco 
smoke 
(ETS) 
has 
been 
found 
to 
be 
a 
risk 
factor 
for 
snoring 
in 
children.1,7,11–14 
Our 
prospective 
data 
in 
a 
subset 
of 
children 
with 
symptoms 
of 
rhinitis 
confirms 
those 
previous 
cross-
sectional 
observations. 
Furthermore 
the 
relationship 
between 
maternal 
exposure 
to 
ETS 
in 
the 
first 
year 
is 
significant 
in 
both 
of 
the 
snoring 
models 
presented 
and 
remains 
elevated 
in 
the 
model 
of 
habitual 
snoring. 
A 
report 
from 
a 
1-year-old 
birth 
cohort 
did 
not 
find 
an 
association 
between 
ETS 
exposure 
and 
snoring 
but 
concluded 
that 
‘‘a 
critical 
duration 
of 
ETS 
exposure 
may 
be 
necessary 
before 
this 
association 
can 
be 
detected’’.8 
Our 
findings 
are 
congruent 
with 
this 
hypothesis. 
Our 
observations 
help 
to 
prospectively 
demonstrate 
that 
exposure 
to 
ETS, 
particularly 
via 
the 
mother 
in 
the 
first 
year, 
is 
a 
risk 
factor 
for 
snoring 
in 
children 
with 
rhinitis 
at 
age 
5. 


We 
found 
that 
first-born 
children 
are 
more 
likely 
to 
snore 
than 
children 
who 
have 
older 
siblings. 
However, 
this 
association 
does 
not 
apply 
to 
habitual 
snoring 
where 
being 
first 
born 
is 
not 
a 
risk 
factor. 
Although 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
this 
finding 
is 
explained 
by 
differential 
reporting 
due 
to 
parents 
being 
more 
sensitive 
to 
occasional 
snoring 
in 
their 
first-born 
child, 
first-born 
children 
have 
been 
consistently 
shown 
to 
be 
at 
higher 
risk 
of 
allergic 
diseases.10 
This 
was 
the 
first 
of 
several 
hygiene-related 
early 
life 
exposures 
that 
have 
been 
shown 
to 
be 
risk 
factors 
for 
asthma 
and 
allergic 
diseases.20–22 
The 
observed 
independent 
association 
between 
infrequent 
snoring 
and 
birth-order 
implies 
that 
hygiene-related 
immunological 
mechanisms 
may 
also 
play 
a 
part 
in 
the 
aetiology 
of 
snoring, 
even 
in 
children 
with 
rhinitis. 


A 
recent 
review 
of 
the 
epidemiology 
of 
sleep-
disordered 
breathing 
concluded 
that 
snoring 
in 
children 
was 
roughly 
equally 
prevalent 
in 
boys 
and 
girls.23 
We 
found 
a 
higher 
risk 
of 
habitual 
snoring 
in 
girls 
although 
the 
difference 
was 
not 
statistically 
significant 
for 
all 
snoring. 
Although, 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
the 
restriction 
of 
the 
cohort 
to 
children 
with 
rhinitis 
may 
have 
altered 
the 
gender 
association 
with 
snoring, 
this 
observation 
may 
be 
yet 
another 
important 
demonstration 
of 
gender 
differences 
in 
the 
course 
of 
allergic 
and 
airway 
diseases 
during 
childhood. 


Although 
the 
association 
between 
obesity 
and 
snoring 
has 
been 
well 
established 
in 
adults23 
and 
school 
age 
children11,14 
our 
findings 
imply 
that 
body 
mass 
is 
not 
an 
important 
contributor 
to 
risk 
of 
snoring 
in 
pre-school 
age 
children. 
It 
seems 
likely 
that 
upper 
airway 
morphology 
and 
the 
manifestations 
of 
allergic 
disease 
are 
more 
important. 



590 Marshall et al. 

Two 
stages 
of 
selection 
applied 
to 
this 
study 
cohort 
will 
influence 
the 
generalizability 
of 
these 
findings. 
The 
CAPS 
cohort 
was 
selected 
to 
have 
a 
high 
risk 
of 
developing 
asthma 
and 
other 
allergic 
diseases 
due 
to 
all 
children 
having 
at 
least 
one 
first-degree 
relative 
with 
asthma. 
The 
analyses 
presented 
here 
are 
further 
limited 
to 
children 
whose 
parents 
reported 
that 
they 
had 
a 
‘‘a 
problem 
with 
itchy 
nose, 
sneezing 
or 
a 
runny 
or 
blocked 
nose 
which 
lasted 
for 
1 
week 
or 
more’’ 
in 
the 
last 
year. 
We 
have 
labeled 
this 
condition 
as 
rhinitis 
although 
we 
acknowledge 
that 
other 
upper 
airway 
pathology 
may 
explain 
this 
symptom 
in 
children. 
This 
selection 
process 
means 
that 
prevalence 
estimates 
are 
not 
applicable 
to 
the 
general 
population. 
However, 
it 
will 
have 
less 
impact 
on 
the 
interpretation 
of 
the 
observed 
associations 
with 
risk 
factors, 
except 
that 
those 
characteristics 
or 
exposures 
that 
are 
strongly 
correlated 
with 
the 
presence 
of 
rhinitis 
or 
a 
family 
history 
of 
asthma 
may 
be 
under-estimated 
as 
potential 
risk 
factors 
for 
snoring. 


The 
relatively 
small 
size 
of 
the 
study 
cohort 
means 
that 
non-significant 
associations 
need 
to 
be 
interpreted 
with 
caution. 
Tables 
1 
and 
2 
demonstrate 
that 
confidence 
intervals 
around 
the 
effect 
estimates 
are 
broad 
and 
do 
not 
exclude 
the 
possibility 
that 
a 
larger 
study 
would 
show 
clinically 
relevant, 
significant 
associations 
between 
snoring 
and 
additional 
risk 
factors. 


The 
lack 
of 
any 
objective 
measure 
of 
snoring 
is 
an 
important 
potential 
limitation 
of 
these 
analyses. 
However, 
unlike 
adults 
and 
older 
children, 
children 
aged 
5 
years 
and 
younger 
are 
commonly 
observed 
during 
all 
stages 
of 
sleep 
by 
their 
parents 
and 
others 
and 
frequent 
or 
habitual 
snoring 
has 
been 
shown 
to 
be 
a 
highly 
sensitive 
and 
specific 
measure 
of 
in-laboratory 
measured 
snoring 
in 
preschool 
and 
early 
school-age 
children.9 
In 
that 
study, 
many 
children 
whose 
parents 
reported 
occasional 
snoring 
did 
not 
have 
snoring 
on 
polysomnography 
(low 
specificity). 
This 
is 
not 
unexpected, 
since 
the 
sleep 
study 
only 
measured 
one 
night 
and 
the 
parental 
report 
implies 
that 
the 
occurrences 
are 
episodic 
and 
may 
not 
have 
occurred 
on 
the 
night 
of 
the 
sleep 
study. 
Hence, 
parental 
report, 
as 
used 
in 
this 
study, 
is 
probably 
a 
valid 
measure 
of 
snoring 
in 
young 
children. 


Obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
syndrome 
is 
a 
common 
condition 
in 
childhood 
and 
can 
result 
in 
severe 
complications 
if 
left 
untreated. 
There 
are 
guidelines 
to 
enhance 
the 
primary 
care 
clinician’s 
ability 
to 
recognize 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
syndrome 
and 
our 
data 
may 
contribute 
to 
their 
ability 
to 
comply 
with 
recommendations 
to 
screen 
for 
snoring 
at 
well-child’s 
visits.3,4 


We 
have 
shown 
that 
snoring 
is 
common 
among 
children 
with 
rhinitis. 
In 
these 
children 
snoring 
is 
associated 
with 
asthma 
and 
eczema 
and 
shares 
some 
of 
the 
common 
risk 
factors 
for 
allergic 
diseases. 
Snoring 
in 
children 
may 
be 
regarded 
as 
part 
of 
the 
spectrum 
of 
allergic 
diseases.
