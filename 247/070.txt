SUMMARY 
Several 
studies 
have 
emphasized 
the 
role 
of 
familial 
factors 
and 
familial 
aggregation 
in 
increasing 
susceptibility 
to 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
syndrome 
(OSAS); 
the 
aim 
of 
the 
present 
study 
was 
to 
investigate 
the 
possible 
influence 
of 
human 
leukocyte 
antigen 
(HLA) 
in 
the 
development 
of 
sleep 
disordered 
breathing 
and 
OSAS 
of 
children. 
Between 
January 
2000 
and 
January 
2003, 
all 
the 
370 
children 
[193 
males; 
median 
age: 


5.2 
years 
(range: 
1–12 
years)] 
with 
sleep 
disordered 
breathing 
referred 
to 
our 
Center 
were 
screened 
by 
a 
41-item 
multiple-choice 
questionnaire. 
All 
habitual 
snores 
children 
underwent 
a 
polisomnographic 
evaluation, 
and 
those 
with 
an 
apnea/hypopnea 
index 
>3 
were 
diagnosed 
as 
having 
OSAS. 
All 
children 
with 
OSAS 
or 
primary 
snoring 
were 
HLA 
typied 
for 
class 
I 
and 
II. 
According 
to 
nocturnal 
polygraphic 
monitoring 
study, 
41 
patients 
were 
diagnosed 
as 
having 
OSAS 
and 
32 
as 
primary 
snoring. 
Patients 
in 
the 
two 
diagnostic 
groups 
were 
homogeneous 
for 
demographic 
and 
clinical 
characteristics. 
HLA-B65 
was 
found 
to 
be 
significantly 
more 
expressed 
in 
children 
with 
sleep 
disordered 
breathing 
as 
compared 
with 
controls 
(10.5% 
versus 
3.61; 
Pypc 
< 
0.04) 
while 
no 
difference 
was 
found 
for 
the 
other 
tested 
antigens. 
A 
logistic 
regression 
analysis 
found 
cough 
(P 
< 
0.02) 
and 
persistent 
wheeze 
(P 
< 
0.008) 
the 
sole 
risk 
factors 
for 
OSAS 
development. 
Our 
preliminary 
data 
suggest 
that 
HLA 
does 
not 
play 
a 
key 
role 
in 
the 
pathogenesis 
of 
OSAS, 
however 
more 
studies 
are 
needed 
to 
clarify 
this 
issue.

The 
human 
leukocyte 
antigen 
(HLA) 
is 
an 
objective 
genetic 
marker 
that 
may 
be 
implicated 
in 
the 
pathogenesis 
of 
a 
disease 
per 
se. 
or 
through 
a 
gene 
within 
the 
major 
histocompatibility 
complex 
that 
may 
contribute 
to 
disease 
susceptibility 
(Lechler 
and 
Warrens, 
2000). 
Recent 
studies 
have 
indeed, 
demonstrated 
a 
HLA 
association 
between 
narcolepsy 
(Lin 
et 
al., 
2001; 
Mignot 
and 
Thorsby, 
2001) 
with 
particular 
emphasis 
on 
cataplexic 
narcolepsy 
(Krahn 
et 
al., 
2002). 
However, 
just 
one 
Japanese 
study 
has 
shown 
an 
increased 
prevalence 
of 
HLA-A2 
in 
patients 
with 
OSAS 
as 
compared 
with 
healthy 
individuals; 
this 
study 
however, 
was 
biased 
by 
the 
presence 
of 
a 
significantly 
higher 
number 
of 
obese 
individuals 
among 
the 
patients 
with 
OSAS 
as 
compared 
with 
controls 
(Yoshizawa 
et 
al., 
1993). 


The 
aim 
of 
our 
study 
was 
to 
attempt 
to 
define 
specific 
genetic 
polymorphisms 
associated 
with 
sleep 
disordered 
breathing 
in 
an 
unselected 
and 
homogeneous 
group 
of

with

and

METHODS 


Between 
January 
2000 
and 
January 
2003, 
all 
the 
370 
consecutive 
children 
with 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
(SDB) 
[193 
M 
(52.2%); 
median 
age: 
5.2 
years 
(range 
1–12 
years)], 
referred 
to 
our 
Service 
by 
general 
practitioners 
or 
pediatricians 
from 
our 
region 
(Apulia), 
were 
offered 
to 
entry 
in 
this 
prospective 
study; 
children 
coming 
from 
different 
Italian 
regions, 
were 
not 
included. 
All 
complained 
symptoms 
of 
excessive 
snoring, 
oral 
breathing, 
daily 
sleepiness 
and, 
apnoeic

during 
sleep. 
Demographic 
characteristics 
of 
the 
370 
children 
with 
SDB 
are 
reported 
in 
Table 
1. 


In 
order 
to 
diagnose 
the 
cause 
of 
SDB, 
all 
children 
underwent 
a 
diagnostic 
stepwise 
approach 
previously 
described 
by 
us 
(Brunetti 
et 
al., 
2001) 
based 
on 
a 
questionnaire 
followed 
by 
polisomnographic 
home 
evaluation 
and 
nocturnal 
polygraphic 
monitoring 
(NPM) 
as 
appropriate. 
In 
particular, 
a 
41-item 
multiple-choice 
questionnaire, 
formulated 
according 
to 
the 
Brouillette’s 
guidelines 
(Brouillette 
et 
al., 
1982, 
1984) 
revised 
by 
Carroll 
et 
al. 
(1995), 
was 
distributed 
to 
children. 
Questions 
were 
aimed 
to 
score 
the 
severity 
of 
sleep-related 
symptoms 
according 
to 
a 
4-point 
scale. 
In 
the 
following 
statistical 
evaluation, 
scores 
of 
3 
(always) 
were 
defined 
as

in 
order 
to

of 
the

According 
to 
American 
Sleep 
Disorders 
Association 
relative 
to 
screening 
methodologies 
(American 
Sleep 
Disorders 
Association, 
1994), 
the 
following 
parameters 
were 
monitored: 
(a)

saturation 
of 
oxygen; 
(b) 
heart 
rate 
(through 
ECG); 
(c) 
snoring; 
(d)

Recordings 
with 
an

(ODI) 
>2 
were 
regarded 
as 
suggestive 
of 
OSAS 
(Marcus 
et

1992) 
and 
children 
were 
then 
considered 
eligible 
for

The 
Apulian 
HLA 
Distribution 
Study, 
the 
largest 
HLA

survey 
in 
our 
region 
[Apulia, 
a 
region 
of 
Southern 
Italy 
(19 
357 
km2; 
4 
087 
000 
inhabitants)] 
was 
started 
in 
the 
1990s 
for 
the 
Italian 
Bone 
Marrow 
Donor 
Registry 
and, 
therefore, 
is, 
at 
present, 
the 
most 
accurate 
scenario 
of 
the 
HLA 
phenotype 
of 
our 
population 
(http://www.ibmdr. 
galliera.it/). 
The 
aim 
of 
that 
study 
was 
to 
analyze 
the 
genetic 
structure 
of 
the 
Italian 
bone 
marrow 
donor 
population 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
HLA 
polymorphisms. 
The 
Italian 
population 
study 
offered 
a 
great 
contribution 
to 
anthropological, 
epidemiological 
studies 
as 
well 
as 
to 
population 
genetics 
(Borelli 
et 
al., 
1998). 
Italy 
is 
a 
country 
with 
high 
antigen 
variability 
(Dyer 
and 
Middleton, 
1993) 
which 
is 
more 
pronounced 
in 
the 
Apulia 
region 
(Piazza 
et 
al., 
1989) 
which 
on 
account 
of 
his 
geographical 
position, 
in 
the 
past 
centuries, 
has 
been 
invaded 
several 
times 
by 
Hispanic, 
Arabs 
and 
Saracens 
(Piazza 
et 
al., 
1988). 
For 
this 
reason 
it 
is 
of 
paramount 
importance 
to 
have 
a 
control 
group 
from 
the 
same 
geographic 
area. 
The 
Apulian 
HLA 
distribution 
study 
lasted 
over 
a 
decade 
to 
assess 
the 
HLA 
antigen 
frequencies 
in 
Apulia, 
testing 
a 
total 
of 
6156 
(0.15%) 
and 
1183 
(0.03%) 
subjects 
in 
a 
healthy 
Apulian 
population 
(HAP) 
for 
HLA 
class 
I 
and 
II 
respectively.

were 
homogenously 
distributed 
across 
gender 
and 
age 
[F: 
51.2%; 
median 
age: 
28.2 
years 
(range: 
18–65)]. 


Statistics 


All 
data 
are 
expressed 
as 
median 
with 
a 
range. 
The 
statistical 
analysis 
was 
performed 
using 
the 
Number 
Cruncher 
Statistical 
System 
(NCSS 
11.0) 
program 
(NCSS, 
Kaysville, 
UT, 
USA). 
The 
v 
2, 
the 
non-parametric 
Mann– 
Whitney 
U-test, 
the 
relative 
risk 
(RR), 
the 
odds 
ratios 
(OR) 
and 
the 
95% 
confidence 
interval 
(95% 
CI) 
were 
used 
for 
statistical 
analysis. 
The 
sample 
size 
was 
calculated 
starting 
from 
the 
assumption 
of 
a 
general 
antigen 
frequency 
of 
18% 
in 
the 
HAP 
(as 
assessed 
by 
the 
Apulian 
HLA 
Distribution 
Study) 
aiming 
to 
detect 
a 
difference 
in 
antigens 
frequency 
of 
7% 
with 
a 
power 
of 
80%. 
In 
detail, 
we 
have 
used 
the 
standard 
approach 
for 
the 
identification 
of 
associations 
between 
antigens 
and 
diseases 
as 
described 
by 
Dyer 
and 
Warrens 
(1994) 
by 
using 
a 
2 
· 
2 
contingency 
table. 
to 
estimate 
the 
probability 
that 
the 
pattern 
of 
frequencies 
of 
antigen-positive 
and 
-negative 
cases 
and 
controls 
could 
have 
arisen 
by 
chance 
alone 
followed 
by 
the 
chi-square 
corrected 
with 
Yates 
criterion 
(Py) 
according 
to 
Svejgaard 
et 
al. 
(1983). 
To 
account 
for 
the 
problem 
of 
significant 
associations 
arising 
by 
chance 
when 
multiple 
comparisons 
are 
made, 
we 
used 
the 
Bonferroni 
correction 
(Bland 
and 


Altman, 
1995), 
which 
accounted 
for 
all 
antigens 
tested. 
To 
identify 
the 
significant 
independent 
variables 
associated 
with 
disease 
risk 
we 
carried 
out 
a 
standard 
logistic 
regression 
analysis. 
A 
probability 
value 
<0.05, 
post-Bonferroni 
correction 
(Pypc), 
was 
considered 
significant. 


RESULTS 


All 
the 
370 
children 
fully 
completed 
the 
questionnaires 
and 
170 
children 
[45.9%; 
91 
M; 
median 
age: 
4.5 
years 
(range: 
1–12 
years)] 
were 
classified 
as 
occasional 
snorers 
and 
200 
children 
[54.1%; 
108 
M; 
median 
age: 
4.1 
years 
(range: 
1–11 
years)] 
as 
habitual 
snorers. 


All 
the 
200 
habitual 
snoring 
children 
underwent 
polisomnographic 
home 
evaluation 
that 
revealed 
82 
children 
[41%; 
43 
M 
median 
age: 
4.3 
years 
(range:1–12 
years)] 
with 
ODI 
>2 
that 
were 
considered 
for 
NPM. 


Of 
the 
82 
children 
eligible 
to 
continue 
the 
study, 
three 
children 
(3.6%) 
refused 
further 
investigations 
following 
spontaneous 
disappearance 
of 
symptoms 
and 
six 
children 
(7.3%) 
underwent 
adenoidectomy 
and/or 
tonsillectomy 
before 
NPM 
because 
of 
worsening 
clinical 
condition 
related 
to 
apneic 
episodes. 
NPM 
revealed 
OSAS 
in 
41 
children 
[(56.2%; 
29 
M; 
median 
age 
3.9 
years 
(range: 
1–11 
years)] 
and 
primary 
snoring 
in 
32 
children 
[43.8%; 
21 
M; 
median 
age 
4.2 
years 
(range: 
2–10 
years)]. 
Patients 
with 
OSAS 
were 
not 
different 
from 
patients 
with 
primary 
snoring 
for 
demographic 
characteristics 
(Table 
2). 


To 
assess 
whether 
HLA 
play 
a 
role 
in 
the 
development 
of 
OSAS, 
we 
have 
compared 
the 
frequency 
of 
HLA 
antigens 
in 
the 
group 
of 
patients 
with 
SDB 
and 
in 
the 
population 
of 
our 
geographic 
area 
as 
assessed 
by 
the 
Apulian 
HLA 
Distribution 
Study 
(Borelli 
et 
al., 
1998). 


When 
we 
compared 
the 
antigen 
frequencies 
of 
patients 
with 
SDB 
as 
compared 
with 
the 
HAP 
we 
found 
a 
significant 
expression 
of 
some 
antigens 
in 
the 
former

however, 
was 
lost 
after 
Bonferroni 
correction

DISCUSSION 


Our 
study 
is 
a 
preliminary 
attempt 
to 
investigate 
the 
possible 
role 
of 
HLA 
in 
the 
pathogenesis 
of 
SDB 
and 
the 
data 
presented 
suggest 
that 
HLA 
does 
not 
play 
a 
direct 
role 
since 
no 
differences 
in 
HLA 
antigens. 
frequencies 
were 
observed 
in 
children 
with 
OSAS 
as 
compared 
with 
children 
with 
primary 
snoring 
and 
healthy 
controls 
of 
our 
geographic 
area. 
The 
hypothesis 
that 
HLA 
could 
be 
involved 
in 
the 


development 
of 
this 
disorders 
derives 
from 
epidemiological 
observations 
that 
SDB 
aggregates 
within 
families 
(Strohl 
et 
al., 
1978). 
Redline 
et 
al. 
(1992) 
demonstrated 
that 
the 
risk 
of 
OSAS 
increases 
parallel 
to 
the 
number 
of 
affected 
relatives 
and 
independently 
from 
non-genetic 
factors 
such 
as 
use 
of 
alcohol 
or 
sedatives, 
caffeine 
intake, 
average 
sleep 
time, 
obesity 
or 
nasal 
allergens. 
This 
finding 
was 
later 
confirmed 
in 
a 
large 
group 
of 
families 
with 
more 
than 
560 
patients 
enrolled 
(Redline 
et 
al., 
1995). 
Although 
many 
attempts 
have 
been 
made 
to 
find 
a 
genetic 
marker 
of 
OSAS, 
at 
present 
only 
one 
Japanese 
study 
investigated 
the 
possible 
role 
of 
HLA. 
The 
authors 
(Yoshizawa 
et 
al., 
1993) 
have 
analyzed 
the 
distribution 
of 
HLA 
antigens 
in 
32 
Japanese 
males 
with 
OSAS 
and 
found 
that 
the 
frequency 
of 
HLA-A2 
was 
markedly 
increased 
in 
patients, 
as 
compared 
to 
the 
healthy 
Japanese 
population. 
However, 
no 
pathophysiologic 
mechanism 
by 
which 
specific 
HLA 
antigens 
may 
cause 
sleep 
apnea 
was 
provided 
therefore 
there 
is 
a 
substantial 
possibility 
that 
the 
association 
presented 
is 
spurious 
or 
secondary 
to 
multiple 
testing. 
Moreover, 
the 
study 
was 
biased 
by 
the 
evidence 
that 
HLA-A2 
positive

had 
a 
greater 
BMI 
than 
those 
HLA-A2 
negative 
and, 
therefore, 
the 
increased 
incidence 
of 
OSAS 
in 
this 
subgroup 
of 
patients 
could 
have 
been 
related 
to 
obesity 
rather 
than 
to 
the 
influence 
of 
a 
particular 
HLA 
antigen. 


We 
have 
found 
no 
convincing 
evidence 
that 
HLA 
may 
be 
involved 
in 
the 
pathogenesis 
of 
SDB 
or 
OSAS 
although 
HLAB65 
was 
significantly 
more 
frequent 
in 
patients 
as 
compared 
with 
controls. 
This 
association 
could 
indicate 
one 
of 
several 
underlying 
biological 
phenomena. 
The 
first 
is 
that 
this 
antigen 
itself 
may 
be 
responsible 
for 
conferring 
susceptibility 
to 
disease 
however, 
the 
lack 
of 
any 
pathophysiologic 
mechanism 
by 
which 
HLA-B65 
may 
cause 
or 
predispose 
to 
SDB 
suggests 
to 
consider 
it 
a 
spurious 
association. 
An 
alternative 
explanation 
could 
be 
that 
there 
is 
a 
disease 
locus 
which 
is 
within 
the 
HLA 
region 
of 
the 
chromosome 
but 
is 
not 
itself 
part 
of 
the 
HLA 
system. 
In 
this 
case, 
there 
would 
be 
a 
linkage 
disequilibrium.

and 
the 
HLA 
antigen 
and 
as 
a 
result, 
a 
disproportionate 
percentage 
of 
patients 
bear 
this 
haplotype 
that 
has 
no 
role 
in 
the 
pathogenesis. 
We 
have 
hypothesized 
that 
HLA 
polymorphism 
may 
affect 
the 
risk 
of 
childhood 
upper 
respiratory 
infections 
thereby 
affecting 
tonsillar 
hypertrophy 
and 
so 
OSAS 
risk, 
however 
we 
have 
found 
no 
difference 
in 
the 
HLA-B65 
antigen 
frequencies 
of 
children 
with 
and 
without 
tonsillar 
hypertrophy. 
Finally 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
the 
higher 
prevalence 
of 
HLA-B65 
in 
patients 
than 
in 
controls 
is 
because 
of 
chance 
related 
to 
the 
small 
sample 
size. 


We 
are 
aware 
that 
the 
use 
of 
a 
clinic-based 
case 
sampling 
leads 
to 
questions 
of 
selection 
bias 
based 
on 
referral 
to 
the 
sleep 
clinic; 
indeed, 
socioeconomic 
factors 
or 
susceptibility 
to 
sleepiness 
may 
impact 
referral 
to 
sleep 
clinic 
and 
therefore 
invalidate 
the 
reported 
findings. 
However, 
the 
inclusion 
of 
all 
the 
consecutive 
children 
seen 
in 
our 
sleep 
clinic 
in 
a 
3-year 
period 
and 
the 
separate 
analysis 
between 
children 
with 
OSAS 
and 
primary 
snoring 
might 
have 
reduced 
the 
bias 
of 
referral. 
Finally, 
to 
reduce 
the 
influence 
of 
possible 
confounding 
factors 
we 
have 
excluded 
from 
the 
analysis 
obese 
and/or 
children 
with 
diseases 
known 
to 
be 
associated 
with 
OSAS 
(Chay 
et 
al., 
2000; 
Hoeve 
et 
al., 
2003; 
Redline 
et 
al., 
1999). 


The 
main 
limitation 
of 
our 
study 
is 
the 
small 
sample 
size 
of 
our 
series 
that 
reduces 
the 
power 
of 
the 
study 
and 
is 
responsible 
of 
the 
wide 
confidence 
intervals 
in 
the 
estimate 
of 
differences 
in 
antigens 
frequencies 
and 
odds 
ratios. 
However, 
our 
series 
of 
41 
consecutive, 
prospectively 
enrolled 
children 
with 
OSAS, 
represent 
a 
large 
group 
of 
patients 
that, 
according 
to 
the 
prevalence 
of 
OSAS 
in 
Southern 
Italy 
of 
about 
1% 
(95% 
CI 
0.8–1.2) 
(Brunetti 
et 
al., 
2001), 
reflects 
more 
than 
5500 
children 
screened. 
Moreover, 
this 
is 
the 
first 
systematic 
attempt 
to 
study 
HLA 
in 
children 
with 
OSAS 
that 
comes 
from 
a 
region 
where 
HLA 
antigens 
frequencies 
are 
well 
established 
(Borelli 
et 
al., 
1998) 
and 
has 
to 
be 
considered 
a 
preliminary 
report 
that 
can 
be 
a 
guide 
in 
addressing 
which 
HLA 
antigens 
shall 
be 
more 
deeply 
studied 
by 
other 
investigators 
without 
being 
penalized 
by 
the 
Bonferroni’s 
correction. 


Human 
leukocyte 
antigen 
is 
an 
objective 
genetic 
marker 
which 
has 
been 
used 
for 
the 
investigation 
of 
the 
genetic 
and 
familial 
factors 
in 
various 
diseases 
(Lechler 
and 
Warrens, 


2000) 
however, 
in 
a 
disease 
such 
OSAS 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
the 
inheritance 
of 
predisposition 
does 
not 
rely 
on 
a 
dominant 
genetic 
model. 
We 
believe 
that 
assessing 
the 
role 
of 
HLA 
in 
OSAS 
relies 
on 
an 
international 
effort 
to 
gather 
a 
large 
group 
of 
affected 
patients 
in 
order 
to 
enroll 
explore 
alternative 
genetic 
inheritance 
models.
