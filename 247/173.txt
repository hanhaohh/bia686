Hypothesis: 
Adenotonsillectomy 
improves 
general 
and 
disease-specific 
quality 
of

for 
properly 
selected 
patients 
suffering 
for 
upper

secondary 
to 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy 
(UAO) 
and 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
(OSA). 
Study 
Design: 
Prospective, 
nonrandomized 
questionnaire. 
Specific 
Aims: 
To 
evaluate 
quality 
of 
life 
in 
patients 
with 
UAO 
and 
OSA 
using 
general 
quality

instruments 
as 
well 
as 
disease-specific 
instruments. 
The 
results 
will 
be 
compared 
both 
pre-and 
postoperatively. 
Methods: 
Fifty-five 
patients 
aged 
2 
to 
16 
with 
the 
clinical 
diagnosis 
of 
UAO 
or 
OSA 
were 
recruited. 
The 
caregivers 
completed 
Children’s 
Health 
Questionnaire 
Parent 
Form-28 
(CHQPF-28) 
and 
OSA-18 
quality 
of 
life 
measures 
both 
pre-and 
postoperatively 
in 
the 
long 
and 
short 
term. 
Statistical 
analysis 
was 
performed 
using 
the 
unpaired 
Student 
t 
test, 
P 
value 
less 
than 
.05, 
and 
Spearman 
Rank 
coefficient. 
Results: 
CHQ-PF28 
scores 
were 
improved 
in 
the 
Physical 
Summary 
parameter 
in 
long-term 
follow-up. 
Psychosocial 
scores 
did 
not 
improve 
significantly. 
OSA-18 
scores 
showed 
improvement 
in 
both 
the 
short-and 
long-term 
scores. 
Physical 
findings 
and 
symptoms 
did 
not 
impact 
scores 
in 
any 
domain. 
Conclusions: 
Quality 
of 
life 
in 
children 
with 
OSA 
does 
improve 
after 
adenotonsillectomy. 
Disease-specific 
clinometric 
instruments 
show 
improvement 
in 
domains 
affected 
by 
the 
disease 
process. 
However, 
instruments 
used 
to 
assess 
general 
quality 
of 
life 
may 
show 
physical 
improvement 
but 
not 
psychosocial.

INTRODUCTION 


OSA 
and 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
(SDB) 
have 
been 
well 
described 
in 
the 
literature. 
It 
affects 
both 
adults 
and 
children. 
The 
syndromes 
are 
similar 
in 
many 
ways; 
however, 
they 
differ 
in 
major 
areas. 
The 
primary 
complaint 
is 
often 
snoring.1–4 
Other 
more 
serious 
problems 
include 
hypertension,5 
cor 
pulmonale,6 
and 
cardiovascular 
disease.
7 
In 
adults, 
its 
impact 
reaches 
deep 
within 
society, 
with 
consequences 
such 
as 
decreased 
job 
performance 
and 
falling 
asleep 
while 
driving. 
In 
children, 
it 
impacts 
school 
performance,8–11 
maxillofacial 
development, 
and 
the 
need 
for 
future 
orthodontics.12,13 


Today’s 
medicolegal 
climate 
is 
suggesting 
and 
often 
demanding 
documentation 
of 
OSA 
in 
adults 
by 
polysomnography 
(PSG) 
before 
third-party 
reimbursement 
for 
surgical 
treatment.14 
If 
a 
patient 
snores 
and 
does 
not 
have 
OSA, 
surgeries 
such 
as 
laser-assisted 
uvulopalatoplasty

are 
considered 
nonessential. 
Third-party 
reimbursement 
is 
not 
available. 


To 
date, 
documentation 
is 
seldom 
required 
before 
pediatric 
adenotonsillectomy. 
In 
children 
with 
obstructive 
airway 
symptoms 
and 
large 
tonsils, 
this 
is 
a 
common 
procedure. 
Adenotonsillectomy 
has 
been 
used 
since 
200 
AD. 
The 
two 
procedures 
have 
been 
used 
to 
treat 
a 
variety 
of 
ailments 
including 
failure 
to 
thrive, 
enuresis, 
anorexia, 
mental 
retardation, 
and 
systemic 
disease. 


Several 
tools 
are 
available 
for 
the 
definitive 
diagnosis 
of 
OSA.15–19 
PSG 
is 
the 
gold 
standard 
but 
is 
time 
consuming 
and 
expensive. 
PSG 
often 
has 
to 
be 
performed 
in 
tertiary 
care 
centers, 
with 
few 
clinicians 
capable 
of 
interpreting 
the 
results. 


The 
field 
of 
otolaryngology 
is 
in 
the 
forefront 
in 
developing 
clinometric 
tools 
to 
evaluate 
its 
procedures. 
Recent 
quality 
of 
life 
studies 
demonstrate 
short-term 
improvement 
in 
quality 
of 
life 
after 
adenotonsillectomy. 
This 
study 
was 
undertaken 
to 
determine 
whether 
the 
quality 
of 
life 
improves 
in 
children 
with 
UAO/OSA 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
in 
both 
long-term 
and 
short-term 
follow-up. 


EXPERIMENTAL 
DESIGN 
AND 
METHODS 


Sixty 
patients 
between 
the 
ages 
of 
0 
to 
15 
years 
seen 
in 
the 
Pediatric 
Otolaryngology 
Clinic 
were 
included 
in 
the 
study. 
Patients 
were 
recruited 
from 
July 
1998 
through 
July 
1999. 
Patients 
were 
sequentially 
referred 
from 
pediatricians’ 
offices 
with 
the 
suspicion 
of 
adenotonsillar 
enlargement 
and 
upper 
airway 
obstruction. 
Inclusion 
criteria 
were 
any 
patient, 
regardless 
of 
age, 
sex, 
race, 
or 
underlying 
medical 
factors, 
who 
clinically 
were 
diagnosed 
with 
obstructive 
OSA 
or 
UAO. 
To 
obtain 
the 
diagnosis 
of 
upper 
airway 
obstruction, 
patients 
had 
to 
have 
1) 
a 
history 
of 
loud 
snoring 
noted 
by 
primary 
caregiver, 
with 
audio 
tape 
when 
reliability 
is 
questioned 
and 
2) 
tonsillar 
size 
of 
!3 
or 
greater 
(filling 
50% 
of 
the 
oropharynx). 
Patients 
who 
have 
had 
a 
1) 
witnessed 
apnea 
and 
2) 
tonsillar 
size 
of 
!3 
or 
greater 
were 
diagnosed 
with 
OSA. 
Adenoid 
size 
was 
documented 
intraoperatively 
using 
a 
scale 
of 
0 
to 
4, 
with 
0 
representing 
absent 
adenoids, 
2 
being 
nonobstructive, 
3 
being 
partially 
obstructive, 
and 
4 
being 
completely 
obstructing 
the 
choanae. 
Exclusion 
criteria 
were 
tonsillectomy 
done 
for 
any 
reason 
other 
than 
UAO 
or 
OSA. 


Complete 
head 
and 
neck 
examination 
was 
performed. 
A 
data 
sheet 
was 
completed 
by 
the 
attending 
physician. 
Associated 
symptoms 
and 
comorbidities 
were 
documented. 
Because 
this 
is 
a 
tertiary 
referral 
center, 
many 
of 
the 
patients 
had 
comorbidities. 
These 
included 
reactive 
airway 
disease, 
obesity, 
developmental 
delay, 
asthma, 
impaired 
swallow, 
laryngomalacia, 
and 
failure 
to 
thrive. 
On 
the 
basis 
of 
a 
review 
of 
the 
last 
100 
cases, 
approximately 
10% 
of 
recruited 
patients 
were 
expected 
to 
have 
comorbidities. 
These 
findings 
may 
have 
a 
significant 
effect 
on 
quality 
of 
life, 
and 
the 
results 
were 
carefully 
considered 
when 
evaluating 
scores 
of 
the 
instruments. 


After 
obtaining 
proper 
consent, 
caregivers 
completed 
CHQPF-28. 
This 
form 
evaluates 
12 
subsets 
of 
function 
including 
family 
cohesion, 
family 
activities, 
parental 
impact, 
general 
health 
perceptions, 
self-esteem, 
mental 
health, 
behavior, 
bodily 
pain, 
social 
limitations 
caused 
by 
physical 
problems, 
and 
social 
limitations 
caused 
by 
emotional 
problems. 
The 
pediatric 
OSA-18 
is 
an 
instrument 
that 
evaluates 
five 
subscales 
including 
sleep 
disturbance, 
physical 
symptoms, 
emotional 
distress, 
daytime 
problems, 
and 
caregiver 
concerns. 


Patients 
underwent 
routine 
adenotonsillectomy 
under 
general 
anesthesia. 
Tonsil 
and 
adenoid 
size 
were 
documented 
using 
the 
previously 
described 
scale. 
Patients 
with 
a 
history 
of 
apnea 


Laryngoscope 
113: 
October

were 
admitted 
for 
23-hour 
stays. 
Patients 
were 
discharged 
when 
they 
tolerated 
adequate 
oral 
intake 
and 
had 
adequate 
pain 
control. 


Patients 
were 
scheduled 
for 
routine 
postoperative 
visits 
at 
3 
to 
6 
weeks. 
At 
the 
visit, 
caregivers 
completed 
the 
OSA-18 
and 
the 
CHQPF-28. 
Patients 
who 
missed 
the 
initial 
follow-up 
were 
contacted 
by 
telephone, 
and 
a 
follow-up 
visit 
was 
rescheduled. 
Instruments 
were 
collected 
by 
the 
principle 
investigator, 
who 
reviewed 
them 
for 
completeness. 
They 
were 
then 
scored 
by 
members 
of 
the 
outcomes 
research 
section. 
Patients 
then 
completed 
the 
OSA-18 
and 
the 
CHQPF-28 
6 
months 
to 
1 
year 
after 
the 
procedure. 


Statistical 
Analysis: 
Sample 
Size 
Determination 


In 
calculating 
the 
sample 
size 
needed 
for 
the 
CHQPF-28, 
it 
was 
assumed 
that 
1) 
the 
study 
population 
would 
be 
similar 
to 
the 
one 
used 
by 
Stewart 
et 
al.20 
and, 
therefore, 
2) 
the 
mean 
scores 
for 
the 
study 
group 
will 
be 
similar 
to 
the 
reported 
scores 
in 
this 
population, 
3) 
the 
scores 
for 
healthy 
“control” 
population 
are 
those 
used 
by 
Stewart 
et 
al.20 
(referenced 
to 
Langraff, 
Abetz, 
and 
Ware, 
Child 
Health 
Questionnaire 
[CHQ]: 
A 
User’s 
Manual)21 
and, 
4) 
the 
variance 
(and 
therefore 
the 
SD) 
are 
identical 
for 
both 
the 
treatment 
and 
control 
groups. 
On 
the 
basis 
of 
these 
assumptions, 
the 
minimum 
sample 
size 
needed 
to 
detect 
a 
statistically 
significant 
difference 
at 
the 
P 
. 
.05 
level 
is 
55 
per 
group. 
Scores 
for 
the 
healthy 
population 
are 
published 
by 
Langraff 
et 
al.21 


Regarding 
the 
OSA-18, 
no 
published 
or 
pilot 
scores 
are 
available. 
The 
detectable 
effect 
size 
for 
a 
sample 
size 
of 
55, 
P 
. 
.05, 
and 
power 
. 
80% 
was 
calculated. 
Given 
that 
this 
is 
a 
Likert 
7 
point 
scale, 
the 
average 
score 
is 
assumed 
to 
be 
4. 
If 
the 
SD 
is 
2, 
the 
detectable 
effect 
size 
will 
be 
0.94 
points. 
If 
the 
SD 
is 
3, 
the 
detectable 
effect 
size 
will 
be 
1.41 
points 
to 
be 
able 
to 
detect 
a 
statistical 
significance. 


CHQPF-28 
scores 
from 
the 
pre-and 
postoperative 
groups 
were 
compared 
with 
published 
normal 
values 
using 
Student’s 
unpaired 
t 
test. 
A 
paired 
two-tailed 
Student 
t 
test 
was 
used 
to 
detect 
statistically 
significant 
changes 
after 
surgery 
for 
each 
of 
the 
outcomes 
measures. 
Spearman 
rank 
correlation 
coefficients 


(r) 
were 
used 
to 
examine 
how 
survey 
scores 
correlated 
with 
each 
other 
after 
adenotonsillectomy. 
OSA-18 
scores, 
pre-and 
postoperative, 
were 
scored 
in 
a 
similar 
fashion 
as 
previously 
described 
on 
sample 
size 
calculations. 
RESULTS 


Sixty 
patients 
were 
enrolled 
in 
the 
study. 
Fifty-seven 
patients 
completed 
the 
study 
at 
3-week 
follow-up. 
Thirty-
five 
patients 
completed 
the 
study 
at 
6-month 
follow-up 
(60% 
response 
rate). 
These 
were 
returned 
by 
mail 
and 
by 
telephone 
interview 
by 
a 
nurse 
practitioner. 
Ages 
ranged 
from 
1 
to 
16 
years 
old, 
with 
a 
mean 
of 
6 
years 
old. 
There 
were 
two 
patients 
aged 
2 
years 
old 
or 
less. 
There 
were 
26 
males 
and 
31 
females. 


Results 
of 
the 
symptom

are 
included 
in 
Table

The 
majority 
of 
patients 
responded 
yes 
to

(85%). 
There 
was 
a 
smaller 
percentage 
of

values 
were 
obtained 
from 
the 
preoperative 
period, 
short-term 
follow-up, 
and 
long-term

A 
paired 
two-tailed 
Student’s 
t 
test 
was 
used 
to 
detect 
statistically 
significant 
changes 
after 
surgery 
for 
each 
of 
the 
outcome 
measures. 
Spearman 
rank 
correlation

(r) 
were 
used 
to 
examine 
how 
survey 
scores 
correlated 
with 
each 
other 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
(Table 
III). 
OSA-18 
scores 
pre-and 
postoperative 
(short 
and 
long 
term) 
were 
scored 
in 
a 
similar 
fashion 
as 
previously 
described 
on 
sample 
size 
calculations 
(Table 
IV). 


CHQPF-28

were 
not 
statistically 
significant 
when 
comparing 
preoperative 
and 
short-term 
follow 
up 
in 
the 
Physical

Score 
(Table

although 
there 
was 
a 
downward 
trend. 
There 
was 
a 
further 
downward 
trend 
in 
long-term 
response, 
but 
these 
were 
not 
statistically 
significant 
(P

There 
was 
a 
significant 
difference 
from 
preoperative 
to 
long-term

The 
Psychosocial

did 
not 
show 
a 
statistically

when 
the 
three

DISCUSSION 


Pediatric 
OSA, 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
secondary 
to 
UAO, 
and 
other 
sleep 
disorders 
are 
very 
common 
diagnoses 
in 
the 
pediatric 
population. 
They 
affect 
up 
to 
11% 
of 
children,22 
affecting 
males 
and 
females 
equally. 
Patients 
with 
craniofacial 
disorders, 
sickle 
cell 
disease,23 
and 
obesity 
are 
at 
higher 
risk 
for 
these 
disorders. 
Patients 
typically 
present 
with 
an 
array 
of 
symptoms 
including 
loud 
snoring, 
mouth 
breathing, 
gasping, 
apnea, 
enuresis, 
daytime 
somnolence, 
and 
behavioral 
changes.24 
Several 
studies 
have 
demonstrated 
serious 
effects 
on 
behavior, 
with 
disruption 
of 
school 
performance 
and 
aggression.8–11 
Serious 
cardiovascular 
complications 
include 
cor 
pulmonale, 
cardiac 
arrhythmias, 
and 
hypertension. 


The 
most 
common 
physical 
findings 
in 
children 
with 
symptoms 
of 
UAO 
and 
OSA 
are 
enlargement 
of 
the 
adenoid 
and 
tonsils. 
Adenoidectomy 
and 
tonsillectomy 
have 
been 
the 
primary 
treatment 
for 
pediatric 
UAO 
and 
OSA. 


Craniofacial 
anomalies 
such 
as 
Nager 
syndrome, 
Treacher-Collins, 
and 
Down 
syndrome 
may 
have 
associated 
anomalies 
that 
may 
add 
other 
levels 
of 
obstruction. 
Children 
may 
also 
have 
orthodontic 
problems, 
associated 
with 
mouth 
breathing 
as 
a 
result 
of 
nasal 
and 
airway 
obstruction. 
These 
patients 
improve 
with 
adenotonsillectomy. 
However, 
they 
may 
require 
other 
procedures 
such 
as 
uvulopalatopharyngoplasty 
or 
midface 
advancements 
or 
distractions 
to 
resolve 
the 
obstruction. 


Because 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
and 
OSA 
are 
disease 
processes 
that 
are 
known 
to 
adversely 
affect 
the 
quality 
of 
life, 
it 
is 
important 
for 
clinicians 
to 
understand 
the 
short-term 
and 
long-term 
implications 
of 
the 
treatment 
as 
documented 
by 
the 
patients’ 
and 
caregivers’ 
perception 
of 
their 
quality 
of 
life. 
Adenotonsillectomy 
is 
an 
accepted 
treatment 
for 
most 
children 
suffering 
from 
OSA/ 
UAO. 
It 
remains 
one 
of 
the 
most 
commonly 
performed 
procedures 
in 
otolaryngology. 
In 
properly 
selected 
patients, 
it 
should 
alter 
the 
perception 
of 
the 
quality 
of 
life 
in 
this 
group 
and 
resolve 
the 
obstructive 
symptoms. 


Clinometric 
instruments, 
properly 
designed, 
can 
be 
powerful 
tools 
for 
evaluating 
the 
impact 
of 
medical 
problems 
on 
patients 
and 
their 
perception 
of 
quality 
of 
life. 
Although 
the 
precise 
definition 
of 
quality 
of 
life 
remains 
debatable, 
it 
is 
clear 
that 
the 
best 
information 
to 
measure 
such 
quality 
is 
obtained 
directly 
from 
the 
patient. 
The 
elements 
of 
a 
quality 
of 
life 
outcome 
monitor 
include 
both 
a 
general 
health 
assessment 
and 
a 
disease-specific 
instrument. 
Information 
from 
these 
assessments 
is 
often 
useful 
for 
third-party 
payers. 


Stewart20 
recently 
reported 
changes 
in 
quality 
of 
life 
in 
patients 
undergoing 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
both 
OSA 
and 
recurrent 
tonsillitis. 
Using 
a 
nonspecific 
instrument, 
CHQPF-28 
as 
well 
as 
the 
adult 
OSA 
instrument, 
they 
concluded 
that 
adenotonsillectomy 
does 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
life 
in 
properly 
selected 
patients. 


The 
CHQPF-28 
is 
a 
previously 
validated 
clinometric 
instrument 
used 
for 
caregiver 
evaluation 
of 
a 
child’s 
general 
health. 
The 
pediatric 
OSA-18 
is 
an 
instrument 
developed 
and 
recently 
validated 
by 
Rosenfeld 
et 
al.25 
This 
instrument 
specifically 
assesses 
the 
quality 
of 
life 
in 
pediatric 
patients 
undergoing 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
upper 
airway 
obstruction.

social 
domains 
include 
family 
activities, 
parent 
time, 
self-
esteem, 
and 
general 
health. 
In 
fact, 
initial 
scores 
decreased. 
This 
may 
be 
related 
to 
the 
timing, 
with 
samples 
being 
too 
close 
to 
the 
immediate 
postoperative 
visit. 
The 
CHQPF-28 
evaluates 
domains 
that 
reflect 
the 
general 
pediatric 
population. 
Previously, 
CHQPF-28 
scores 
in 
OSA 
were 
found 
to 
be 
similar 
to 
scores 
in 
pediatric 
patients 
with 
juvenile 
arthritis. 
These 
domains 
may 
not 
play 
a 
significant 
role 
in 
children 
with 
upper 
airway 
obstruction. 
This 
finding 
supports 
the 
development 
and 
implementation 
of 
disease-specific 
instruments. 
The 
Physical 
Summary 
Score 
did 
show 
a 
significant 
improvement 
in 
summary 
score. 
The 
domains 
in 
this 
assessment 
may 
more 
accurately 
assess 
the 
areas 
where 
obstructive 
breathing 
patterns 
play 
a 
role. 
Also, 
significant 
psychosocial 
parameters 
may 
be 
present 
but 
not 
related 
to 
the 
symptoms 
of 
upper 
airway 
obstruction. 


The 
OSA-18 
scores 
from 
this 
study 
showed 
improvement 
in 
scores 
in 
all 
domains 
in 
both 
the 
short-term 
and 
long-term 
periods. 
Domains 
of 
greatest 
improvement 
include 
physical 
concerns 
and 
daytime 
problems. 
Emotional 
disturbance 
had 
the 
least 
improvement. 
Factors 
related 
to 
emotional 
disturbance 
may 
take 
longer 
to 
develop 
than 
physical 
problems. 
This 
area 
may 
be 
further 
assessed 
in 
future 
studies. 


Multivariate 
analysis 
was 
used 
to 
determine 
whether 
any 
of 
the 
reported 
symptoms 
or 
physical 
findings 
were 
predictive 
of 
improvement 
in 
quality 
of 
life 
scores. 
There 
was 
no 
relationship. 
This 
suggests 
that 
no 
particular 
complaint 
identifies 
the 
degree 
of 
improvement 
in 
this 
group 
of 
patients.

after 
adenotonsillectomy. 
Although 
75% 
of 
patients 
were 
seen 
within 
3 
weeks 
of 
surgery, 
the 
remainder 
of 
patients 
were 
seen 
within 
a 
3-month 
period. 
Their 
analysis 
found 
that 
if 
the 
two 
groups 
were 
separated 
into 
long-
and 
short-term 
follow-up, 
the 
difference 
in 
quality 
of 
life 
in 
the 
long-term 
group 
was 
statistically 
significant. 
This 
present 
study 
found 
that 
even 
in 
the 
short-term 
follow 
up, 
scores 
were 
improved. 
The 
long-term 
group 
showed 
improvement 
also, 
however, 
not 
statistically 
improved 
from 
the 
short-term 
group. 
Similar 
to 
the 
study 
by 
de 
Serres, 
the 
sleep 
disturbance 
domain 
in 
this 
study 
showed 
the 
most 
significant 
improvement. 
Our 
study 
did 
not 
find 
a 
statistically 
significant 
difference 
between 
short-term 
and 
long-term 
follow-up. 
This 
suggests 
that 
patients 
obtain 
and 
sustain 
a 
long-term 
benefit 
shortly 
after 
the 
procedure. 


PSG 
was 
not 
used 
to 
document 
the 
presence 
of 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
or 
OSA 
in 
this 
study. 
To 
document 
the 
diagnosis 
of 
OSA 
and 
UAO, 
PSG 
is 
often 
used 
and 
is 
considered 
the 
gold 
standard 
for 
evaluation 
of 
these 
syndromes. 
PSG 
is 
performed 
on 
an 
inpatient 
basis 
at 
a 
pediatric 
institution. 
Some 
outpatient 
examinations 
are 
available; 
however, 
these 
studies 
may 
be 
more 
technically 
difficult 
in 
the 
young 
child. 
The 
overnight 
study 
provides 
information 
on 
oxygen 
saturation, 
apneas, 
and 
hypopneas. 
At 
our 
institution, 
the 
study 
covers 
standard 
parameters 
including 
electroencephalogram, 
electrocardiogram, 
end 
tidal 
CO2, 
esophageal 
pressures, 
chest 
and 
abdominal 
movement 
monitors, 
and 
oxygen 
saturations. 
Criteria 
at 


Laryngoscope 
113: 
October 
2003 


this 
institution 
for 
the 
diagnosis 
of 
OSA 
is 
greater 
than 
five 
episodes 
of 
apnea/hypopnea 
lasting 
6 
seconds 
or 
more. 
Previously 
reported 
studies28 
have 
used 
other 
criteria, 
including 
apnea 
as 
cessation 
of 
breath 
for 
more 
than 
2.5 
breaths 
with 
continued 
respiratory 
effort 
as 
well 
as 
respiratory 
distress 
index 
(RDI) 
of 
15 
or 
1 
hour 
with 
more 
than 
25 
events. 
Marcus 
et 
al.30 
examined 
50 
healthy 
children 
using 
PSG. 
They 
found 
that 
any 
obstructive 
event 
in 
a 
child 
was 
abnormal. 
Therefore, 
criteria 
for 
diagnosis 
OSA 
was 
an 
apnea/hypopnea 
index 
of 
1 
or 
more. 


Although 
felt 
to 
be 
the 
gold 
standard 
for 
diagnosis, 
PSG 
has 
several 
problems 
associated 
with 
the 
feasibility 
of 
these 
studies. 
First, 
the 
studies 
cost 
anywhere 
between 
$600 
to 
$2800 
at 
most 
institutions. 
Also, 
there 
is 
typically 
a 
long 
wait 
list. 
Because 
of 
the 
small 
number 
of 
practitioners 
capable 
of 
interpreting 
the 
studies, 
there 
is 
an 
associated 
delay 
in 
obtaining 
the 
result. 
Therefore, 
most 
otolaryngologists 
prefer 
to 
rely 
on 
clinical 
diagnosis, 
reserving 
the 
result 
of 
PSG 
for 
those 
patients 
with 
severe 
disease 
or 
with 
a 
questionable 
diagnosis. 
Other 
studies 
such 
as 
sleep 
sonography,31 
daytime 
nap 
studies, 
and 
overnight 
oximetry 
have 
been 
used 
in 
the 
evaluation 
of 
OSA. 
These 
studies 
do 
not 
provide 
adequate 
information 
of 
the 
respiratory 
changes 
that 
occur 
during 
nighttime 
sleep. 
Although 
cheaper 
and 
more 
feasible, 
they 
are 
less 
accurate. 


This 
study 
relied 
exclusively 
on 
clinical 
examination 
for 
the 
diagnosis 
of 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
and 
OSA. 
The 
accuracy 
of 
clinical 
examination 
has 
been 
questioned. 
However, 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
clinical 
diagnosis 
and 
treatment, 
quality 
of 
life 
did 
improve 
in 
individuals 
who 
underwent 
adenotonsillectomy. 
Therefore, 
these 
authors 
feel 
that 
PSG 
should 
be 
reserved 
for 
patients 
who 
are 
at 
high 
risk 
for 
surgical 
complications 
or 
for 
those 
where 
the 
diagnosis 
is 
in 
question. 
Nieminen 
et 
al.32 
studied 
a 
group 
of 
pediatric 
patients 
with 
clinical 
OSA, 
and 
less 
than 
half 
actually 
were 
documented 
by 
PSG. 
Although 
most 
physicians 
rely 
on 
their 
clinical 
examination 
for 
the 
diagnosis 
of 
OSA, 
studies 
have 
not 
proven 
the 
examination 
to 
be 
predictive. 
After 
obtaining 
symptoms 
suggestive 
of 
OSA, 
as 
well 
as 
clinical 
factors 
such 
as 
tonsil 
size, 
nasal 
flow, 
and 
weight, 
patients 
underwent 
polysomnograms. 
Multiple 
regression 
analysis 
did 
not 
reveal 
a 
significant 
relationship 
between 
clinical 
parameters 
and 
OSA 
diagnosed 
by 
PSG. 
Wang 
et 
al.33 
also 
did 
not 
find 
significant 
correlation 
of 
clinical 
examination 
and 
polysomnograms. 


Primary 
snoring 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
reported 
symptoms. 
However, 
it 
is 
often 
not 
associated 
with 
SDB. 
Marcus 
et 
al.34 
found 
that 
in 
a 
cohort 
of 
20 
patients 
with 
primary 
snoring, 
there 
was 
no 
progression 
to 
OSA 
over 
a 
period 
of 
several 
years. 
Topol 
et 
al.35 
reevaluated 
13 
children 
who 
previously 
had 
primary 
snoring 
by 
PSG. 
Only 
one 
child 
went 
on 
to 
OSA. 
Patients 
with 
primary 
snoring, 
when 
compared 
with 
nonsnoring 
controls, 
however, 
exhibited 
impaired 
attention 
and 
lowered 
memory 
and 
intelligence 
scores, 
suggesting 
that 
even 
mild 
SDB 
has 
a 
significant 
impact 
on 
functioning.36 


de 
Serres 
et 
al.27 
developed 
and 
used 
the 
OSD-6 
as 
a 
disease-specific 
instrument 
for 
pediatric 
patients 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
symptoms. 
OSA-18, 
the 
instrument 
used 
in 
this 
study, 
and 
OSD-6 
had 
similar 
improvement 
in 
quality

of 
life 
in 
children 
with 
SDB. 
The 
OSD-6 
is 
a 
brief, 
six-
question 
survey 
that 
asks 
the 
caregiver 
to 
assess 
effects 
of 
a 
group 
of 
complaints 
listed 
in 
a 
single 
domain. 
The 
OSA18, 
however, 
lists 
several 
complaints 
independently 
in 
six 
separate 
domains. 
Although 
both 
tools 
have 
been 
validated, 
the 
interpretation 
by 
caregivers 
may 
lead 
to 
a 
more 
difficult 
assessment. 
Although 
the 
OSA-18 
may 
provide 
the 
clinician 
with 
more 
details, 
the 
OSD-6 
may 
be 
more 
easily 
administered. 
Nevertheless, 
both 
tools 
did 
demonstrate 
improvement 
in 
quality 
of 
life 
scores. 


CONCLUSION 


Long-term 
quality 
of 
life 
improves 
in 
properly 
selected 
pediatric 
patients 
after 
adenotonsillectomy. 
Clinical 
examination 
appropriately 
selects 
patients 
with 
enlarged 
tonsil 
and 
symptoms 
of 
obstruction. 
Although 
PSG 
may 
provide 
information 
on 
children 
with 
OSA 
and 
UAO, 
it 
is 
not 
necessary 
to 
determine 
which 
patients 
will 
have 
improved 
quality 
of 
life 
in 
patients 
after 
adenotonsillectomy.
