Background: Obesity is thought to be a significant risk factor for upper 
airway obstruction during sleep in children. However, the moderating 
influences of age and ethnicity have not been well explored and 
the relative contribution of obesity per se to upper airway obstruction 
has yet to be quantified. Given the markedly increasing prevalence of 
childhood obesity, an objective understanding of the impact of obesity 
on upper airway obstruction is important. The purpose of the present 
study was to examine the interaction between obesity, age and upper 
airway obstruction in Australian Caucasian children referred for evaluation 
of snoring.

Methods: This was a retrospective case study involving 190 children 
(4-12 y) who were referred for evaluation of upper airway obstruction 
and underwent one night of polysomnography at the Adelaide 
Women’s and Children’s Hospital Sleep Disorders Unit. Children were 
classified as Infrequent Snorers (n = 80), Habitual Snorers (n = 68) or 
Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) (n = 42) (i.e., obstructive 
apnea hypopnea index (OAHI) = 1).

Results: Thirty-five percent (66/190) of children were overweight or 
obese. Body mass index but not age was a significant but weak predictor 
of OAHI (< 5% of the variance).

Conclusion: In Australian Caucasian children aged 4-12 years who 
snore, obesity but not age was a significant, albeit weak, predictor of 
upper airway obstruction during sleep.

Childhood obesity is now recognized as a major pediatric 
health issue.1 Over the past decade the prevalence of obesity 
in children has increased two- to threefold in the UK,2 fourfold 
in USA and four- to sixfold in Australia.3 It is associated with 
a range of known significant health and social problems (e.g., 
diabetes, hypertension, peer rejection)4 and there is emerging 
evidence that childhood obesity may also be an important risk 
factor for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS).5 Moreover, 
the inflammatory effects of both obesity and upper airway 
obstruction may be additive.6 However, the relationship 
between childhood obesity and OSAS may be more complex 
than previously thought.

In children the physiological effects of obesity on the respiratory 
system are believed to be similar to that of adults with 
an increased mass effect on the upper airway, deposition of fat 
in the pharyngeal muscles, decreased chest wall compliance, 
cephalad displacement of the diaphragm and blunting of central 
respiratory drive all increasing the potential severity of OSAS.7 
The rise in childhood obesity is therefore likely to predispose 
increasing numbers of children to OSAS.

Obesity in children may also be a risk factor for other sleep 
breathing disorders. Verhulst et al.8 recently reported the intriguing 
finding that abdominal obesity was associated with central 
apnea (but not OSAS) in 91 overweight and obese children referred 
for evaluation of snoring. This work awaits further exploration.


Ethnicity is a recognized modulator of OSAS in children. For 
example, African American compared to Caucasian children are 
reported to be at greater risk of OSAS,5,9,10 and while not directly 
compared with other groups, Asian children are thought to be at 
lower risk.11 However, the detailed interaction, between ethnicity, 
obesity and OSAS has not been well explored. A summary of 
the literature exploring ethnicity and OSAS frequency in children 
is given in Appendix 1. In general, the studies have not specifically 
evaluated the relative contribution of ethnicity with most 
recruiting mixed ethnic samples. Inspection of the findings from 
studies which have largely sampled a single ethnic group would 
suggest that there is a modest association between obesity and 
OSAS in samples containing predominantly African American 
children,12,13 mixed findings in Asian children with one group 
reporting no association (Chinese)14 and two groups (both Chinese) 
a weak association15,16 and little association in Caucasian 
children.17,18 Given this background, the relative contribution of

ethnicity remains to be more fully examined especially in Caucasian 
children where there is a paucity of data.

Age may also be an important factor modulating the impact 
of obesity on OSAS in children with an emerging consensus 
that the association may be stronger in older children.19 Our 
review of the literature suggests that an association between 
obesity and OSAS is more often reported in older than younger 
children (Appendix 1). In the only study to date that has specifically 
examined the relationship between OSAS and obesity in 
different age groups, Stepanski et al20 report that obesity was 
more frequent in older (8-12 years) compared to younger (< 8 
years) children with OSAS.

Considering the findings of age and ethnicity in the genesis 
of OSAS in children an important question is once these factors 
have been controlled, what is the relative contribution of 
obesity to OSAS? The aim of the present study was to examine 
the interaction between obesity, age and upper airway obstruction 
in Australian Caucasian children referred for evaluation of 
snoring.

METHODS

Participants

This was retrospective case study. Consecutive healthy children 
aged 4 to 12 years who were referred for evaluation of 
snoring and possible OSAS to the Sleep Disorders Unit, Women’s 
and Children Hospital, Adelaide, South Australia over the 
period October 1999 to December 2003 were included as participants 
in the present study. We excluded non-Caucasian children, 
children with specific syndromes (e.g., midface hypoplasia, 
Prader-Willi Syndrome), children prescribed psychotropic 
medication and children with a significant medical condition 
that could potentially result in hypoxemia and/or sleep fragmentation 
(e.g., uncontrolled asthma, cystic fibrous). A final 
total of 190 Caucasian children were selected, of which 55% 
were referred from respiratory medicine, 22% otorhinolaryngology, 
and 23% general pediatric clinics. The children were 
classified by polysomnography (PSG) and parental responses 
to the question “Does your child snore”? into three groups reflecting 
increasing severity: Intermittent Snorers (IS; normal 
PSG [OAHI < 1] and snoring < 3 nights per week, n = 80), 
Habitual Snorers (HS; normal PSG [OAHI < 1] and snoring 
= 3 or more nights per week, n = 68) and Obstructive Sleep apnea 
Syndrome (OSAS; obstructive apnea and hypopnea index 
[OAHI = 1], n = 42).

Established growth charts corrected for age and gender were 
used to determine body mass index (BMI) z-scores and classify 
overweight and obesity (BMI = 85th and 95th percentile respectively.
21

Because of previous evidence of an association between 
childhood OSAS and parental snoring,22 smoking in the home22 
and socioeconomic status (SES) 23 these variables were also collected 
and covaried for in the analyses. Frequent snoring by 
either parent and smoking of cigarettes by any member of a 
household was determined by parental report. A measure of 
socioeconomic status (SES) was derived from the Australian 
Bureau of Statistics’ Index of Relative Socio-economic Advantage/
Disadvantage 2001 national census data (Australian Bureau 
of Statistics, Canberra, 2001). A higher score on this index 
indicates increased income and occupational skills and/or training 
within the geographical area of residence.

This study was approved by the Human Ethics Committee 
Women’s and Children’s Hospital Adelaide.

Polysomnography

Overnight PSG was conducted without sedation or sleep 
deprivation and began at each child’s usual bedtime. A parent 
accompanied each child throughout the procedure. Polysomnography 
was performed using a computerized sleep data acquisition 
system (Compumedics S-Series Sleepwatch System, 
Melbourne, Australia). The following standard parameters were 
measured and recorded continuously utilizing the appropriate 
signal sampling and filtering protocols: electroencephalogram 
(EEG; C3-A2 or C4-A1), left and right electrooculogram 
(EOG), submental and intercostal electromyogram (EMG) with 
skin surface electrodes, leg movements by piezoelectric motion 
detection, heart rate by electrocardiogram (ECG), oronasal airflow 
by thermistor and nasal pressure, respiratory movements 
of the chest and abdominal wall using uncalibrated respiratory 
inductive plethysmography, arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) 
by pulse oximetry (Nellcor N2000) and transcutaneous CO2 
(TcCO2) using a heated (41oC) transcutaneous electrode (TINA, 
Radiometer Pacific). All data were digitized and stored on computer 
disk for subsequent analysis. Each child was continuously 
monitored and observed via infrared camera by a pediatric sleep 
technician who also documented observations of sleep behavior 
including the presence or absence of snoring.

Data Analysis

All polysomnograms were analyzed and scored manually by 
a sleep technician experienced and trained in analyzing pediatric 
sleep studies. The interscorer concordance (kappa) between 
two sleep technicians who randomly sampled a set of PSG used 
in this study was > 0.9. Sleep stages were scored in 30-sec epochs 
according to the standardized EEG, EOG, and EMG criteria.
24 Movement time was scored as a separate category and was 
not included in either sleep or awake time. Epochs were scored 
as movement if the EEG and EOG signals were obscured for 
> 50% of the epoch by muscle tension or artifact associated 
with movement of the subject.24 Awake time refers to time spent 
awake during the recording period after initial sleep onset.

Respiratory variables were scored according to standard 
guidelines recommended for pediatric sleep studies.25 Obstructive 
apneas were defined as the absence of airflow associated 
with continued chest and abdominal wall movement for duration 
of two or more respiratory cycles. Obstructive hypopneas 
were defined as a 50% to 80% reduction in the amplitude of 
the RIP and/or airflow signal associated with paradoxical chest/
abdominal wall movement for duration of two or more respiratory 
cycles and associated with = 3% oxygen desaturation. 
The presence of any other supportive data such as increased 
intercostal or submental EMG activity was also used to distinguish 
between obstructive and central hypopneas. The obstructive 
apnea and hypopnea index (OAHI) was calculated as the

divided by the total sleep time and expressed as the number of 
events per hour of sleep. An OAHI > 1 was considered indicative 
of OSAS.

Spontaneous and respiratory arousals were scored according 
to the criteria of the American Sleep Disorders Task Force and 
are expressed as the total number of arousals per hour of sleep 
(spontaneous arousal index and respiratory arousal index).25

Central apneas were scored when there was an absence 
of respiratory effort to < 20% of baseline for = 2 respiratory 
cycles in association with an absence of airflow and, as well, 
an absence of thoracoabdominal effort and reliable diaphragmatic 
EMG activity in the presence of = 3% oxygen desaturation. 
The central apnea index (CAI) was calculated as the total 
number of central apneas divided by the total sleep time and 
expressed as the number of events per hour of sleep.

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 14.0 
for Windows (Chicago, IL). All p values reported are 2-tailed, 
with statistical significance determined at a = 0.05. Data are 
presented as mean (95% CI) unless otherwise stated.

The severity of upper airway obstruction was entered as an 
independent variable (i.e., IS, HS, and OSAS) into a series of 
Chi-square analyses to explore group differences in categorical 
variables (gender, parental snoring, and smoking in the home). 
One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for 
group differences in the continuous variables, i.e., age, socioeconomic 
status, BMI z-score, and sleep variables. Games-
Howell tests were used in post hoc analyses.

Apart from two exceptions all variables were normally distributed. 
The two exceptions were OAHI and CAI, which displayed 
significant positive skew and were, therefore, inversely 
transformed before entering into analyses [i.e. 1/(x+c), where 
x = data value and c = 1].26 The transformed values are indicated 
as OAHI-transformed and CAI-transformed. Please note 
that lower transformed scores indicate more severe disease.

The relationship between Age and BMI z-score with demographic 
and sleep variables were explored using Pearson-r or 
in the case of ordinal data Spearman-rho correlational analyses 
and significance was tested using Fishers r-z transformations. 
Hierarchical regressions were used to explore the variance explained 
by age (step 1) and BMI z-score (step 2) in OAHI and, 
likewise, age (step 1) and BMI z-score (step 2) in CAI.

RESULTS

Heavier children were more likely to have OSAS. The percentage 
of overweight/obese was higher in OSAS (52% [22/42]) 
than either IS (30% [24/80]) or HS (29% [20/68]) children. Conversely, 
OSAS was more frequent in overweight/obese (22/66 
[33%]) than normal weight (20/124 [16%]) children.

ANOVA revealed that OSAS children had a significantly 
higher BMI z-score than either IS or HS children (post hoc 
analysis: OSAS > IS = HS, p < 0.05) (Table 1). As expected, 
Respiratory Arousal Index scores were significantly higher 
(OSAS > IS = HS, p < 0.05) while OAHI-transformed (i.e. inverse 
OAHI) and SpO2 nadir scores were significantly lower 
in OSAS than IS and HS children (both OSAS < IS = HS, 
p < 0.05). CAI-transformed (i.e. inverse CAI) scores were also

lower in OSAS than either IS and HS children (OSAS < IS = 
HS, p < 0.05). No significant group differences were observed 
in the remaining demographic or sleep variables.

Correlational analysis indicated that children with a higher 
BMI z-score demonstrated a significantly higher number of obstructive 
and central respiratory events during sleep, increased 
frequency of respiratory arousals and lower SpO2 nadir (Table 
2). As well, older age was associated with fewer central apneas.


To investigate the possible interaction between age with obesity 
and SDB, we divided the sample according to the criteria 
used by Stepanski et al (1999) into young (< 8 y) and old (= 8 y) 
children. Restricting our examination to children with obesity 
(n = 51), OSAS was more frequent in younger children (47% 
[14/30]) than older children (24% [5/21]). However, despite 
this trend the distribution of SDB subtypes was not significantly 
different between young and old children (chi-square = 2.9, 
p > 0.05).

As can be seen in Table 1, the Parental Snoring, Smoking 
in the Home and SES scores were comparable across the three 
SDB groups. Examination of the relationship between these 
variables and OAHI and, likewise, CAI revealed no significant 
correlations (all p > 0.05). A history of parental snoring, exposure 
to smoking in the home or lower SES were not associated 
with increased OAHI and CAI.

The regression results are summarized in Table 3. BMI 
z-score was predictive of upper airway obstruction. However, 
while significant, BMI z-score contributed only 4.5% of explained 
variance in OAHI-transformed. Age and BMI z-score 
were significant predictors of central apnea, but again only contributed 
a small percentage of the variance in CAI-transformed, 
3.7% and 3.8% respectively.

DISCUSSION

In a large clinical sample of Australian Caucasian children 
undergoing overnight PSG for the assessment of snoring, those 
with confirmed OSAS had a greater body mass index than children 
with either intermittent or habitual snoring. Regression 
analyses revealed that increased body mass index was predictive 
of upper airway obstruction. However, the association was 
weak, with body mass index explaining less than 5% of the 
variance in obstructive apnea hypopnea index. This is comparable 
to findings reported by de la Eva et al17 and Goodwin et 
al18 in samples consisting mainly of Caucasian children. In the 
present study, increased body mass index together with younger 
age were also predictive of central apnea. Again however, the 
association was weak with age and body mass index together 
explaining less than 8% of the variance in central apnea index. 
Overall, the present findings suggest that obesity is a weak 
predictor of upper airway obstruction in Australian Caucasian 
children.

Recent reports suggest that older obese children are at higher 
risk for OSAS.19 This is supported by inspection of the studies 
summarized in Appendix 1 where the relationship between obesity 
and OSAS is more frequently reported in studies performed 
in older compared to younger children. In contradistinction to 
these findings, age in the present study was not predictive of 
upper airway obstruction. The current literature examining the 
relationship between age, childhood obesity and upper airway 
obstruction is limited by several methodological shortcomings. 
These include small subject numbers a failure to normalize obesity 
for age and gender, lack of quantification of upper airway 
severity by full overnight polysomnography, lack of a comparison 
or control group and, in particular, a lack of control for 
ethnicity.5,14,20,27-29

In the present study we restricted our sample to Australian 
Caucasian children because they form the majority of the population 
seen in our sleep laboratory. Studies reporting an association 
between obesity and OSAS have included a relatively high 
percentage of African American and/or Asian children. Independent 
of obesity, African American children appear to be at 
higher risk of OSAS.5,9,10 The relationship between obesity and 
OSAS is less well documented in Asian children, but Lam et 
al.15 report a weak association in a sample of 480 Chinese children 
(r = 0.16). Unfortunately, to date, the interaction between 
obesity, ethnicity and OSAS has not been well explored and

while the percentage of obese children with OSAS is sometimes 
reported the percentage further divided by ethnicity is not 
(Appendix 1). Taken together, we suggest that ethnicity may 
be a more important modulator of increased risk of upper airway 
obstruction in obese children than has been previously assumed.


Like Verhulst and colleagues,8 we found that body mass index 
was predictive of central apnea. In addition, we found that 
younger age was predictive of increased CAI severity. Nonetheless 
some caution is needed in the interpretation of these findings. 
Chest and abdominal movement recordings during PSG 
are particularly prone to artifact amongst obese patients. When 
increased abdominal adiposity is present and muscle function 
and respiratory drive are impaired, such as during REM, the 
ability to move the chest wall in response to an obstructed upper 
airway may be impaired.30 Consequently, obstructive respiratory 
events may be erroneously scored as central events thereby 
underscoring the degree of obstruction.

A limitation of the present study is that we studied children 
referred to a sleep unit at a children’s hospital. It is conceivable 
that obesity might be a differential factor for referral and this 
tendency would have increased the likelihood of overweight/
obese children with suspected OSAS in our sample. We therefore 
reasoned that this would result in an increased likelihood 
of finding a relationship between obesity and OSAS. Thirty-
five percent of our sample was overweight or obese. This is 
comparable to values reported elsewhere in a U.S. clinic sample.
6 In our “biased” sleep laboratory sample, we would have 
expected a higher prevalence of obese children with OSAS than 
was observed. Given this positive bias, the finding of only a 
weak relationship between childhood obesity and upper airway 
obstruction in our present study is therefore instructive. 
Nonetheless, because children referred to a sleep clinic may be 
dissimilar to the general population of children the present findings 
may not be applicable to the general pediatric community. 
A further limitation of the present study is that the contribution 
of regional adiposity was not evaluated. In adults with OSAS 
excess parapharyngeal fat is associated with OSAS severity 31 
and whether the same applies to children is unclear. Finally, 
tonsillar size was not evaluated in the present study. Brooks et 
al13 report a significant correlation between adenoidal-nasopharyngeal 
ratio and apnea duration while Lam et al15 report a significant 
relationship between tonsillar size and OSAS severity. 
However, the relationship of tonsillar size to upper airway caliber 
during sleep may be the critical predictor of OSAS severity 
rather than tonsillar size per se.32

Socioeconomic status, parental snoring and smoking at 
home are reported to be associated with OSAS.22,23 In the present 
study the mean and/or frequency of these factors were comparable 
across the three upper airway obstruction groups. In 
addition, lower socioeconomic status, a history parental snoring 
and smoking at home were not associated with increased 
disease severity. A similar pattern of results were observed for 
central apnea.

Recent studies have established that children who demonstrate 
UAO have increased upper airway collapsibility,33 decreased 
upper airway volume,32 but successful neuromuscular 
compensatory mechanisms which maintain airway patency during 
wakefulness and NREM sleep.34 However, during obstructive 
events and REM sleep, upper airway tone is temporarily 
and dramatically reduced.35 Further, developmental changes 
in upper airway tone may also play a significant role in upper 
airway obstruction as upper airway tone is reported to decrease 
with age.36,37 No independent relationship between age 
and OSAS was demonstrated in the present study. The majority 
of studies reporting obesity to increase the risk of OSAS 
have recruited study participants with a mean age greater than 
10 years.12,16,38,40,41 Stepanski and colleagues20 have shown that 
children displaying upper airway obstruction had significantly 
greater BMI than children with no symptoms only when older 
than 8 years. Rosen10 in a sample of children with a mean age = 
5.8 years, while finding an increased proportion of obese children 
amongst referrals to a sleep clinic, did not report any association 
between obesity and OSAS. If an age point exists at 
which OSAS becomes a risk, as opposed to not, this has yet to 
be established. However, it is not unreasonable to suspect developmental 
factors play an important intermediary role in the 
development of upper airway obstruction.

In conclusion, we found in a homogenous group of Australian 
Caucasian children referred to a sleep disorders clinic for 
suspected upper airway obstruction that obesity was a significant 
but weak predictor of OSAS. Given the dramatic recent 
increase in the prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity 
and the emerging literature suggesting that adenotonsillectomy 
may not result in the same degree of resolution of obstruction 
as in normal weight children this area of research will continue 
to require detailed study.
