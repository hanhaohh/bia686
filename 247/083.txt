Introduction 
Obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
(OSA) 
is 
a 
common 
condition 
where 
during 
sleep, 
there 
are 
recurrent 
episodes 
of 
cessation 
of 
airflow 
despite 
persistent 
effort 
due 
to 
a 
mechanical 
obstruction 
anywhere 
from 
the 
nose 
to 
the 
vocal 
cords 
[1].

apnea 
lead 
to 
hypoxia 
and 
hypercapnia, 
which 
stimulates 
an 
increase 
in 
sympathetic 
output 
causing 
a 
rise 
in 
heart 
rate 
and 
blood 
pressure. 
This 
causes 
subcortical 
arousal 
which 
enables 
the 
individual 
to 
relieve 
the 
airway 
obstruction 
by 
changing 
their 
body 
position. 
OSA 
occurs 
in 
adults 
and 
children 
although 
the 
two 
groups 
usually 
have 
different 
etiologies. 
In 
children 
the 
vast 
majority 
of 
cases 
are 
due 
to 
adenoidal 
and 
tonsillar 
hypertrophy 
and 
as 
a 
consequence, 
the 
normal 
treatment 
for 
children 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
is 
adenotonsillectomy 
[2].

is 
known 
about 
why 
certain 
children 
develop 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy 
leading 
to 
sleep 
apnea. 
Known 
risk 
groups 
for 
OSA 
in 
children 
are 
symptoms 
of 
rhinosinusitis, 
obesity, 
African 
descent, 
a 
family 
history 
of 
OSA, 
and 
children 
with 
craniofacial 
abnormalities. 
In 
children 
OSA 
leads 
to 
a 
poor 
quality 
sleep 
and 
substantial 
associated 
morbidity 
for 
the 
affected 
patient 
[3]. 
Symptoms 
include 
snoring, 
restless 
sleep, 
excessive 
nocturnal 
sweating, 
bed 
wetting, 
increased 
total 
sleep, 
daytime 
sleepiness 
or 
more 
commonly 
hyperactivity, 
irritability, 
lack 
of 
concentration, 
a 
dry 
mouth 
and 
morning 
headaches. 
Signs 
include 
chronic 
mouth 
breathing, 
failure 
to 
thrive, 
broken 
facial 
capillaries 
due 
to 
chronic 
hypercapnia, 
pectus 
escavatum 
from 
longstanding 
intercostal 
recession 
during 
sleep, 
pulmonary 
hypertension 
and 
in 
extreme 
cases 
right 
heart 
failure. 


In 
this 
paper 
we 
set 
out 
to 
test 
our 
hypothesis 
that 
the 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy 
seen 
in 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
patients 
is 
related 
to 
upper 
airway 
allergy 
to 
airborne 
allergens 
by 
prospectively 
carrying 
out 
Radioallergosorbent 
(RAST) 
tests 
on 
pediatric 
patients 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea. 


2. 
Methods 
All 
children 
(<16 
years 
of 
age) 
under 
the 
care 
of 
the 
third 
author 
at 
a 
London 
teaching 
hospital 
who 
were 
undergoing 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA 
between 
January 
2003 
and 
April 
2004 
for 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
were 
considered 
for 
inclusion 
in 
the 
study. 
Patients 
with 
craniofacial 
abnormalities 
were 
excluded 
from 
the 
study. 
Obstructive 
sleep 
was 
diagnosed 
clinically 
with 
a 
symptom 
questionnaire 
and 
with 
a 
pre 
operative 
sleep 
study. 
Sleep 
studies

if 
the 
diagnosis 
was 
in

a 
sleep 
study 
was 
carried 
out 
with 
video, 
audio 
and 
pulse 
oximetry 
monitoring 
of 
oxygen 
saturations 
and 
heart 
monitoring. 
Blood 
was 
taken 
during 
the 
general 
anesthetic 
and 
sent 
for 
RAST 
testing 
(Pharmacia 
Immunocap) 
to 
house 
dust 
mite 
(dermatophygoides 
pteryonyssinus), 
feathers, 
grass 
pollen, 
cat 
hair, 
and 
dog 
hair. 
Informed 
consent 
for 
taking 
a 
blood 
sample 
peri-operatively 
to 
investigate 
allergy 
and 
to 
take 
part 
in 
the 
study 
was 
obtained 
from 
the 
parents 
of 
the 
patients 
preoperatively. 
All 
the 
parents 
consented 
to 
this. 
The 
RAST 
result 
was 
graded 
0 
(no 
reactivity) 
to 
6 
(strongly 
reactive). 
Tonsils 
were 
also 
sent 
for 
histological 
examination 
which 
is 
routine 
practice 
at 
our 
center. 
This 
study 
was 
discussed 
with 
the 
local 
ethics 
committee 
but 
as 
RAST 
testing 
in 
this 
patient 
group 
was 
routine 
practice 
in 
our 
department 
before 
the 
start 
of 
the 
study 
it 
was 
deemed 
that 
ethics 
approval 
was 
not 
required 
as 
this 
was 
an 
audit 
of 
our 
current 
practice. 


3. 
Results 
One 
hundred 
and 
seventeen 
patients 
were 
included 
in 
the 
study 
(Table 
1) 
with 
a 
mean 
age 
of 
4.5 
years 
(range 
1—14). 
Seven 
patients 
were 
not 
included 
due 
to 
clinical 
error.

4. 
Discussion 
Atopy 
is 
defined 
as 
an 
abnormal 
immediate 
hypersensitivity 
to 
certain 
allergens 
that 
is 
related 
to 
the 
production 
of 
the 
IgE 
antibody. 
RAST 
testing 
is 
a 
method 
of 
quantifying 
the 
amount 
of 
allergen 
specific 
IgE 
in 
the 
blood. 
The 
allergen 
being 
tested 
is 
chemically 
bound 
to 
an 
insoluble 
matrix 
such 
as 
cellulose. 
The 
patient’s 
serum 
is 
then 
added 
to 
this 
so 
that 
specific 
IgE 
binds 
to 
the 
antigen. 
Radioactively 
labeled 
anti-IgE 
is 
then 
added, 
this 
binds 
to 
the 
allergen 
specific 
IgE 
and 
can 
then 
be 
quantified 
due 
to 
its 
radioactivity. 
Skin 
prick 
allergy 
tests 
may 
be 
more 
sensitive 
than 
RAST 
tests 
for 
nasal 
allergy 
but 
there 
is 
a 
difficulty 
in 
quantifying 
the 
severity 
of 
the 
reaction 
as 
well 
as 
interpersonal 
variation 
in 
the 
interpretation 
of 
the 
results 
whereas 
RAST 
is 
a 
reliable, 
robust 
and 
repeatable 
test 
of 
atopy. 


Rates 
of 
atopy 
are 
known 
to 
vary 
widely 
from 
region 
to 
region 
[4], 
even 
with 
in 
the 
same 
country 
and 
different 
studies 
have 
used 
different 
methodology 
for 
defining 
atopy 
and 
allergic 
rhinitis 
such 
as 
questionnaires 
[5] 
and 
skin 
prick 
allergy 
tests 
[6]. 
Evidence 
in 
the 
literature 
shows 
that 
our 
results 
broadly 
correlate 
with 
what 
would 
be 
expected 
in 
the 
normal 
population 
[7—9] 
and 
are 
certainly 
less 
than 
rates 
that 
have 
been 
seen 
in 
patients 
with 


middle 
ear 
effusion 
[10,11] 
and 
asthma 
[12] 
(Table 
3). 


Chng 
et 
al. 
have 
previously 
shown 
an 
association 
between 
snoring 
in 
the 
pediatric 
patient 
and 
atopy 
from 
a 
questionnaire 
survey 
[13]. 
McColley 
et 
al. 
showed 
that 
in 
a 
group 
of 
pediatric 
patients 
with 
habitual 
snoring 
those 
with 
a 
positive 
RAST 
test 
to 
a 
non-specific 
mixture 
of 
food 
and 
inhalant 
allergens 
were 
significantly 
more 
likely 
to 
suffer 
from 
OSA 
[14]. 
The 
evidence 
that 
we 
have 
produced 
here 
does 
not 
support 
the 
hypothesis 
that 
the 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy 
seen 
in 
pediatric 
patients 
with 
OSA 
is 
contributed 
to 
by 
allergy 
to 
airborne 
allergens. 
Therefore 
routine 
testing 
of 
patients 
who 
have 
no 
symptoms 
of 
upper 
airway 
allergy 
is 
of 
no 
value. 
If 
allergy 
is 
suspected, 
RAST 
testing 
for 
house 
dust 
mite 
and 
mixed 
grass 
pollen 
are 
likely 
to 
give 
the 
highest 
yield. 
Despite 
the 
findings 
in 
this 
paper 
the 
authors 
feel 
strongly 
that 
allergy 
in 
the 
upper 
aerodigestive 
tract 
is 
an 
important 
factor 
in 
the 
development 
of 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy 
in 
pediatric 
OSA. 
Lymphoid 
hypertrophy 
secondary 
to 
antigenic 
stimulation 
is 
seen 
in 
other 
parts 
of 
the 
body 
such 
as 
the 
intestine 
of 
patients 
with 
celiac 
disease 
and

these 
patients

leads 
to 
a 
resolution

the 
hypertrophy 
of 
the

associated 
lymphoid 
tissue

that 
an 
allergic 
reaction 
on 
the 
mucosal 
surface 
of 
the 
adenoids 
and 
tonsils 
predisposes 
them 
to 
a 
viral 
insult 
and 
secondary 
bacterial 
colonization. 
We 
believe 
that 
this 
then 
leads 
to 
a 
chronic 
local 
infection 
with 
secondary 
lymphoid 
hypertrophy. 
The 
difficulty 
is 
in 
demonstrating 
this 
allergy. 
Zimmerman 
et 
al. 
have 
demonstrated 
difficulties 
in 
carrying 
out 
RAST 
tests 
to 
airborne 
allergens 
in 
children 
less 
than 
3 
and 
suggested 
that 
this 
was 
because 
the 
antibodies 
were 
not 
fully 
developed 
in 
this 
age 
group 
[16] 
and 
it 
has 
also 
been 
shown 
that 
the 
reaction 
produced 
by 
skin 
prick 
tests 
is 
reduced 
in 
very 
young 
children 
due 
to 
reduced 
reactivity 
of 
the 
skin 
to 
histamine 
[17].To 
look 
at 
the 
effect 
this 
may 
have 
had 
on 
our 
results 
we 
analyzed 
the 
data 
by 
splitting 
the 
data 
into 
different 
age 
groups 
(Table 
4) 
and 
testing 
the 
significance 
of 
the 
differences 
with 
the 
chi-squared 
test. 
It 
can 
be 
seen 
from 
this 
table 
that 
the 
greatest 
difference 
came 
when 
isolating 
the 
1 
year 
olds 
and 
the 
1—2year 
old 
from 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
group 
but 
this 
was 
not 
statistically 
significant. 
Ciprandi 
et 
al. 
have 
shown 
that 
eosinophils 
demonstrated 
on 
a 
nasal 
smear 
correlate 
strongly 
with 
clinical 
and 
immunological 
parameters 
of 
allergic 
rhinitis 
in 
adults 
[18] 
and 
we 
plan 
to 
use 
this 
technique 
for 
the 
focus 
of 
our 
next 
study.
