Abstract 

Aim: Polysomnography (PSG) is the current standard protocol for sleep disordered breathing (SDB) investigation in 
children. Presently, there are limited reliable screening tests for both central (CE) and obstructive (OE) respiratory events. 
This study compared three indices, derived from pulse oximetry and electrocardiogram (ECG), with the PSG gold 
standard. These indices were heart rate (HR) variability, arterial blood oxygen de-saturation (SaO2) and pulse transit time 
(PTT). Methods: 15 children (12 male) from routine PSG studies were recruited (aged 314 years). The characteristics of 
the three indices were based on known criteria for respiratory events (RPE). Their estimation singly and in combination was 
evaluated with simultaneous scored PSG recordings. Results: 215 RPE and 215 tidal breathing events were analysed. For 
OE, the obtained sensitivity was HR (0.703), SaO2 (0.047), PTT (0.750), considering all three indices (0) and either of the 
indices (0.828) while specificity was (0.891), (0.938), (0.922), (0.953) and (0.859) respectively. For CE, the sensitivity was 
HR (0.715), SaO2 (0.278), PTT (0.662), considering all indices (0.040) and either of the indices (0.868) while specificity 
was (0.815), (0.954), (0.901), (0.960) and (0.762) accordingly. 

Conclusions: Preliminary findings herein suggest that the later combination of these non-invasive indices to be a promising 
screening method of SDB in children. 

Key Words: Sleep apnoea, hypopnoea, oximetry, heart rate variability, pulse transit time, oxygen saturation 

Introduction 

Nocturnal polysomnography (PSG) is the accepted 
diagnostic test for sleep disordered breathing (SDB) in 
children [1]. However, this is a limited resource with no 
simple screening test to facilitate prioritisation, clinical 
symptoms and signs distinguishing poorly between 
normal sleep and significant SDB. The development 
of screening tests, based on appropriate and simply 
monitored physiological signals can prove most valuable 
in prioritising PSG studies, and may allow for 
institution of therapy [2]. It is clear that SDB may 
produce a variety of immediate physiologic consequences. 
The commonly assessed consequences are 
oxygen desaturation, electroencephalogram (EEG) 
arousal and a variety of autonomic activation indices 
like increases in heart rate (HR) and/or blood pressure 
(BP). Thus, many of the screening tests are based on 
known autonomic arousal markers such as variations in 

HR [34], peripheral vasoconstriction [5] and pulse 
transit time (PTT) [3,6]. Such markers are, at least in 
part, manifestations of the orienting reflex response to 
alerting stimuli during sleep. This reflex does not 
habituate to recurrent arousing stimuli and so is 
considered to be a sensitive marker of transient arousal 
stimuli [4]. It is further suggested that measurement of 
a single physiologic consequence may be limited in 
detecting SDB [12]. Hence, the objectives of this 
study performed on children were to assess: (1) the 
independent use of three physiologic indices of HR, 
arterial blood oxygen saturation (SaO2) and PTT in 
detecting SDB events against corresponding PSG 
scorings; and (2) their combined use. 

Methods 

Routine overnight PSG was performed in the 
sleep laboratory with monitoring that included EEG

USA), HR estimations from a single-lead electrocardiogram 
(ECG) monitor (S&W Medico, Teknik, 
Denmark). The studies were continuously observed 
and recorded by a PSG system (Uniquant system, 
LaMont Medical Inc., Wisconsin, USA). Recommended 
criteria for children were used for scoring 
respiratory events (RPE) [7]. To simplify the categorising 
process, central apnoea or hypopnoea were 
regarded as central event (CE) in this study. Similarly, 
obstructive apnoea or hypopnoea were classified as 
obstructive event (OE). Mixed apnoeas or hypopnoeas 
were also classified as OE to simplify the 
comparison process. A stand-alone microcontrollerbased 
device was used to estimate PTT with a 1 ms 
resolution [8]. 

Children were eligible if they had a diagnostic PSG 
study following referral for investigation of SDB. This 
study included 15 children (12 male) aged 8.89/3.0 
years. Their height and weight were 1.309/0.24 m 
and 36.99/22.5 kg respectively. Verbal instruction and 
consent were obtained from children and their caregiver 
prior to any test activity. Institutional ethical 
approval was also given for the study. The presence of 

SDB events were verified against the corresponding 
readings of both the RIP and oronasal airflow 
measures based on standard PSG criteria [7]. Increased 
breathing efforts are seen on RIP monitoring 
of children as de-synchronization of chest and abdominal 
movements. As cardiac diseases can affect 
the isometric contraction time of the left ventricle that 
forms a major part of the measured PTT [6], children 
with coexisting cardiac diseases were excluded in this 
study. 

All SDB events were identified manually by two 
blinded observers who were not aware of the present 
study. For each OE, the following characteristics were 
evaluated: (1) SaO2 de-saturation of ]/4% within 10 s 
of event termination [4,9]; (2) increase in HR by 
]/6bpm in the 10s following the event using its 
baseline calculated 10 s after the event [4,10]; and 

(3) decrease in PTT by 15ms from its baseline for at 
least a 5 s period as the presence of OE [6]. Similar 
HR and SaO2 evaluations were applied to the CE. For 
the PTT measurement, the variance of PTT has 
previously been shown to indicate the occurrence of 
CE [8]. Hence, (4) a decrease in PTT SD of 5/4ms 
over a 10 sample period was used instead. A typical 
PSG recording of OE and CE are illustrated in Figure 
1. As PTT is a semi-quantitative inspiratory effort 
measure, PTT examination needs to be determined 
over several breaths by observing the relative fluctuations 
from its baseline history value [6,8]. In this 
study, the classifications of RPE are performed by 
using the 10 PTT samples associated with each event. 
For each valid RPE, data from the three indices was 
Figure 1. (A) PSG recordings of an OE that leads to significant PTT variations when compared to prior tidal breathing PTT baseline can 
be observed. (B) Epochs of CE which have relatively minimal PTT variations. Due to their proximity, the first two events (as indicated by 
the circular notation in the figure) can be mistaken as one event based on the indices’ characteristics used in the present study. SOE and 
EOE denote the start and end of OE while SCE and ECE denote the start and end of CE respectively. 


Screening of sleep disordered breathing with three indices 563 

extracted for the duration of the event and for an 
equal duration of tidal breathing directly prior to the 
event. This was to give an equal amount of data for 
both the tidal breathing events and the respiratory 
events. In this study, sensitivity (Se) is defined as the 
probability of correctly identifying a true positive OE 
or CE event. Specificity (Sp) is the probability of 
correctly identifying a true negative tidal breathing 
event. Positive predictive value (PPV) is the probability 
that a child with a positive test having OE or 
CE. Negative predictive value (NPV) is the probability 
that a child with a negative test not having OE 
or CE. Statistical analysis was performed using the 
Excel XP (Microsoft Corporation, Seattle, USA) and 
Matlab (R14, the Mathworks Inc., Natick, USA) 
packages. 

Results 

The recorded mean total sleep time (TST) was 
6.989/1.50 h with sleep efficiency of 85.49/13.7%. 
The total number of OE and CE occurred in the 
PSG studies were 87 and 156 respectively. Hence, 
the associated mean apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) 
was found to be 2.259/1.93. From the 243 identified 
PSG RPE, only 215 of them (64 OE and 151 CE) 
were considered as suitable for comparison with 
the PSG scorings. The exclusion of the remaining 
events can be due: (1) events with motion artefact; 

(2) RPE with less than 15 s apart (the proximity 
of these events can affect the characteristics accuracy 
used here as illustrated by Figure 1); or (3) scoring 
discrepancies between the two blinded observers. 
Another 215 tidal breathing events were also recorded 
as part of the analysis. 
With the 430 recorded events, the Se, Sp, PPV 
and NPV were calculated for the three indices: 
HR, SaO2 and PTT. Based on the individual 
results, they were then combined with the other 
two indices to produce a complex classification. 
If the indices are combined with a logic OR statement, 
then an event s detected if either of the 
individual conditions is met. Combining indices in 
this way potentially results in a classification 
with increased Se and NPV, but reduced Sp and 
PPV compared to the individual indices. If the 
indices are combined with a logic AND statement, 
then an event is detected only if all conditions are 
met. This potentially results in a classification 
with increased Sp, but with all other measures 
reduced. The results obtained with single indices 
and combinations of indices for both OE and CE 
are given in Table 1. It is worth noting there can be 
numerous combinations with the indices, but only the 
most restrictive (HR AND SaO2 AND PTT) and 
least restrictive (HR OR SaO2 OR PTT) are presented 
here.

Discussion 

The benefits of simple and accessible SDB screening 
for children are obvious. Numerous techniques 
and screening tools have been developed with results 
of clinical trials showing diverse implications [2]. 
Despite this, diagnostic PSG remains the gold 
standard against which these techniques are 
compared [1,7]. The present study has investigated 
the usefulness of HR, SaO2 and PTT indices in 
screening for SDB in children. 

In the obtained recordings, 28 out of the 243 RPE 
scored by the PSG studies were excluded. This is 
expected as with few and simpler instruments, artefact 
minimisation and scoring criteria can become less 
ideal. Based on the remaining 215 events, it is shown 
that by using these indices, either on their own or in 
combination, various practical levels of Se and Sp, 
and hence PPV and NPV, can be achieved. For 
example, in a diagnostic application it is important 
to have both high Se and Sp whilst for screening 
applications a lower Sp (and therefore increased 
false alarms) can be tolerated. In particular, the 
OR combination shows an improved Se, with only 
marginally reduced Sp. However, the AND combination 
results in a significantly lower Se, but higher Sp. 
As for OE, where the most accurate single index was 
mean PTT, the most accurate single index for CE is 
based on the SD of PTT. However, it has been shown 
that classification based on mean PTT decrease is 
unable to detect CE [8]. These results suggest that 
selected test outcomes coupled with a strong clinical 
SDB suspicion may prove useful for clinicians in their 
investigations. 

It is worth noting that the present study has some 
limitations. First, Pes monitoring is not included in 


564 J. Y. A. Foo et al. 

this study despite being the reference method 
for measuring changes in negative intrathoracic 
pressures and inspiratory efforts [6]. It is excluded 
due to the possible lack of patient acceptability and 
interference with the accuracy of the PSG [3,6]. 
Second, present literature suggests that there is a 
significant correlation between Pes and PTT [6]. 
In addition, the study population does not have 
significant symptoms of SDB. Hence, future work 
can involve a second group of paediatric patients, 
especially those with known significant SDB symptoms. 
Third, the facility of these indices has not 
been tested in a non-hospital environment including a 
standalone time indication for the indices besides that 
of the PSG system. However, the preliminary results 
herein suggest the possibility for further investigations 
in such a setting. 

Conclusions 

From this study, it can be seen that the combination 
OR of HR, SaO2 and PTT has the potential to be a 
useful screening tool for SDB. It fulfils the criteria for 
simplicity as it only requires the recordings of signals 
from the ECG and oximetry. This requires fewer 
electrodes for the study when compared to some other 
remote sleep study systems. Furthermore, both the 
ECG and oximetry can be generally implemented 
with portable devices. Hence, further investigations 

can be conducted to test their suitability in domiciliary 
monitoring of SDB in the paediatric population.
