Abstract 
Objectives: 
There is an association between sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and 
Nocturnal enuresis; nocturia in adults, raising the question as to whether SDB could play a role in the aetiology of 
Sleep disordered nocturnal enuresis (NE) in children. The aim of this study was to determine whether there is an 
breathing association between these two conditions. 
Methods: 
The study group comprised 40 patients, aged 5e15 years, with enuresis and the 
control group 40 children undergoing routine day-case surgery. Subjects completed a Pediatric 
Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ) and a questionnaire assessing lower tract symptoms. Categorical 
variables were analysed using Pearson’s Xi2 test, and group differences for continuous variables 
using ManneWhitney and KruskaleWallis tests or t-tests according to the distribution 
of data. 
Results: 
The groups were well matched. Patients with NE had significantly higher total PSQ 
scores (P 
< 
0.001). PSQ subscales relating to daytime sleepiness (P 
< 
0.003) and daytime 
behaviour (P 
< 
0.000) were significantly worse in NE patients. The snoring subscale was not 
statistically different (P 
< 
0.051), but a comparison of females alone showed a highly significant 
difference (P 
< 
0.001) with higher snoring subscale scores in girls with NE. 
Conclusion: 
Children with NE had significantly higher PSQ scores. The data suggest an 
association between NE and SDB in girls. The significantly higher level of reports of daytime 
sleepiness and behavioural problems in all NE children warrants further study to determine 
the potential causative pathways and clinical relevance of these findings. SDB could be usefully 
assessed in children with NE, particularly when they do not respond to standard treatment.

Introduction 


Nocturnal enuresis (NE) and sleep-disordered breathing 
(SDB) are common problems during childhood. NE affects 
between 2% and 15% of 5e15 year olds [1]. SDB is a term 
that describes a spectrum of upper airway obstruction in 
sleep from primary snoring, which is reported in 10% of 
pre-school children [2], to obstructive sleep apnoea 
with community prevalence rates between 0.9% and 
4.3% [3]. There is a recognized link between SDB and 
polyuria/nocturia in adults [4e7]. Thus it would be fair 
to hypothesize that the nocturnal polyuria frequently 
seen in children with NE could be associated with SDB 
[8]. The aetiology of monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis 
(MNE) is multifactorial, but one factor is thought to 
be a lack of nocturnal arginine vasopressin (AVP) release 
causing polyuria [9]. This finding has led to the use of 
desmopressin (dDAVP), an AVP analogue that reduces 
urine production and increases urine concentration, in 
the treatment of NE [10]. Studies have shown a high success 
rate with dDAVP treatment over placebo, with 70% 
improvement in the number of dry nights, but only 
24.5% of children became completely dry [11]. This suggests 
a non-AVP mechanism causing nocturnal polyuria 
in some children. One possible mechanism is increased 
nocturnal atrial naturetic peptide (ANP) secretion, as 
seen in adults with SDB [5]. 

Recent literature indicates an association between SDB 
and NE. Studies have principally focused on uncontrolled 
clinical populations of children with SDB either undergoing 
assessment in sleep laboratories [12] or adenotonsillectomy 
[13]. A causative relationship is inferred from 
evidence that nocturnal enuresis ameliorates following 
adenotonsillectomy [14], although lack of control data 
in these studies limits their conclusions. Compelling evidence 
for an association between SDB and NE was reported 
in a large Greek community sample of children 
aged 5e14 years [2]. Children with habitual snoring 
were 4 times more likely than those who did not regularly 
snore to have primary enuresis. The study had 
some limitations, however, as it did not use an SDB 
screening tool sensitive to case definition for obstructive 
sleep apnoea, and it is known that snoring symptomatology 
alone correlates poorly with objective (polysomnographic) 
findings [15]. We aimed to study the 
prevalence of SDB using a validated screening tool in 
a controlled clinical population of children with well classified 
enuresis. 

Patients 
and 
methods 


Ethical approval was obtained from the Isle of Wight, 
Portsmouth and South-east Hampshire Research Ethics 
Committee. 

Study 
population 


Children aged 5e15 years attending a community enuretic 
clinic were enrolled in the study. A control group was recruited 
from children undergoing routine elective day-
case surgery not related to the urinary tract or ear, nose 

and throat conditions. Controls were selected to be similar 
with respect to age and gender. 

Measures 


All parents completed the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire 
(Appendix A) [16], a brief screening questionnaire for childhood 
SDB where a score of >0.33 (positive response scores 1 
and negative 0) has a sensitivity of 0.85 and specificity of 

0.81 for a commonly used clinical threshold for diagnosis 
of obstructive sleep apnoea (apnoea/hypopnoea index 
>5/h). Snoring (Q 1e4), sleepiness (Q 10e13) and behavioural 
subscales (final 6 items) within the PSQ can be separately 
analysed as factors such as NE may independently 
disrupt sleep and cause behavioural problems and somnolence 
during the day [17]. These subscales are of value in 
the study of children with NE, as the enuresis may independently 
disrupt sleep leading to behavioural problems and 
somnolence during the day [17]. NE was classified as primary 
or secondary, mono or non-monosymptomatic and 
by severity (mild, 2/week; moderate, 2e4/week; severe, 
>5/week). 
Statistical 
analysis 


Data were analysed using SPSS for windows (v.14). Data 
were examined for normality using the ShapiroeWilk test. 
Dichotomous group variables were analysed using Pearson’s 
Xi2 test. Group difference for non-parametric continuous 
variables (e.g. total PSQ scores) were analysed using 
ManneWhitney and KruskaleWallis tests and between parametric 
variables using t-tests. Significance limits were set 
at P 
< 
0.05. 

Results 


Forty study patients and 40 control patients were successfully 
recruited. There were no significant group differences 
in age and gender (Table 1). 

PSQ 
scores 


Total PSQ (P 
< 
0.001), daytime sleepiness (P 
< 
0.003) and 
behavioural subscale scores (P 
< 
0.000) were highly significantly 
different between the groups, with enuretic children 
exhibiting more problems (Figs. 1e3). The snoring subscale 
did not quite reach significance (P 
Z 
0.051) between the 
groups (Fig. 4). This suggests that the total PSQ score

was confirmed by a highly significant difference in snoring 
subscales (P

were compared to the 11 female controls (Fig. 5). 

Discussion 


To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to 
examine the prevalence of SDB symptoms in a controlled 
clinical sample of enuretic children. Patients with NE had 
significantly higher total PSQ scores compared to controls 
(P 
< 
0.001). No significant differences were found between 
enuretic children based on characteristics such as primary

and secondary enuresis, MNE and non-MNE, severity or age. 
There was a highly significant gender difference on the 
snoring subscale alone suggesting increased prevalence of 
snoring amongst females. 

These findings, from a controlled study, provide some 
support to retrospective and anecdotal reports of an 
association between NE and SDB, largely reported in the 
ear, nose and throat and maxillo-facial literature. The 
gender difference has not previously been reported 
although nocturnal enuresis is less common in girls, and 
it may be that there should be a lower threshold for 
considering SDB in female enuretics. Weider and colleagues 
reported on 115 13e19 year olds, with a combination 
of SDB and NE, who underwent tonsillectomy and/or 
adenoidectomy [18]. At 1 month following surgery 66% 
had improved, at 6 months 77% and this remained constant 
at 12 months. There are two further large retrospective 
series, describing a total of 181 patients 
between them, reporting a cure rate of NE following tonsillectomy 
in excess of 60% [19,20]. In one prospective 
study, 10 patients with SDB and NE underwent rapid maxillary 
expansion, four were cured of NE and three improved 
[21]. These data lend some support to an 
association between SDB and NE, with a possible therapeutic 
benefit following treatment of SDB. However, the 
evidence from polysomnographic studiesdthe gold standard 
for the assessment of SDBdis more contradictory. 

A number of polysomnographic studies compared patients 
with MNE to controls and in general found no 
evidence of SDB, but did note that enuretic patients had 
a high arousal threshold [22e24]. Brooks and Topol studied 
66 patients with NE using polysomnography [12]. They 
found a positive association between the respiratory disturbance 
index and enuresis: the higher the index the greater 
the enuresis [12]. One further study, evaluating the accuracy 
of clinical evaluation in paediatric obstructive sleep 
apnoea, noted that 11/24 (46%) subjects with polysomnographic 
evidence of obstructive sleep apnoea suffered 
from NE [25]. Richards and Ferdman studied the delays in 

diagnosis of SDB in children in an attempt to reduce morbidity, 
and one of the clear predictors of SDB was NE [26]. 

The cause of SDB in children is unclear, but is thought to 
be a dynamic process resulting from a combination of 
structural and neuromotor abnormalities that cause an 
increase in upper airway obstruction during sleep. 
Recognized predisposing factors include adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy, neuromuscular disorders, craniofacial abnormalities 
associated with macroglossia, retrognathia or 
maxillary hypoplasia, and obesity. Adult research indicates 
a strong link between untreated SDB and cardiovascular 
disease. During an apnoeic episode a negative intrathoracic 
pressure is created leading to an increase in venous return 
followed by acute right atrial distension. ANP, a hormone 
that regulates blood volume and pressure, is released from 
the wall of the right atrium in response to this and acts on 
the renal tubules to increase salt and water excretion. 
Hypoxia as a result of SDB has also been found to be 
a contributing factor towards the increase in ANP secretion 
during sleep in adults [27]. This leads to diuresis and an increase 
in urine production subsequently leading to nocturnal 
polyuria. Importantly a recent study in children has 
demonstrated a correlation between brain natriuretic hormone 
(produced by myocytes in the cardiac ventricles) 
and severity of SDB [28]. 

On the basis of the evidence in the literature and the 
results of this current study it would seem that there 
could be an association between SDB and NE in children, 
particularly in girls. The importance of this finding is twofold. 
Firstly, NE could be used as a predictor of SDB 
leading to earlier diagnosis and treatment of SDB, and 
hopefully reducing the significant morbidity associated 
with this condition, such as failure to thrive, behavioural 
problems, neurocognitive deficits, cor pulmonale and 
hypertension [29]. Further larger studies using objective 
measures of SDB are required to confirm our findings 
and in particular to explore gender differences. Secondly, 
the identification of SDB may open new therapeutic pathways, 
discussed above, for those patients with NE who do 
not respond to standard treatment. The PSQ [16] has 
been shown to be very easy to complete and analyse. 
There is no reason why it could not be used in the primary 
assessment of all enuretic children and, if positive, 
these children could be investigated further in appropriate 
sleep clinics. 

It is intriguing that the enuretic children displayed 
significantly greater difficulties in the symptom domains 
of day-time somnolence and behavioural problems compared 
to the control population. The PSQ is designed to 
assess primary symptoms of SDB as well as secondary daytime 
behavioural consequences. Neurobehavioural difficulties 
in children with SDB are hypothesized to result from 
a combination of disrupted sleep architecture as well as 
repetitive hypoxia [30]. Polysomnographic studies suggest 
that, in contrast, enuretic children have a high arousal 
threshold, so disrupted sleep architecture seems an unlikely 
explanation for our findings. The behavioural difficulties 
suggested by our data are novel and unexpected 
findings and deserve further study to ascertain whether 
they relate to SDB, are an independent characteristic of 
the enuretic population or are associated with characteristics 
not measured in this study such as sleep hygiene.
