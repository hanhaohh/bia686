Study Objectives: Cross-sectional studies implicate snoring and sleep-
disordered breathing as potential contributors to hyperactive behavior in 
some children. However, no prospective cohort study has demonstrated 
that symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing precede development of hyperactivity. 
Participants: Parents of 229 children aged 2 to 13 years, recruited at 2 
general pediatrics clinics, completed initial and 4-year follow-up surveys. 
Measurements: Surveys included a validated Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire 
about snoring, sleepiness, and overall risk of sleep-disordered 
breathing, and the hyperactivity index (expressed as a T-score) within the 
Conners’ Parent Rating Scale. 
Results: Thirty children (13%) were rated as hyperactive (hyperactivity 
index > 60) at follow-up. After adjustment for hyperactivity at baseline 
and stimulant use at follow-up, hyperactivity at follow-up was predicted 
by baseline habitual snoring (odds ratio = 4.4, 95% confidence interval 

[1.3, 14.7]) or loud snoring (4.5, [1.2, 17.5]) and by top-quartile composite 
scores for snoring (5.3, [1.7, 16.8]), sleepiness (3.0, [1.0, 9.4]), or sleep-
disordered breathing (4.0, [1.4, 11.6]). 
Conclusions: This 4-year prospective cohort study shows that snoring 
and other symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing are strong risk factors 
for future emergence or exacerbation of hyperactive behavior. These 
findings support the hypothesis that untreated childhood sleep-disordered 
breathing contributes to development of hyperactivity.

INTRODUCTION 

HABITUAL SNORING IS A PROMINENT FEATURE OF 
SLEEP-DISORDERED BREATHING (SDB), AND BOTH ARE 
ASSOCIATED WITH INATTENTIVE AND HYPERACTIVE 
behavior in children.1-4 Several published case series note that 
treatment of SDB can lead to amelioration of hyperactive behavior 
and reduced need for stimulant medication.1,3,5 Survey results 
suggest that if SDB causes or contributes to hyperactivity, then a 
significant minority of hyperactive children, as many as 15% to 
25%, might benefit from diagnosis and treatment of the underlying 
sleep disorder.6,7 A community-based polysomnographic study 
of hyperactive and normal children has found notably increased 
rates of SDB among mildly hyperactive children.8 The American 
Academy of Pediatrics lists behavioral problems as “symptoms” 
and “complications” of childhood SDB.9 Animal models have 
suggested that intermittent hypoxia could affect brain function 
and cause hyperactivity,10,11 but this behavioral outcome is also 
seen in a variety of sleep disorders that do not involve hypoxia,12,13 
implying that sleep disruption also may play an important role. 

Despite this evidence, definitive proof that SDB actually plays 
a causal role in hyperactivity remains elusive. No double-blind, 
randomized, placebo-controlled intervention trials have addressed 
the issue. Among published observational studies that support a

cause-and-effect relationship, one of the most important pieces 
of evidence still missing is proof that SDB temporally precedes 
development of hyperactive behavior.14 We now report results 
of a prospective cohort study designed to address this question. 
Parents of children in community-based general pediatric waiting 
rooms were surveyed with validated instruments to assess sleep 
and daytime behavior.7 Four years later, these families were resurveyed, 
and baseline risk factors for future emergence of hyperactivity 
were assessed. 

METHODS 

Subjects 

Recruitment procedures for this research cohort, as approved 
by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board, have 
been described previously in detail.7,15 Parents with children in 
waiting rooms of 2 University-owned but community-based 
general pediatric practices were asked to sign informed consent 
and assent, respectively, to participate in an Institutional Review 
Board-approved study of sleep and behavior in children. Inclusion 
criteria included (1) age between 2.0 and 13.9 years, (2) 
parental ability to read and write, and (3) absence of mental or 
physical impairment severe enough to preclude interpretation of 
behavioral information collected. Recruitment took place February 
1998 through April 2000. Questionnaires generally required 
20 to 30 minutes to complete. 

Four years after the initial questionnaires were administered, 
the same instruments were mailed to the parent who had originally 
responded, as had been planned at enrollment. Efforts to locate 
families whose addresses had changed included use of alternate 
family contacts that had been provided by parents, medical 
records, phone books, and Internet searches. Duplicate mailings 
were sent, 1 to 2 months after the first, when no responses were 
received from valid addresses. 

Parents of 229 children answered initial question items about 

SLEEP, Vol. 28, No. 7, 2005 885 Snoring Predicts Hyperactivity 4 Year Later—Chervin et al 


SDB symptoms, confirmed that no tonsillectomy had been performed 
between initial evaluation and follow-up, and provided 
hyperactivity ratings at both time points. These 229 children represent 
26% of 866 children included in the original cross-sectional 
survey analysis.7 Children with follow-up data, in comparison 
with the remainder, did not show significant baseline differences 
in age, sex, habitual snoring, or frequency of hyperactive behavior 
(as defined below). However, fewer children with follow-up data 
had loud snoring at follow-up (9 vs 20%), and, on average, these 
children showed somewhat lower snoring scores (mean 0.13 vs 
0.20), slightly lower sleepiness scores (0.14 vs 0.17), and slightly 
lower SDB scores (0.13 vs 0.16, all measures as defined below, P 
< .05 by t test or .2). 

Measures 

For both surveys, parents completed the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire; 
children were encouraged to help. The instrument contains 
a validated, reliable, 22-item SDB scale (see Appendix), 
including a 4-item subscale for snoring and another for excessive 
daytime sleepiness.16 Scores are calculated as the proportion of 
symptoms that are endorsed as present. In the current study, the 
subscales were used in addition to the full 22-item SDB scale because 
the latter contains 6 behavioral items that could potentially 
give rise to artificial associations with future hyperactive behavior. 
Responses to 2 snoring question-items also were analyzed 
separately: “While sleeping, does your child snore loudly?” and 
“While sleeping, does your child snore more than half the time?” 
The latter was used to identify habitual snoring. 

Parents completed the short form of the Conners’ Parent Rating 
Scale, a well-validated 48-item instrument commonly used 
to identify behavioral problems in children.17 The Hyperactivity 
Index (HI) contains 10 symptom items that are rated on a 4-point 
scale. Raw scores are converted to age and sex-adjusted T-scores 
that range from 0 to 100, average 50, and show a standard deviation 
of 10 points. Scores 1 or 2 standard deviations above the 
mean are usually interpreted as indicative of hyperactive behavior. 
In this study, HI > 60 was considered to reflect hyperactive 
behavior. 

Analysis 

Simple logistic regression was used to model high HI at follow-
up as a function of each baseline SDB-related symptom, 
score, age, and sex. As hyperactivity at follow-up was likely to be 
influenced by hyperactivity at baseline and stimulant use at follow-
up, multiple logistic regression was used to take both into account. 
These analyses therefore modeled hyperactivity that newly 
developed or worsened during the 4-year follow-up period, after 
controlling for effects of current stimulant medications. Age and 
sex were not entered as covariates because the HI is already age 
and sex-adjusted and because these 2 variables showed no bivariate 
associations with the outcome. Validity of results were tested 
by controlling for nonstimulant psychotropic medications. 

Two other models were explored. As the initial survey had 
shown that the cross-sectional associations between SDB symptoms 
and HI derived mainly from boys younger than 8 years old,7 
current results were retested within this subsample. To assess 
whether baseline SDB symptoms predicted HI independently of 
current SDB symptoms, follow-up hyperactivity was regressed on 
SDB symptoms from both time points, while adjusting for base


line hyperactivity and follow-up stimulant use. Analyses were 
performed with SAS®, version 8.01 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, 
NC), and the level of significance was set at P < .05. 

RESULTS 

Predictors of Hyperactivity 

Follow-up data on demographics, sleep, and behavior for all 
subjects, those with habitual snoring at baseline, and those without 
habitual snoring at baseline are shown in Table 1. The mean 
HI was 46.3 ± 13.4 at follow-up: 30 children (13%) were rated 
as hyperactive (HI = 60) by their parents, whereas 199 were not. 
Those 30, in comparison with the remainder, showed no difference 
in age or sex but were more likely at baseline to have been 
reported to snore, to be excessively sleepy, and to have high overall 
SDB scores (Table 2 and Figure 1). The 30 children who were 
hyperactive on follow-up were also much more likely than other 
children to have been rated as hyperactive at the initial survey. 
After adjustment for hyperactivity at enrollment (HI = 60, n = 25 
subjects), and for stimulant use at follow-up (n = 13 subjects), 
baseline snoring predicted a 4- to 5-fold increased risk for newly 
developed hyperactivity at follow-up (P < .05 for habitual snoring, 
loud snoring, or snoring score, as shown in Table 2). Baseline 
scores in the top quartile for sleepiness showed a trend toward a 
3-fold increased risk (P = .058), and those in the top quartile on 
the overall SDB scale predicted a 4-fold increased risk (P = .013). 
Additional adjustment of Table 2 models for parental reports of 
follow-up medications that could be classified as nonstimulant 
psychotropic agents, such as hypnotics or antidepressants (n = 
11), showed results essentially identical to those shown in Table 

2. 
Young Boys 

The follow-up sample included 79 boys younger than 8 years 
at enrollment. Ten were found to be hyperactive at follow-up,

and 69 were found not to be hyperactive. Adjusted odds ratios for 
hyperactivity and habitual snoring or sleepiness showed similar 
magnitudes to those found in the whole group but did not reach 
significance with this limited sample size (Table 3). However, 
loud snoring showed a trend, and snoring scores reached significance, 
as did overall SDB scores, with markedly elevated odds 
ratios. For example, baseline scores in the top quartile for the 
overall SDB scale predicted a 9-fold increase in adjusted risk for 
hyperactivity on follow-up (P = .02). 

Past Versus Present Snoring 

Like the baseline SDB symptoms, follow-up habitual snoring, 
loud snoring, snoring scores, sleepiness scores, and SDB scores 
were each also associated with follow-up hyperactivity (all P < 
.05). However, in logistic regression models that included the baseline 
symptom and follow-up symptom as explanatory variables, 
again adjusted for baseline hyperactivity and follow-up stimulant 
use, none of the follow-up symptoms retained significant associations 
with follow-up hyperactivity (all P > .10), except for the follow-
up SDB score (P < .0001). In contrast, in these same models, 
the predictive value and statistical significance of baseline loud 
snoring, snoring score, and sleepiness score remained essentially 
unchanged by adjustment for the follow-up symptoms (Table 4, 
in comparison with Table 2). Baseline habitual snoring and SDB 
scores showed somewhat weakened predictive value that failed to 
reach significance. 

DISCUSSION 

This prospective, 4-year cohort study of children aged 2 to 13 
years at enrollment demonstrates for the first time that snoring 
and other SDB symptoms are strong risk factors for the future development 
of hyperactive behavior. Habitual snoring at baseline 
increased the risk for subsequent hyperactivity by more than 4 
times. Despite a limited sample size of boys younger than 8 years 
old, within this group, subjects in the top quartile for baseline 
SDB symptoms had an estimated 9-fold increased risk for hyperactivity 
4 years later. Although SDB symptoms at follow-up also 
were associated with current hyperactivity, several showed no in-

dependent association after baseline SDB symptoms were taken 
into account. In contrast, some baseline SDB symptoms still predicted 
follow-up hyperactivity after current SDB symptoms were 
taken into account. These results cannot prove that SDB causes 
hyperactive behavior, but they do provide important evidence to 
support this hypothesis. If SDB does contribute to hyperactive 
behavior, then the large magnitude of increased risk conferred by 
SDB in our study highlights the importance of early recognition 
and treatment for childhood SDB in general pediatric practices.

SDB or its symptoms actually precede hyperactive behavior. One

case-control study addressed the question of whether SDB symptoms 
precede poor school performance.18 Poorly-performing seventh- 
and eighth-grade students, ranked in the bottom quartile of 
their class, were compared with students ranked in the top quartile 
on the basis of whether parents recalled snoring when these children 
were 2 to 6 years old. The retrospective design and subject 
ages could not allow assessment of early school performance or 
cognitive ability, and results were not adjusted for stimulant or 
psychotropic use. However, frequent and loud snoring in early 
childhood was reported to be 2.8 times more common among 
poorly performing teenagers than among high-performing teens. 
Interestingly, current snoring did not differ between the 2 groups. 
With a different outcome measure, adjustment for baseline morbidity 
and stimulant use, and a prospective design that avoided 
potential for selective recall, the current cohort study still showed 
associations of similar or greater magnitude: children at most risk 
for SDB at baseline were 4 times more likely to have hyperactive 
behavior 4 years later. 

A randomized controlled clinical trial, in which subjects treated 
for SDB are compared with others left untreated, could prove 
whether SDB contributes to hyperactive behavior. However, such 
a trial has not been performed, in part because of inherent ethical 
considerations. In the absence of such proof, clinical and epidemiologic 
findings that can support a cause-and-effect relationship 
between a putative risk and critical outcome include a strong 
cross-sectional association, biologic credibility of proposed underlying 
mechanisms, proof that the risk factor precedes the outcome 
in time, a dose-response relationship, and, perhaps most 
importantly, consistency among investigations that involve different 
methodologies, investigators, and settings.19 The associations 
between symptoms of SDB, hyperactivity, and other neurobehavioral 
outcomes are strong.4,6-8,20,21 Potential biologic mechanisms 
derive reasonable support from animal and human models:10,22 
hypoxia, sleep fragmentation by arousals, or both could play important 
roles. Symptoms of SDB, and by inference the disorder 
itself, are now shown to precede hyperactive behavior. Previously 
published data have suggested a dose-response association between 
snoring and hyperactivity.7 

The primary remaining challenge to a conclusion that SDB 
contributes to hyperactive behavior is that not all studies on this

relationship—and especially those that have used objective measures 
of SDB—have produced consistent results. For example, 
a study of 113 children referred for evaluation of possible SDB 
showed no clear association between laboratory measures of SDB 
severity and parent-rated hyperactivity.23 A community-based 
study found frequent SDB in 27 mildly hyperactive subjects, in 
comparison with 39 control subjects, but could not find the same 
in 44 more-severely hyperactive children.8 Again, no laboratory 
measure of SDB severity correlated with neurobehavioral morbidity. 
Another community-based study of 69 children with SDB 
and 70 children without SDB, as determined by home polysomnography, 
showed no difference between groups in parent ratings 
for inattention, hyperactivity, and symptoms of attention-deficit/ 
hyperactivity disorder.20 Most recently, a study of 205 five-yearold 
children found that scores on cognitive tests of attention and 
other domains were relatively poor among subjects who had SDB 
symptoms, but were no different after children with polysomnographic 
evidence of SDB were removed from the analyses.24 

One problem may be that objective measures of SDB remain 
to be optimized.25 Standard measures of SDB such as the apnea-
hypopnea index (frequency per hour of sleep), even when 
adapted specifically for children, may not effectively identify 
patients likely to suffer from neurobehavioral morbidity.26 Better 
opportunities may involve specialized scoring of respiratory 
and nonrespiratory arousals27 or computerized quantification of 
electroencephalographic changes that occur on a breath-to-breath 
basis rather than at the end of apneic events.28 In adults, a reported 
history of snoring still predicts sleepiness after the objective 
apnea-hypopnea index is taken into account.29 Another problem 
could be that childhood hyperactivity may arise only from SDB 
that has occurred years before. If so, then cross-sectional measures 
of SDB, which could have long since resolved with earlier 
regression of tonsillar hypertrophy, may not show close correlation 
with the SDB outcome. 

Among limitations of the current study, one that is difficult to 
avoid in a large long-term follow-up survey is that only a minority 
of eligible participants provided data again at 4 years. However, 
the effect may well have been to make our findings more 
conservative: the lower frequency of some baseline symptoms of 
SDB among participants, in comparison with those lost to follow-
