Summary. Higher or similar systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure has been recorded in children 
with sleep apnea compared to subjects with primary snoring or in those with primary snoring 
compared to controls. To investigate the association between blood pressure and habitual snoring, 
we studied children in four randomly selected schools in central Greece. A symptom questionnaire 
was answered by parents, and children’s weight, height, and blood pressure were measured. 
Seven hundred and sixty children (4–14 years old; 352 female) were recruited. Fifty of 760 (6.6%) 
participants were snoring more than 3 nights/week (habitual snorers). Mean (SD) systolic blood 
pressure was 106.9 (10.6) mmHg in habitual snorers vs. 107 (12) in nonhabitual snorers 
(P 
> 
0.05). Mean diastolic blood pressure was 61.9 (7.6) in the former vs. 61.8 (6.8) in the latter 
(P 
> 
0.05). While age, gender, and body mass index were significant predictors of systolic blood 
pressure in a general linear model, snoring was not. Similarly, that gender and body mass index but 
not snoring were significant predictors of diastolic blood pressure. In a community sample of 
children, habitual snorers do not have higher morning systolic or diastolic blood pressure than 
nonhabitual snorers. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2005; 39:408–414. .

INTRODUCTION 

Obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea in adults has been 
associated with systemic hypertension, coronary artery 
disease, congestive heart failure, and stroke.1–3 Several 
studies investigated the correlation between obstructive 
sleep apnea-hypopnea and hypertension in adults,4–6 and 
a few reports focused on systemic blood pressure measurements 
in children with obstructive sleep-disordered 
breathing.7–11 

Opinions differ on whether snoring is a risk factor for 
hypertension in children. In some reports, children with 
obstructive sleep apnea were found to have higher daytime 
and nocturnal diastolic blood pressure than subjects with 
primary snoring, and those with primary snoring greater 
daytime systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared to 
healthy controls without snoring.7,8 Others detected no 
difference in systolic and diastolic pressure during sleep 
between children with obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea 
and primary snoring.11 

While adult studies included large numbers of subjects 
from the general population,4–6 only one pediatric report 
(Tucson Children’s Assessment of Sleep Apnea (TuCASA) 
Study) addressed blood pressure trends associated with 
sleep-disordered breathing in a community sample.10 
The aims of the present investigation were: 1) to obtain 
morning blood pressure measurements in a population 
sample of children and adolescents attending nursery, 
elementary, and high schools in the city of Larissa (central 

. 
2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc. 
Greece); and 2) to associate these measurements with the 
presence of habitual snoring. Our hypothesis was that 
children with habitual snoring have higher systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure during wakefulness than subjects 
without snoring.

consent was obtained from parents of all participants. 
The questionnaire was prepared based on previous studies 
(Appendix).12–14 Questions were answered by yes/no or 
by a 5-point frequency scale (0 ¼ 
never, 1 ¼ 
only with 
colds, 2 ¼ 
less frequently than once a week, 3 ¼ 
1–3 nights 
a week, 4 ¼ 
more frequently than 3 nights a week) and a 
‘‘do not know’’ category. Questions inquired about: 1) 
present and past medical history (symptoms of sleep-
disordered breathing present for the last 6 months, history 
of lower respiratory tract illness, chronic nasal obstruction, 
adenoidectomy and tonsillectomy, or other health 
problems); and 2) information related to sleep-disordered 
breathing in family members. 

We randomly selected one nursery school, two elementary 
schools, and the lowest grade of one high school 
among those located in the Larissa school district. The 
target population had an age range of 4–14 years, which 
was similar to participants’ age ranges in other pediatric 
studies.7,8,11 The population of the district is homogeneous 
regarding socioeconomic status, and students from 
different schools are similar regarding this variable. All 
students from each selected school and grade were given 
the opportunity to participate in the study. During the first 
phase of the protocol, the questionnaire form and a letter 
explaining the aims of the study and giving instructions for 
completion of the form were sent to parents. After students 
returned the completed questionnaire to teachers, two 
registered nurses visited each class to collect the forms and 
to perform study measurements. Both nurses were blind to 
subjects’ snoring status. 

All children who returned a completed questionnaire 
and who did not fulfill certain exclusion criteria underwent 
weight, height, and blood pressure measurements. Similar 
to the study by Marcus et al.,7 exclusion 
criteria 
were the 
following: 1) history of cardiac disease; 2) history of renal 
disease; and 3) a diagnosis of any disorder or use of any 
medications (e.g., inhaled beta-adrenergic agonists) that 
could affect blood pressure. Children receiving inhaled 
beta-adrenergic agonists were excluded if the medication 
was administered in the morning prior to blood pressure 
measurement. Excluded subjects did not undergo study 
measurements. 

Standing height was measured in bare feet with a stadiometer. 
Weight was determined without shoes, in light 
indoor clothes, and with empty pockets. Blood pressure 
was measured three times by an oscillometric method 
(Dinamap Pro 100, Critikon, Tampa, FL). Blood pressure 
cuff selection and blood pressure measurement procedure 
were carried out according to recommendations by the 
Working Group on Hypertension Control in Children and 
Adolescents.15 

Data Analysis 

Children with snoring for more than 3 nights/week were 
defined as habitual 
snorers. History of chronic nasal 

Blood Pressure and Snoring 409 

obstruction was a report of congested nose for more than 
3 months over the past 6 months or a physician’s diagnosis 
of chronic rhinitis. History of lower respiratory tract 
illness was defined as persistent cough with colds for 
more than 10 days, use of a bronchodilator or physician’s 
diagnosis of wheezing, bronchitis, or bronchial asthma. 
Body mass index was equal to the weight in kilograms 
divided by the square of the height in meters. 

Habitual snorers and nonhabitual snorers were compared 
regarding blood pressure values, characteristics 
that may affect blood pressure, and symptoms related to 
sleep-disordered breathing. For the purpose of statistical 
analysis, three blood pressure readings in each subject 
were averaged.15 Comparison of continuous variables was 
completed by unpaired t-test and of categorical characteristics 
by w 
2 test (Yates’ correction). 

Evaluation of the effect of habitual snoring, adjusted for 
possible covariates (age, gender, and body mass index) 
and of the interaction between habitual snoring and the 
covariates on systolic blood pressure values, was completed 
by a general linear model. A similar method was 
employed to assess the effect of the previous variables on 
diastolic blood pressure. Statistical analysis was performed 
using the statistical software SAS, version 6.04 
(Cary Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). P 
< 
0.05 was considered 
statistically significant. 

RESULTS 

Patient Characteristics 

In total, 820 questionnaires were distributed in four 
randomly selected schools, and 760 children (93%) underwent 
study measurements. The age range of participants 
was 4–14 years. Questionnaires were not returned for 
27 children, while 16 children (two habitual snorers) with 
completed questionnaires were absent on the day the study 
nurses visited their class. One boy was excluded due to a 
history of repaired coarctation of the aorta and 16 more 
subjects secondary to use of inhaled beta-adrenergic 
agonists in the morning prior to blood pressure measurements. 
Only 1 of 16 subjects was a habitual snorer. Fifty of 
760 participants (6.6%) were habitual snorers, as reported 
by their parents. 

Characteristics that may be associated with blood 
pressure in habitual snorers vs. nonhabitual snorers are 
presented in Table 1. There were no differences between 
the two groups regarding age, weight, height, and body 
mass index. In the habitual snorers group, there were more 
boys than in the nonhabitual snorers group (66% vs. 53%), 
but the difference did not achieve statistical significance 
(P 
¼ 
0.063). Fourteen of 50 habitual snorers (28%) and 
105 of 710 nonhabitual snorers (14.8%) had a body mass 
index above the 95th percentile adjusted for gender and 
age. The distribution of symptoms related to sleep-
disordered breathing is summarized in Table 2. Habitual

Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure values 
(average of three readings for each subject) did not differ 
between habitual snorers and nonhabitual snorers 
(P

blood pressures were 106.9 (10.6) mmHg in 
habitual snorers vs. 107 (12) mmHg in nonhabitual 
snorers. Mean diastolic blood pressures were 61.9 (7.6) 
mmHg vs. 61.8 (6.8) mmHg, respectively. 

The application of the general linear model revealed 
that effects of age, gender, and body mass index

DISCUSSION 

A number of case reports described cardiovascular 
complications of severe obstructive sleep-disordered 
breathing in pediatric patients, such as pulmonary hypertension 
and cor pulmonale.16,17 Decreased right ventricular 
ejection fraction and hypertrophy involving both

ventricles were documented in children with less severe 
sleep apnea-hypopnea by echocardiography and radio-
nuclide ventriculography.18–20 However, few pediatric 
reports addressed the possible correlation between systemic 
blood pressure and sleep-disordered breathing.7–11 

In the present study, we report morning blood pressure 
measurements and the absence of correlation of these 
measurements with habitual snoring in a population 
sample of children and adolescents attending randomly 
selected schools in the city of Larissa (central Greece). 
No difference was found in mean systolic and diastolic 
morning blood pressure between habitual and nonhabitual 
snorers. While age, gender, and body mass index were 
significant determinants of systolic blood pressure, and 
gender and body mass index were significant determinants 
of diastolic blood pressure, the presence of habitual 
snoring was not. The main strengths of this study are: 1) 
the inclusion of a large number of unselected nonhospitalreferred 
children; and 2) report of daytime (morning) 
blood pressure, which is one of the usual parameters used 
in adults for estimation of cardiovascular risk.21 

Blood pressure in childhood changes with growth, and 
normative blood pressure values are based on age, gender, 
and height.15 To compare blood pressure between children 
of different ages, genders, and body size, previous studies 
indexed measurements to the 95th percentile values.7,9,11 
Since there are no normative data for Greek children 
either by the auscultatory or oscillometric method, we 
chose to compare mean values of obtained blood pressure 
measurements between habitual snorers and nonhabitual 
snorers. In addition, we examined the effect of habitual 
snoring, age, gender, body mass index, and the interactions 
of previous parameters with habitual snoring on 
blood pressure by a general linear model analysis. This 
methodology of blood pressure comparison was also 
employed in a published pediatric study on the same 
subject.8 

Marcus et al. compared 41 children with obstructive 
sleep apnea-hypopnea (5 . 
3 years old) and 26 children 
with primary snoring (8 . 
4 years old).7 Indexed diastolic 
blood pressure was higher in children with obstructive 
sleep apnea-hypopnea than in those with primary 
snoring, both during sleep and during wakefulness. 
Similar results were found in a recent report including 
23 children with sleep-disordered breathing and adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy.9 

Kwok et al. performed the first study addressing the 
possible correlation between primary snoring in children 
and systemic blood pressure.8 Thirty subjects with primary 
snoring (9.5 . 
2.8 years old) and 30 healthy controls 
matched for age, gender, and body size (9.7 . 
2.7 years 
old) were studied. Significantly higher mean (nonindexed) 
systolic and diastolic daytime blood pressures were 
identified in the former group compared to the latter.8 
Presence of primary snoring, age, and body mass index 

Blood Pressure and Snoring 411 

were significant determinants of systolic blood pressure, 
while primary snoring and age were significant determinants 
of diastolic blood pressure. 

Amin et al. studied 39 children with obstructive sleep 
apnea and 21 subjects with primary snoring (5–17 years 
old) by polysomnography and 24-hr ambulatory blood 
pressure recording.11 Due to their different methodology, 
their findings are not directly comparable to the results 
of this investigation. Nevertheless, Amin et al.11 did not 
identify a significant difference in average systolic blood 
pressure during wakefulness or sleep or in average 
diastolic blood pressure during sleep between subjects 
with obstructive sleep apnea and primary snoring. 

In the only published series with a community-based 
sample of children (TuCASA study), 239 white and 
Hispanic preadolescent subjects (6–11 years old) underwent 
overnight unattended home polysomnography.10 
Blood pressure, sleep symptoms, and parental smoking 
status were recorded during the evening prior to polysomnography. 
The aim of the TuCASA study was to assess 
possible predictors of elevated blood pressure. Elevated 
systolic and diastolic pressure values were those above the 
90th percentile when adjusted for age, height, and gender. 
Mean (SD) systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 

98.4 (10.6) mmHg and 62 (8.9) mmHg, respectively; 
15 children had hypertension. Mean (SD) respiratory 
disturbance index (respiratory events/hr of sleep associated 
with 2% oxygen desaturation of hemoglobin) for the 
whole group of 239 children was 2.3 (3.8) episodes/hr. 
Significant univariate associations were noted between 
systolic blood pressure elevation and habitual loud 
snoring, witnessed apneas, respiratory disturbance index, 
poorer sleep efficiency, and between diastolic blood 
pressure elevation and obesity, poorer sleep efficiency, 
respiratory disturbance index, and arousal index.10 
Factors independently associated with both systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure elevation were poorer sleep 
efficiency and respiratory disturbance index. Obesity 
was independently associated only with diastolic blood 
pressure elevation. Therefore, in contrast to the present 
report, the TuCASA study documented an association 
between elevated blood pressure and sleep-disordered 
breathing in preadolescent children. 

Narrowing of the upper airway during sleep occurs at 
variable degrees within a population.22 We speculate that, 
overall, subjects who are referred for polysomnography 
have a more severe increase in upper airway resistance in 
comparison to snoring children from population samples. 
This could explain the presence of differences in mean 
systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure between children 
with snoring who are referred to the sleep laboratory and 
healthy controls, and the absence of such differences 
between habitual snorers and nonhabitual snorers in the 
general population. For example, in the study by Kwok 
et al.,8 both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 


412 Kaditis et al. 

higher by about 7 mmHg in children with primary snoring 
than in controls. 

The main limitation of the present study is that we did 
not perform polysomnography to diagnose sleep apneahypopnea 
vs. primary snoring. Nevertheless, it is likely 
that many of the studied subjects had primary snoring. 
Furthermore, parentally reported snoring is the most 
frequent symptom of obstructive sleep-disordered breathing, 
and its presence usually indicates a diagnosis of 
obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea, primary snoring, or 
upper airway resistance syndrome.12,23 However, its 
absence does not always exclude the possibility of one 
of the previous disorders. If some children with sleep-
disordered breathing were misclassified as nonsnorers in 
this report, then the misclassification will have attenuated 
possible blood pressure differences between the two study 
groups. 

Frequency of habitual snoring (more that 3 nights/ 
week) in this study was 6.6%, which is near the lower end 
of the 3.2–34.5% range described in the pediatric 
literature.24,25 It should be noted that a previous report 
including 3,680 Greek children (1–18 years old) from the 
same pediatric population reported a frequency of snoring 
every night of 4.2%.14 Finally, since only 50 participants 
were habitual snorers, the possibility of type II error (i.e., 
inadequate statistical power to detect an existing blood 
pressure difference between habitual and nonhabitual 
snorers) cannot be excluded. 

In conclusion, after studying a community sample of 
children, we did not identify increased morning systolic or 
diastolic blood pressure values in habitual snorers 
compared to nonhabitual snorers. Body mass index and 
gender, but not snoring, were significant predictors of 
blood pressure values. Based on our results and on the 
findings of previous pediatric reports, we speculate that 
there may be a correlation between blood pressure and 
severity of sleep-disordered breathing in children, but this 
association is not apparent when unselected snorers from 
the general population are studied. Snoring for more than 3 
nights per week reported by parents does not predict 
higher morning blood pressure values.
