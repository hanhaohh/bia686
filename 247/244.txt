ABSTRACT
Background 


Childhood 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
(OSA) 
is 
associated 
with 
neuropsychological 
deficits 
of 
memory, 
learning, 
and 
executive 
function. 
There 
is 
no 
evidence 
of 
neuronal 
brain 
injury 
in 
children 
with 
OSA. 
We 
hypothesized 
that 
childhood 
OSA 
is 
associated 
with 
neuropsychological 
performance 
dysfunction, 
and 
with 
neuronal 
metabolite 
alterations 
in 
the 
brain, 
indicative 
of 
neuronal 
injury 
in 
areas 
corresponding 
to 
neuropsychological 
function. 


Methods 
and 
Findings 


We 
conducted 
a 
cross-sectional 
study 
of 
31 
children 
(19 
with 
OSA 
and 
12 
healthy 
controls, 
aged 
6–16 
y) 
group-matched 
by 
age, 
ethnicity, 
gender, 
and 
socioeconomic 
status. 
Participants 
underwent 
polysomnography 
and 
neuropsychological 
assessments. 
Proton 
magnetic 
resonance 
spectroscopic 
imaging 
was 
performed 
on 
a 
subset 
of 
children 
with 
OSA 
and 
on 
matched 
controls. 
Neuropsychological 
test 
scores 
and 
mean 
neuronal 
metabolite 
ratios 
of 
target 
brain 
areas 
were 
compared. 


Relative 
to 
controls, 
children 
with 
severe 
OSA 
had 
significant 
deficits 
in 
IQ 
and 
executive 
functions 
(verbal 
working 
memory 
and 
verbal 
fluency). 
Children 
with 
OSA 
demonstrated 
decreases 
of 
the 
mean 
neuronal 
metabolite 
ratio 
N-acetyl 
aspartate/choline 
in 
the 
left 
hippocampus 
(controls: 
1.29, 
standard 
deviation 
[SD] 
0.21; 
OSA: 
0.91, 
SD 
0.05; 
p 
¼0.001) 
and 
right 
frontal 
cortex 
(controls: 
2.2, 
SD 
0.4; 
OSA: 
1.6, 
SD 
0.4; 
p 
¼0.03). 


Conclusions 


Childhood 
OSA 
is 
associated 
with 
deficits 
of 
IQ 
and 
executive 
function 
and 
also 
with 
possible 
neuronal 
injury 
in 
the 
hippocampus 
and 
frontal 
cortex. 
We 
speculate 
that 
untreated 
childhood 
OSA 
could 
permanently 
alter 
a 
developing 
child’s 
cognitive 
potential.

Childhood 
OSA 
and 
Neuronal 
Brain 
Injury 


Introduction 


Individuals 
require 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
cognitive 
skills 
in 
order 
to 
function 
in 
society, 
so 
if 
the 
acquisition 
of 
these 
skills 
is 
perturbed 
during 
development, 
there 
may 
be 
a 
long-term 
effect 
on 
cognitive 
and 
psychological 
function. 
Obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
(OSA)—defined 
as 
obstructed 
breathing 
efforts 
during 
sleep 
[1] 
with 
resultant 
gas 
exchange 
abnormalities 
and 
sleep 
fragmentation 
[2]—has 
been 
linked 
to 
increased 
cardiovascular 
mortality, 
increased 
automobile 
accidents, 
and 
cognitive 
function 
impairments 
in 
adults. 
Untreated 
childhood 
OSA 
enormously 
increases 
health 
resource 
utilization 
[3], 
and 
has 
been 
associated 
with 
growth 
problems, 
cardiovascular 
consequences, 
and 
neuropsychological 
dysfunctions 
such 
as 
learning 
and 
memory 
problems 
[4,5], 
decreased 
attention, 
and 
poor 
school 
performance 
[6]. 
From 
a 
cognitive 
standpoint, 
adult 
OSA 
has 
been 
linked 
to 
deficits 
of 
executive 
function 
(flexible 
adaptation 
to 
novel 
situations 
with 
an 
organized, 
goal-directed 
approach) 
[7]. 
In 
children, 
gains 
of 
executive 
function 
skills 
occur 
during 
developmental 
periods 
corresponding 
to 
the 
neuronal 
myelination 
and 
maturation 
of 
the 
prefrontal 
cortex 
[8,9]. 
Executive 
function 
is 
considered 
critical 
for 
school-age 
children 
to 
develop 
complex 
problem 
solving 
[10] 
and 
perform 
other 
volitional 
tasks 
in 
response 
to 
new 
situations 
with 
demands 
on 
working 
memory 
[11]. 
If 
untreated 
OSA 
causes 
neuropsychological 
or 
executive 
dysfunction 
in 
developing 
children, 
and 
if 
these 
skills 
are 
permanently 
impaired 
before 
maturation 
of 
the 
prefrontal 
cortex, 
it 
could 
severely 
alter 
a 
child’s 
cognitive 
potential, 
ultimately 
impacting 
both 
the 
child’s 
health 
and 
his 
or 
her 
functioning 
level 
in 
society. 


Symptomatic 
childhood 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
(SDB), 
which 
includes 
simple 
snoring 
and 
labored 
breathing, 
and 
partial 
obstructions 
that 
might 
not 
meet 
the 
adult 
criteria 
for 
OSA 
[12,13], 
has 
long 
been 
associated 
with 
behavioral 
dysfunctions 
including 
aggression, 
impulsivity, 
hyperactivity, 
and 
decreased 
attention 
based 
on 
subjective 
data 
provided 
by 
parents 
or 
teachers 
[14–21]. 
These 
behaviors 
mimic 
those 
associated 
with 
attention 
deficit 
hyperactivity 
disorder 
(ADHD), 
a 
disorder 
that 
presents 
with 
alterations 
in 
executive 
function 
[22]. 
Objective 
measurements 
of 
specific 
neuropsychological 
performance 
deficits 
related 
to 
sleep 
problems 
in 
children 
have 
been 
limited; 
however, 
recent 
studies 
have 
begun 
to 
identify 
significant 
differences 
in 
cognitive 
function 
between 
children 
with 
SDB 
and 
healthy 
controls. 
For 
example, 
Gottlieb 
and 
colleagues 
found 
significantly 
lower 
performance 
on 
measures 
of 
memory, 
executive 
function, 
and 
general 
intelligence 
in 
5-y-old 
children 
with 
symptoms 
of 
SDB 
than 
in 
asymptomatic 
children 
[23]. 
O’Brien 
et 
al. 
demonstrated 
decreased 
general 
intelligence, 
language, 
and 
visual–spatial 
skills 
in 
87 
habitually 
snoring 
children 
[24]. 
O’Brien’s 
group 
demonstrated 
even 
more 
significant 
neuropsychological 
deficits 
in 
children 
with 
more 
severe 
apnea 
[25]. 


The 
mechanisms 
causing 
these 
neuropsychological 
deficits 
have 
not 
been 
fully 
delineated. 
While 
sleepiness 
and 
sleep 
fragmentation 
might 
be 
readily 
reversible 
with 
treatment, 
neuronal 
injury 
resulting 
from 
long-term 
oxygen 
saturation 
abnormalities 
might 
represent 
a 
more 
pervasive 
health 
risk. 
There 
is 
evidence 
of 
altered 
brain 
function 
associated 
with 
blood 
gas 
abnormalities. 
Patients 
with 
sleep 
apnea 
have 
reduced 
cerebral 
blood 
flow 
and 
altered 
cerebrovascular 
responses 
to 
hypercapnia 
[26,27]. 
Hypoxia 
causes 
neuronal 


injury 
in 
vulnerable 
parts 
of 
the 
brain, 
especially 
the 
cerebellum 
and 
hippocampus, 
where 
the 
formation 
of 
lactate 
and 
free 
radicals 
is 
thought 
to 
lead 
to 
cellular 
injury 
[28,29]. 
The 
hippocampus 
is 
critically 
involved 
in 
learning 
and 
memory. 
Sleep 
deprivation 
in 
rats 
alters 
the 
synaptic 
plasticity 
of 
the 
hippocampus 
[30], 
and 
impairs 
hippocampus-
mediated 
contextual 
learning 
[31] 
and 
spatial 
learning 
[32]. 
Intermittent 
hypoxia 
also 
causes 
spatial 
learning 
deficits 
and 
increased 
motor 
activity 
in 
juvenile 
rats 
[33]. 
The 
mechanism 
proposed 
for 
the 
spatial 
learning 
deficits 
observed 
in 
rats 
involved 
apoptosis 
of 
subpopulations 
of 
hippocampal 
neurons 
[34]. 
The 
authors 
suggested 
that 
the 
behaviors 
demonstrated 
by 
rats 
exposed 
to 
intermittent 
hypoxia 
were 
similar 
to 
those 
demonstrated 
by 
children 
with 
sleep 
apnea. 


Imaging 
studies 
of 
adults 
with 
sleep 
apnea 
have 
identified 
abnormal 
morphology 
of 
the 
frontal 
cortex, 
cerebellum, 
and 
hippocampus 
[35,36]. 
Functioning 
in 
a 
complex 
integrated 
network, 
these 
brain 
areas 
are 
important 
for 
executive 
function, 
motor 
regulation 
of 
breathing 
[35,37], 
and 
memory 
function, 
respectively. 
Altered 
central 
nervous 
system 
metabolites 
of 
neuronal 
white 
and 
gray 
matter 
in 
OSA 
patients 
have 
been 
demonstrated 
using 
proton 
magnetic 
resonance 
spectroscopy 
imaging 
(MRSI). 
The 
authors 
suggested 
that 
hypoxemia 
resulting 
from 
sleep 
apnea 
might 
have 
caused 
cerebral 
neuronal 
injury. 
There 
is 
recent 
evidence 
that 
suggests 
a 
link 
between 
hippocampal 
metabolite 
alterations 
and 
deficits 
of 
cognitive 
function 
in 
adults 
with 
OSA 
[38]. 


These 
studies 
provide 
evidence 
that 
SDB 
is 
associated 
with 
observable 
reductions 
in 
cognitive 
function 
in 
both 
adults 
and 
children. 
In 
adults 
with 
sleep 
apnea, 
there 
are 
measurable 
morphological 
abnormalities 
in 
the 
brain, 
but 
adults 
with 
OSA 
often 
suffer 
from 
comorbid 
health 
problems 
such 
as 
diabetes 
[39], 
hypertension, 
and 
cardiovascular 
disease 
[40], 
which 
could 
confound 
the 
association. 
There 
have 
been 
no 
studies 
demonstrating 
such 
neuronal 
injury 
in 
children 
with 
sleep 
apnea. 
These 
studies 
are 
crucial, 
since 
childhood 
OSA 
impacts 
a 
rapidly 
developing 
brain, 
and 
thus 
the 
long-term 
consequences 
of 
neuronal 
injury 
may 
be 
far 
greater 
than 
those 
seen 
in 
adults. 


The 
purpose 
of 
this 
study 
was 
to 
examine 
the 
neuropsychological 
deficits 
associated 
with 
moderate 
to 
severe 
childhood 
sleep 
apnea, 
and 
to 
determine 
whether 
these 
deficits 
are 
associated 
with 
neuronal 
changes 
in 
vulnerable 
target 
areas 
of 
the 
brain. 
We 
hypothesized 
that 
SDB 
would 
be 
associated 
with 
neuropsychological 
dysfunction 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
executive 
function, 
learning, 
and 
memory; 
and 
that 
central 
nervous 
system 
metabolite 
alterations 
would 
be 
observed 
in 
brain 
regions 
associated 
with 
these 
functions, 
i.e., 
the 
hippo-
campus 
and 
frontal 
cortex.

8 
y 
signed

This 
was 
a 
cross-sectional 
study 
of 
participants 
aged 
6–16 
y 
with 
moderate 
to 
severe 
OSA 
compared 
to 
non-snoring 
healthy 
children 
group-matched 
by 
age, 
ethnicity, 
gender, 
and 
socioeconomic 
status 
(SES). 
OSA 
patients 
were 
identified 
by 
polysomnographic 
sleep 
studies 
performed 
at 
the 
Johns 
Hopkins 
sleep 
lab. 
All 
tests 
were 
performed 
while 
the 
OSA 
patients 
were 
awaiting 
surgical 
management. 
OSA 
participants 
met 
enrollment 
criteria 
if 
they 
had 
moderate 
to 
severe 
OSA 
by 
our 
definition, 
i.e., 
an 
apnea 
hypopnea 
index 
(AHI) 
 8 
(see 
‘‘Polysomnography’’ 
for 
definition 
of 
apnea). 
All 
participants 
underwent 
polysomnography 
and 
a 
battery 
of 
neuropsychological 
tests. 
Proton 
MRSI 
of 
the 
brain 
was 
performed 
on 
a 
subset 
of 
OSA 
participants 
and 
control 
children 
(those 
who 
met 
inclusion 
criteria 
and 
could 
tolerate 
imaging 
time 
without 
sedation). 


Recruitment. 
Normal 
healthy 
non-snoring 
participants 
had 
no 
known 
medical 
problems, 
and 
were 
recruited 
from 
inner-
city 
Baltimore 
by 
advertisements 
placed 
in 
the 
Johns 
Hopkins 
Hospital 
(downtown 
campus), 
in 
public 
sites 
in 
the 
inner 
city, 
and 
in 
a 
local 
African-American 
newspaper 
(since 
.70% 
of 
our 
clinic 
patients 
are 
African-American). 
For 
matching 
of 
SES, 
children 
were 
recruited 
from 
Baltimore 
City, 
with 
confirmation 
of 
zip 
code, 
maternal 
education 
level, 
and 
Hollingshead 
index. 
Hollingshead 
index 
is 
an 
index 
of 
SES 
based 
on 
parent 
education 
and 
type 
of 
job. 
Guardians 
of 
normal 
children 
were 
questioned 
by 
phone 
to 
determine 
eligibility 
for 
inclusion, 
with 
extensive 
questions 
about 
past 
medical 
history, 
medication 
use, 
and 
demographic 
information. 
At 
the 
time 
of 
the 
neuropsychological 
testing, 
questionnaires 
were 
used 
to 
verify 
history, 
medications, 
and 
demographic 
information.

was 
selected 
based 
on 
several 
criteria. 
The 
selected 
neuropsychological 
tests 
have 
been 
standardized 
and 
validated 
in 
this 
age 
range. 
Furthermore, 
there 
is 
a 
track 
record 
of 
success 
of 
brain 
imaging 
in 
children 
of 
this 
age 
range 
at 
our 
center, 
without 
the 
need 
for 
behavior 
training 
or 
sedation. 
Additionally, 
normal 
neuronal 
metabolite 
concentrations 
in 
the 
brain 
have 
been 
established 
for 
children 
in 
this 
age 
range 
[41–43]. 
Imaging 
studies 
in 
childhood 
OSA 
have 
not 
been 
performed 
previously, 
therefore 
we 
chose 
children 
with 
severe 
sleep 
apnea 
to 
more 
likely 
identify 
possible 
neuronal 
injury 
associated 
with 
OSA. 


Exclusionary 
criteria. 
Exclusionary 
criteria 
included 
a 
full 
scale 
IQ 
score 
 75 
on 
initial 
testing, 
neurological 
abnormalities 
revealed 
by 
history 
or 
radiological 
or 
electroencephalogram 
(EEG) 
studies, 
use 
of 
psychotropic 
or 
sedative 
medications 
for 
the 
last 
2 
wk 
before 
study, 
or 
non-English 
speakers 
because 
of 
the 
difficulty 
of 
performing 
neuropsychological 
tests 
through 
an 
interpreter. 
Children 
were 
also 
excluded 
if 
there 
was 
a 
history 
of 
significant 
medical, 
psychiatric, 
vision, 
or 
hearing 
impairment, 
or 
mental 
retardation. 
Children 
with 
life-threatening 
sleep 
apnea 
requiring 
emergency 
management 
were 
also 
excluded. 
Children 
with 
other 
sleep 
problems 
such 
as 
insomnia, 
parasomnias, 
bedtime 
behavior 
difficulties, 
restless 
legs 
syndrome, 
or 
abnormal 
movement 
during 
sleep 
were 
excluded. 
Children 
with 
sleep 
apnea 
who 
had 
a 
previous 
diagnosis 
or 
symptoms 
of 
ADHD 
or 
a 
history 
of 
chronic 
hyperactivity 
(n 
¼ 5) 
were 
not 
excluded 
because 
of 
the 
common 
overlap 
of 
these 
disorders 
with 
OSA; 
however, 
data 


analyses 
were 
performedbothwithand 
withoutthese 
children 
for 
comparison. 
Furthermore, 
the 
children 
with 
OSA 
and 
ADHD 
were 
assessed 
only 
while 
off 
psychotropic 
medication 
for 
more 
than 
2 
wk. 
All 
participants 
were 
screened 
to 
ensure 
that 
they 
had 
no 
contraindications 
for 
MRI, 
namely 
claustrophobia, 
cardiac 
pacemaker, 
orthodontics 
(braces), 
or 
other 
non–magnetic-resonance-compatible 
surgical/ferromagnetic 
implant. 
If 
contraindications 
were 
noted, 
children 
were 
allowed 
to 
proceed 
with 
neuropsychological 
testing 
but 
MRI 
was 
not 
performed. 
Normal 
control 
children 
were 
not 
excluded 
for 
ADHD 
if 
they 
otherwise 
met 
criteria 
(healthy, 
non-snoring, 
no 
other 
exclusion 
criteria 
or 
psychotropic 
medications). 
Control 
children 
with 
subsequent 
findings 
of 
AHI 
.1, 
or 
prolonged 
hypercapnia 
(.50 
mm 
Hg 
for 
.20% 
of 
total 
sleep 
time) 
measured 
by 
polysomnogrpahy 
were 
excluded, 
and 
there 
was 
no 
crossover 
to 
the 
OSA 
group. 


Polysomnography 


Polysomnography 
was 
performed 
on 
all 
participants. 
During 
the 
sleep 
study, 
surface 
electrodes 
and 
monitoring 
devices 
measured 
signals 
from 
central 
EEG, 
right 
and 
left 
electro-oculogram, 
surface 
EMG, 
ECG, 
chest 
and 
abdominal 
wall 
motion, 
and 
end-tidal 
PCO2 
(Novametrix, 
Wallingford, 
Connecticut, 
United 
States). 
Pulse 
oximetry 
with 
an 
8-s 
averaging 
time 
was 
used 
to 
record 
the 
time 
in 
minutes 
of 
any 
oxygen 
saturation 
less 
than 
95% 
to 
detect 
brief 
oxygen 
saturation 
changes 
(Masimo, 
Irvine, 
California, 
United 
States). 
Airflow 
was 
measured 
by 
oro-nasal 
thermistor 
in 
all 
children. 
Additionally, 
nasal 
pressure 
was 
monitored 
in 
order 
to 
obtain 
a 
more 
quantitative 
flow 
signal 
(Protech, 
Mukilteo, 
Washington, 
United 
States).Polysomnogram 
data 
were 
displayed 
digitally 
(Alice 
4, 
Atlanta, 
Georgia, 
United 
States). 
All 
studies 
were 
monitored 
with 
real-time 
video 
for 
motion 
analysis 
and 
snoring 
recording. 


Respiratory 
parameters 
of 
interest 
included 
arousals, 
apneas, 
and 
hypopneas, 
low 
oxygen 
saturation 
time 
(SaO2T), 
hypercapnia 
time, 
and 
oxygen 
saturation 
nadir 
(SaO2N). 
The 
arousal 
index 
(AI) 
was 
the 
number 
of 
arousals 
and 
awakenings 
measured 
by 
a 
shift 
of 
EEG 
signal 
to 
the 
alpha 
or 
beta 
range 
for 
greater 
than 
3 
s 
(as 
previously 
defined 
by 
the 
American 
Sleep 
Disorders 
Association 
[44]) 
divided 
by 
the 
total 
sleep 
time 
in 
hours. 
An 
apnea 
was 
defined 
as 
an 
absence 
of 
airflow 
for 
two 
or 
more 
breath 
cycles. 
Hypopnea 
was 
a 
visible 
decrease 
in 
airflow 
by 
nasal 
pressure 
signal 
(or 
by 
thermistor 
when 
pressure 
signal 
was 
unavailable) 
and 
either 
an 
EEG 
arousal 
or 
a 
drop 
in 
oxygen 
saturation 
of 
3% 
or 
greater. 
A 
mixed 
apnea 
was 
an 
obstructive 
apnea 
in 
combination 
with 
a 
central 
(absent 
effort) 
apnea. 
The 
AHI 
comprised 
the 
obstructive, 
mixed, 
and 
hypopnea 
events 
divided 
by 
total 
sleep 
time 
in 
hours; 
central 
apneas 
were 
not 
included 
in 
the 
AHI. 
SaO2T 
was 
the 
time 
(in 
minutes) 
with 
oxygen 
saturations 
less 
than 
95% 
(in 
order 
to 
detect 
mild 
intermittent 
desaturations), 
and 
SaO2N 
was 
the 
severity 
of 
oxygen 
desaturation. 
Hypercapnia 
time 
was 
the 
time 
in 
minutes 
that 
the 
end-tidal 
CO2 
monitor 
detected 
a 
CO2 
level 
greater 
than 
50 
mm 
Hg. 
There 
is 
no 
established 
definition 
of 
mild, 
moderate, 
or 
severe 
sleep 
apnea 
in 
children. 
OSA 
in 
adults 
is 
defined 
by 
the 
AHI: 
the 
number 
of 
apnea 
or 
hypopnea 
(partial 
obstruction) 
events 
per 
hour. 
However, 
continuous 
partial 
obstruction 
is 
underestimated 
by 
these 
criteria, 
and 
is 
considered 
significant 
by 
the 
Johns 
Hopkins 
Sleep 
Program.

[45–47]. 
For 
this

as 
AHI

OSA 
as 
AHI

Neuropsychological 
Evaluation 


The 
neuropsychological 
assessment 
was 
administered 
by 
a 
psychometrician 
(M. 
C. 
P.) 
supervised 
by 
a 
licensed 
psychologist 
(E. 
M. 
M.), 
both 
of 
whom 
were 
masked 
to 
the 
group 
assignment 
of 
the 
participants 
at 
the 
time 
of 
testing. 
The 
protocol 
was 
selected 
to 
include 
areas 
considered 
to 
be 
vulnerable 
in 
children 
with 
OSA—executive 
function 
and 
memory—as 
abnormalities 
of 
these 
brain 
systems 
may 
negatively 
impact 
psychosocial 
function 
and 
have 
been 
shown 
to 
be 
affected 
in 
adults 
with 
sleep 
apnea 
[48]. 
In 
addition, 
domains 
hypothesized 
to 
be 
less 
affected 
in 
children 
with 
OSA 
(visual–spatial 
perception 
and 
motor 
speed) 
were 
also 
included 
for 
comparison. 
Global 
intelligence 
was 
measured 
using 
the 
full 
scale 
IQ 
scores 
from 
WISC-III 
[49] 
(n 
¼ 15) 
or 
WISC-IV 
[50] 
(n 
¼ 16). 
In 
addition 
to 
IQ, 
the 
assessment 
protocol 
included 
measures 
of 
executive 
function 
(i.e., 
response 
preparation, 
inhibition, 
and 
working 
memory), 
attention, 
verbal 
and 
visual 
memory, 
neuromotor 
function, 
cerebellar 
function 
(i.e., 
perceptual 
and 
motor 
timing), 
and 
visual–spatial 
perception. 


Magnetic 
Resonance 
Spectroscopy 


Magnetic 
resonance 
spectroscopy 
detects 
steady 
state 
levels 
of 
native 
metabolites 
present 
in 
the 
brain. 
Among 
the 
brain 
compounds 
easily 
measured 
with 
magnetic 
resonance 
spectroscopy 
are 
N-acetyl 
aspartate 
(NAA), 
choline 
(Cho), 
and 
creatine 
(Cr, 
often 
used 
as 
a 
background 
comparison). 


Children 
were 
introduced 
to 
the 
MRI 
machine 
at 
the 
FM 
Kirby 
Center 
for 
Functional 
Brain 
Imaging 
by 
use 
of 
a 
full-
size 
mock 
scanner 
where 
the 
protocol 
and 
noise 
could 
be 
demonstrated 
ahead 
of 
time. 
The 
children 
were 
asked 
to 
lie 
still 
and 
they 
were 
supported 
with 
foam 
pillows 
to 
reduce 
movement. 
They 
were 
able 
to 
listen 
to 
music 
or 
watch 
movies 
with 
specially 
designed 
headphones 
and 
mirrors 
inside 
the 
actual 
scanner. 
No 
sedation 
was 
used 
in 
any 
study. 


Two 
different 
approaches 
were 
used 
for 
proton 
MRSI 
of 
the 
brain: 
multi-slice 
MRSI 
for 
coverage 
of 
supratentorial 
brain 
regions, 
and 
single 
voxel 
methods 
for 
the 
hippocampus 
and 
cerebellum. 
All 
magnetic 
resonance 
examinations 
were 
performed 
on 
a 
1.5 
Tesla 
clinical 
system 
(Philips 
Intera 
NT, 
Phillips 
Medical 
Systems, 
Best, 
Netherlands). 
Routine 
T1 
and 
T2 
weighted 
MRI 
sequences 
were 
used 
to 
screen 
and 
exclude 
for 
any 
structural 
abnormalities. 
Three 
oblique 
axial 
slices 
(thickness, 
15 
mm; 
intersectional 
gap, 
2.5 
mm) 
parallel 
to 
the 
anterior 
commissure–posterior 
commissure 
line 
were 
selected 
for 
the 
proton 
MRSI. 
Outer 
volume 
saturation 
pulses 
were 
used 
for 
suppression 
of 
lipid 
and 
water 
signals 
originating 
from 
the 
skull 
and 
scalp, 
and 
a 
chemical-shiftselective 
saturation 
pulse 
was 
used 
for 
water 
suppression. 
The 
three 
interleaved 
slices 
were 
recorded 
with 
a 
repetition 
time 
(TR) 
of 
1,700 
ms 
and 
an 
echo 
time 
(TE) 
of 
280 
ms 
(field 
of 
view, 
24 
3 
18 
cm; 
matrix 
size, 
32 
3 
24; 
signal 
average, 
1), 
giving 
a 
total 
of 
15 
min 
for 
data 
acquisition 
with 
circular 
k-space 
sampling. 
The 
nominal 
voxel 
size 
was 
0.8 
cm3. 
Spectra 
were 
evaluated 
from 
the 
following 
brain 
regions: 
putamen, 
thalamus 
(predominantly 
pulvinar 
region), 
dorsal 
parietal 
cortex, 
parietal 
white 
matter, 
frontal 
white 
matter, 
medial 


premotor 
cortex, 
and 
frontal 
cortex. 
In 
order 
to 
minimize 
partial 
volume 
effects, 
only 
voxels 
that 
appeared 
completely 
encompassed 
by 
the 
boundaries 
of 
the 
anatomic 
regions 
of 
interest 
were 
included. 
Single 
voxel 
methods 
utilized 
a 
PRESS 
sequence 
with 
a 
short 
echo 
time 
(TR/TE 
1,500/35 
ms) 
placed 
in 
the 
body 
of 
the 
left 
hippocampus 
and 
the 
mesial 
left 
cerebellum. 
Voxel 
size 
was 
2 
3 
1.5 
3 
1.5 
cm. 
For 
both 
spectroscopic 
methods, 
metabolites 
were 
expressed 
as 
ratios 
in 
comparison 
to 
levels 
of 
other 
metabolites, 
specifically, 
the 
NAA/Cr, 
Cho/Cr, 
and 
NAA/Cho 
ratios. 
This 
measurement 
method 
effectively 
detects 
metabolite 
changes 
that 
move 
in 
opposite 
directions 
such 
as 
the 
decreased 
NAA 
to 
increased 
Cho 
seen 
in 
ischemic 
brain 
injury 
[51] 
and 
in 
the 
injury 
reported 
in 
adult 
OSA 
[52]. 
Figure 
1 
shows 
an 
example 
of 
single 
voxel 
imaging 
of 
the 
hippocampus 
in 
a 
normal 
male 
child, 
with

outer 
volume 
suppression 
bands 
used 
to 
improve 
the 
accuracy 
of 
the 
hippocampal 
signal 
by 
suppressing 
surrounding 
lipid 
signal. 


Statistical 
Analysis 


Neuropsychological 
testing. 
For 
neuropsychological 
testing, 
the 
primary 
predictor 
variable 
was 
group 
status 
(control 
versus 
OSA 
measured 
by 
the 
AHI). 
Secondary 
predictor 
variables 
were 
other 
polysomnographic 
parameters 
(AI, 
SaO2T, 
SaO2N, 
and 
CO2 
. 
50) 
and 
body 
mass 
index 
(BMI). 
Primary 
outcomes 
were 
mean 
standard 
neuropsychological 
test 
scores. 
Levene’s 
test 
was 
used 
to 
ensure 
homogeneity 
of 
variance 
between 
groups. 
The 
Mann–Whitney 
U 
statistic 
for 
nonparametric 
analysis 
was 
used 
for 
all 
variables 
in 
which 
the 
Levene’s 
test 
was 
significant. 
Analysis 
of 
variance 
was 
used 
to 
determine 
differences 
in 
the 
outcomes 
assessed 
as 
a 
function 
of 
group 
status. 
T-tests 
were 
performed 
assuming 
equal 
variance, 
and 
the 
two-tailed 
significance 
is 
reported. 
Group 
differences 
were 
also 
compared 
by 
effect 
size, 
measured 
by 
eta 
squared 
(g 
2), 
a 
measure 
of 
contrast 
between 
groups 
independent 
of 
sample 
size 
[53]. 
According 
to 
Cohen 
[54], 
values 
of 
0.01, 
0.06, 
and 
0.14 
are 
used 
to 
indicate 
small, 
medium, 
and 
large 
associations 
between 
variables,

determined 
by

Sample 
size 
and

power. 
Previous 
reports 
of 
cognitive 
dysfunction 
in 
severe 
childhood 
OSA 
demonstrated 
significant 
effects 
when 
comparing 
healthy 
controls 
to 
as 
few 
as 
five 
OSA 
patients 
and 
nine 
snoring 
patients 
without 
OSA 
[55]. 
Power 
analysis 
was 
conducted 
to 
determine 
the 
appropriate 
sample 
size 
needed 
in 
each 
group 
in 
order 
to 
detect 
group 
differences 
between 
the 
sleep 
apnea 
patients 
and 
normal 
participants 
on 
mean 
neuropsychological 
test 
scores. 
Using 
the 
criteria 
of 
a 
power 
of 
0.80, 
a 
type

error 
rate 
of 
0.05, 
a 
mean 
test–retest 
reliability 
of 
selected 
instruments 
of 
0.80, 
and 
estimates 
of 
moderate 
to 
large 
effect 
size 
(i.e., 
g 
2 
. 
0.07), 
based 
on 
our 
preliminary 
data, 
it 
was 
determined 
that 
a 
sample 
size 
of 
13 
participants 
in 
each 
group 
would 
be 
adequate 
to 
detect 
group 
differences 
in 
neuropsychological

results 
between

patients 
and

were 
considered 
significant 
and 
interpreted 
further 
in 
our 
analyses 
to 
control 
for 
both 
type 
I 
and 
type 
II 
error. 
MRSI 
has 
not 
been 
previously 
performed 
in 
children 
with 
OSA; 
however, 
adults 
with 
OSA 
demonstrated 
differences 
in 
hippocampal 
metabolites 
with 
eight 
patients 
versus 
five 
controls 
[38]. 
Since 
this 
study 
represents 
the 
first 
MRSI 
in 
children 
with 
OSA, 
we 
performed 
brain 
imaging 
on 
all 
eligible 
children 
who 
could 
tolerate 
the 
procedure. 
Correction 
for 
multiple 
comparisons 
was 
not 
made, 
in 
order 
to 
gather 
data 
for 
future 
study. 
Results 


Demographics 


Thirty-four 
children 
were 
initially 
enrolled 
after 
screening 
for 
exclusionary 
criteria, 
but 
two 
did 
not 
return 
for 
testing, 


and 
one 
control 
was 
excluded 
after 
a 
finding 
of 
snoring 
and 
prolonged 
end-tidal 
CO2 
levels 
greater 
than 
50 
mm 
Hg 
(358 
min) 
despite 
a 
normal 
AHI 
and 
oxygen 
saturation. 
Demographic 
information 
for 
the 
entire 
eligible 
sample 
(n 
¼31) 
is 
listed 
in 
Table 
1. 
There 
were 
no 
significant 
group 
differences 
in 
SES, 
measured 
by 
median 
household 
income, 
or 
maternal 
education 
between 
groups. 
Additonally, 
the 
Hollingshead 
index, 
an 
index 
of 
SES 
based 
on 
parental 
education 
and 
job 
type, 
was 
not 
different 
between 
the 
groups. 
There 
were 
no 
significant 
differences 
between 
the 
two 
groups 
in 
age, 
gender 
ratio, 
handedness, 
or 
racial 
distribution 
(see 
Table 
1). 
Of 
the 
19 
OSA 
patients, 
five 
had 
a 
history 
of 
hyperactivity 
or 
diagnosis 
of 
ADHD, 
and 
analyses 
are 
presented 
separately 
for 
OSA 
and 
OSA 
excluding 
ADHD 
(‘‘OSA/not 
ADHD’’) 
groups. 
No 
normal 
children 
with 
ADHD 
answered 
the 
recruitment 
advertisements, 
therefore 
the 
control 
group 
does 
not 
include

Results 
of 
neuropsychological 
test 
performance 
for 
all 
groups 
are 
listed 
in 
Table

Children 
with 
OSA 
had 
significantly 
lower 
scores 
than 
matched 
controls 
on 
full 
scale 
IQ. 
The 
OSA 
group 
also 
had 
significantly 
lower 
performance 
on 
measures 
of 
executive 
function, 
including 
verbal 
working 
memory 
(sentence 
span) 
and 
word 
fluency 
(measured 
by 
the 
Delis-Kaplan 
Executive 
Function 
System 
(D-KEFS) 
category 
fluency 
test). 
In 
contrast, 
the 
executive 
functions 
reported 
to 
be 
impaired 
in 
adult 
sleep 
apnea 
[5,56,57] 
(i.e., 
problem 
solving 
and 
planning, 
inhibitory 
control, 
sustained 
attention, 
and 
vigilance) 
were 
not 
affected 
in 
children 
with 
severe 
sleep 
apnea. 
There 
were 
no 
significant 
differences 
between 
groups 
on 
any 
of 
the 
other 
neuropsychological 
variables;

studies 
of

were 
performed 
in 
a 
subset 
of 
children 
with 
OSA 
and 
controls. 
Children 
with 
ADHD 
were 
analyzed 
and 
reported 
separately 
(see 
Tables 
4 
and 
5; 
the 
OSA 
group 
excluding 
ADHD 
are 
labeled 
as 
‘‘OSA/ 
not 
ADHD’’ 
in 
the 
tables). 
Of 
the 
31 
eligible 
children 
successfully 
completing 
a 
polysomnogram, 
26 
underwent 
some 
or 
all 
of 
the 
brain 
imaging 
studies. 
Dropouts 
or 
exclusions 
from 
brain 
imaging 
included 
the 
following: 
one 
with 
metal 
dental 
work 
and 
four 
who 
could 
not 
tolerate 
the 
MRI 
(three 
obese 
children 
complained 
of 
claustrophobia). 
Regions 
of 
interest 
in 
the 
brain 
scan 
corresponded 
to 
areas 
hypothesized 
to 
be 
linked 
to 
neuropsychological 
deficits, 
including 
white 
and 
gray 
matter 
of 
the 
frontal 
and 
parietal 
lobes, 
assessed 
by 
MRSI, 
and 
the 
middle 
left 
hippocampus 
and 
cerebellum, 
assessed 
by 
the 
single 
voxel 
method. 
The 
total 
scan 
time 
was 
1 
h. 
The 
children 
were 
not 
sedated; 
therefore, 


some 
regions 
of 
interest 
were 
unable 
to 
be 
analyzed 
because 
of 
motion 
artifact 
(n 
varies 
depending 
on 
the 
image 
reported). 


Single 
voxel 
spectroscopy 
measurements 
of 
the 
body 
of 
the 
left 
hippocampus 
were 
analyzed 
in 
12 
children 
(six 
patients 
with 
OSA 
and 
six 
controls; 
see 
Figure 
1), 
and 
results 
are 
reported 
in 
Table 
4. 
Within 
this 
subsample, 
there 
were 
no 
significant 
differences 
between 
groups 
in 
age, 
maternal 
education, 
gender 
distribution 
(v 
2 
¼4.4, 
p 
¼0.08), 
handedness 
(v 
2 
¼0.1, 
p 
¼0.65), 
or 
race 
(v 
2 
¼0.02, 
p 
¼0.73). 
The 
group 
differences 
in 
neuropsychological 
test 
scores 
in 
this 
sub-
sample 
continued 
to 
show 
a 
large 
effect 
size. 
Compared 
to 
controls, 
the 
OSA 
group 
had 
a 
significant 
decrease 
in 
hippocampal 
NAA/Cho 
(p 
¼0.001) 
and 
a 
significant 
increase 
of 
Cho/Cr 
(p 
¼0.03), 
indicating 
abnormal 
neuronal 
metabolism 
in 
the 
static 
state. 


These 
differences 
remained 
when 
the 
subsample 
was 
analyzed 
excluding 
the 
child 
with 
ADHD 
from 
the 
OSA 
group. 
There 
was 
little 
overlap 
of 
results 
between 
the 
two 
groups 
in 
this 
subsample 
aged 
9–16 
y 
(see 
Figure 
2). 


Only 
two 
children 
under 
age 
9 
underwent 
single 
voxel 
MRSI 
of 
the 
hippocampus 
(one 
7-y-old 
in 
each 
group; 
the 
control 
was 
male 
and 
the 
OSA 
patient 
was 
female). 
The 
OSA 
patienthad 
an 
AHIof33.8, 
buther 
NAA/Cr 
ratio 
demonstrated 
an 
unusual 
value 
(2.16), 
more 
than 
twice 
that 
of 
all 
the 
other 
OSA 
patients, 
and 
significantly 
higher 
than 
that 
of 
all 
the 
normal 
children 
(range 
of 
NAA/Cr 
levels 
for 
all 
OSA 
and 
control 
participants: 
0.89–1.98). 
When 
results 
were 
compared 
including 
these 
younger 
children, 
the 
increased 
Cho/Cr 
in 
the 
OSA 
group 
remained 
significant 
(p 
¼0.05), 
while 
NAA/Cho 
was 
no 
longer 
significantly 
decreased 
because 
of 
the 
unusual 
value 
of 
NAA/Cr 
in 
the 
OSA 
patient 
driven 
by 
the 
increased 
NAA 
spectral 
peak 
(see

although 
given

Discussion 


To 
our 
knowledge, 
this 
is 
the 
first 
study 
utilizing 
MRSI 
to 
measure 
central 
nervous 
system 
metabolites 
in 
children 
with 
OSA, 
and 
to 
identify 
central 
nervous 
system 
changes 
associated 
with 
neuropsychological 
dysfunction 
in 
childhood 
OSA. 
This 
study 
demonstrated 
two 
primary 
findings: 
(A) 
neuronal 
metabolites 
in 
pediatric 
OSA 
patients 
were 
altered 
in 
the 
hippocampus 
and 
the 
right 
frontal 
cortex, 
indicating 
possible 
neuronal 
injury 
linked 
to 
severe 
childhood 
OSA, 
and 


(B) 
children 
with 
severe 
OSA 
had 
significantly 
lower 
IQ 
and 
executive 
control 
functions 
compared 
to 
normal 
children 
matched 
for 
age, 
gender, 
ethnicity, 
and 
SES. 
These 
cognitive 
functions 
depend 
on 
neuronal 
networks 
corresponding 
to 
the 
structures 
where 
we 
identified 
metabolite 
alterations. 


In 
the 
current 
study, 
children 
with 
sleep 
apnea 
and 
neuropsychological 
dysfunction 
demonstrated 
decreased 
levels 
of 
NAA/Cho 
in 
both 
the 
hippocampus 
and 
the 
right 
frontal 
cortex. 
The 
brain 
areas 
affected 
are 
important 
in 
IQ

and 
corroborate 
the 
findings 
from 
morphological 
studies 
of 
adult 
OSA 
showing 
decreased 
gray 
matter 
in 
the 
same 
regions 
[35,36]. 
While 
these 
findings 
do 
not 
necessarily 
indicate 
a 
causal 
relationship 
between 
OSA 
and 
neuronal 
abnormality 
(i.e., 
it 
is 
not 
known 
whether 
sleep 
apnea 
causes 
brain 
damage 
or 
pre-existing 
brain 
damage 
causes 
sleep

it 
will 
be 
important 
to 
determine 
to 
what 
extent 
these 
findings 
reverse 
with 
treatment. 
The 
NAA 
signal 
localizes 
predominantly 
to

system. 
Decreased 
NAA 
signal 
is 
notably 
seen 
in 
diseases 
with 
neuro-axonal 
loss 
or 
dysfunction 
[58,59], 
while 
increases 
in 
Cho 
occur 
in 
pathological 
conditions 
during 
active 
demyelination, 
as 
well 
as 
with 
changes 
of 
membrane 
metabolism 
or 
glial 
cell 
reaction 
[60,61]. 
Normal 
changes 
in 
Cho 
are 
also 
seen 
during 
myelin 
maturation 
in 
early 
development 
[41], 
but 
tend 
to 
be 
stable 
after 
age 
2 
y 
[43]. 
Previous 
animal 
studies 
of 
irreversible 
cerebral 
ischemia 
demonstrated 
decreased 
NAA 
signals 
by 
proton 
MRSI 
within 
minutes 
of 
injury, 
and 
these 
metabolite 
signals 
were 
detected 
prior 
to 
changes 
noted 
by 
typical 
magnetic 
resonance 
imaging 
[51]. 
NAA/Cho 
alterations 
are 
not 
necessarily 
permanent, 
as 
noted 
in 
studies 
of 
childhood 
encephalopathy 
or 
acute 
multiple 
sclerosis 
where 
reduced 
NAA/Cho 
improved 
after 
resolution 
of 
illness 
[62,63]. 
Therefore, 
dysfunction 
or 
acute 
injury 
to 
the 
axon 
can 
lead 
to 
decreased 
NAA 
prior 
to 
axonal 
loss. 
It 
is 
not 
clear, 
however, 
whether 
long-standing 
metabolite 
alterations 
are 
reversible, 
or 
whether 
there 
is 
a 
vulnerable 
age 
of 
neuronal 
plasticity 
that 
leads 
to 
permanent 
brain 
injury 
with 
neuronal 
metabolite 
alterations 
[64,65]. 


The 
laterality 
of 
our 
findings 
to 
the 
right 
frontal 
cortex 
is 
interesting, 
particularly 
given 
the 
neuropsychological 
findings 
involving 
verbal 
working 
memory 
and 
fluency, 
thought 
to 
lateralize 
to 
the 
left 
frontal 
cortex. 
Executive 
functions 
are 
supported 
by 
a 
distributed 
neural 
network 
with 
cortical 
and 
subcortical 
components 
including 
the 
frontal 
cortex 
and 
its 
striatal-thalamic-cerebellar 
connections 
[7,11,57,66]. 
Volumetric 
studies 
of 
adults 
with 
OSA 
demonstrate 
diffuse 
gray 
matter 
loss 
bilaterally 
in 
the 
frontal 
lobes, 
but 
those 
participants 
may 
have 
had 
long-standing 
OSA 
[35]; 
therefore, 
our 
finding 
in 
children 
may 
reflect 
changes 
earlier 
in 
the 
course 
of 
disease. 


The 
neuronal 
metabolite 
levels 
of 
NAA/Cho 
in 
the 
hippo-
campus 
were 
significantly 
reduced 
in 
children 
with 
OSA 
aged 
9–16 
y 
compared 
to 
controls, 
as 
demonstrated 
in 
Figure 
2, 
where 
there 
is 
virtually 
no 
overlap 
between 
the 
two 
groups. 
We 
identified 
a 
younger 
child 
(a 
7-y-old 
female 
with 
OSA) 
with 
unusually 
high 
NAA/Cr 
and 
NAA/Cho 
levels 
driven 
by 
a 
high 
NAA 
spectral 
peak. 
There 
are 
regional 
variations 
of 
NAA 
and 
Cho 
concentrations 
in 
the 
brain, 
and 
NAA/Cho 
levels 
are 
known 
to 
increase 
with 
age, 
especially 
between 
birth 
and 
age 
2 
y, 
but 
increases 
are 
subtle 
after 
age 
2, 
up 
to 
a 
peak 
at 
age 
10 
y 
[43]; 
therefore, 
the 
elevated 
NAA/Cho 
in 
the 
7-y-old 
OSA 
patient 
would 
not 
be 
an 
expected 
age-related 
change 
[41,43,67,68]. 
An 
increase 
in 
NAA 
is 
associated 
with 
increasing 
axon 
density, 
increased 
dendrites, 
and 
increased 
synaptic 
connections 
[41]. 
In 
rats 
exposed 
to 
intermittent 
hypoxia, 
apoptosis 
of 
hippocampal 
neurons 
correlating 
with 
spatial 
memory 
dysfunction 
was 
later 
reversed 
by 
neurogenesis, 
which 
is 
a 
unique 
capability 
of 
the 
hippocampus 
[33]. 
Additionally, 
gender-specific 
protection 
from 
brain 
injury 
in 
females 
[69] 
has 
been 
seen 
in 
experiments 
using 
intermittent 


hypoxia, 
which 
caused 
decreased 
branching 
dendrites 
in 
male 
but 
not 
female 
rats 
during 
development. 
The 
increased 
NAA 
spectral 
peak 
noted 
in 
the 
7-y-old 
female 
with 
OSA 
might 
be 
an 
outlier, 
or 
might 
represent 
neuronal 
recovery 
and 
neurogenesis 
in 
the 
damaged 
hippocampal 
neurons 
as 
seen 
in 
the 
animal 
studies. 
This 
finding 
requires 
validation 
with 
young 
participants 
in 
order 
to 
determine 
whether 
certain 
age 
groups 
or 
genders 
are 
more 
susceptible 
to 
neuronal 
injury 
or 
recovery. 


The 
findings 
of 
decreased 
IQ 
and 
altered 
executive 
function 
demonstrated 
by 
our 
study 
suggest 
that 
OSA 
can 
impact 
a 
child’s 
ability 
to 
learn 
and 
adapt 
to 
new 
challenges, 
or 
to 
perform 
in 
school. 
The 
participants 
in 
our 
study 
had 
severe 
sleep 
apnea. 
Although 
the 
prevalence 
of 
severe 
childhood 
sleep 
apnea 
is 
not 
known, 
17% 
of 
otherwise 
healthy 
children 
aged 
6–16 
y 
referred 
to 
our 
clinic 
from 
the 
local 
primary 
care 
providers 
for 
symptoms 
of 
SDB 
fall 
into 
this 
category. 
The 
neuropsychological 
deficits 
in 
this 
study 
of 
children 
with 
severe 
sleep 
apnea 
were 
more 
profound 
than 
those 
found 
in 
previous 
studies 
of 
mild 
OSA. 
However, 
these 
results 
corroborate 
the 
findings 
of 
several 
pediatric 
studies 
of 
cognition 
in 
childhood 
SDB, 
where 
deficits 
in 
general 
intelligence 
[23,25,55,70–73] 
and 
some 
measures 
of 
executive 
function 
[23,25,74] 
were 
noted. 
Compared 
to 
previous 
findings 
in 
adults 
with 
OSA, 
some 
executive 
functions 
(i.e., 
problem 
solving, 
planning, 
inhibitory 
control, 
and 
sustained 
attention) 
were 
not 
affected 
in 
children 
with 
severe 
sleep 
apnea 
[5,75]. 
Motor 
speed 
was 
also 
not 
affected 
in 
our 
sleep 
apnea 
patients. 


Unlike 
most 
other 
pediatric 
studies 
of 
neuropsychological 
deficits 
linked 
to 
mild 
or 
moderate 
SDB, 
we 
enrolled 
children 
with 
severe 
sleep 
apnea 
from 
a 
lower 
socioeconomic 
area 
with 
lower 
maternal 
education. 
The 
IQ 
levels 
were 
more 
profoundly 
impacted 
in 
our 
children 
with 
OSA 
compared 
to 
previous 
pediatric 
studies, 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
the 
Montgomery-Downs 
study 
of 
at-risk 
children 
[70], 
the 
O’Brien 
study 
of 
significant 
sleep 
apnea 
in 
children 
with 
a 
minority 
population 
of 
60% 
(mean 
AHI 
9.8) 
[25], 
and 
the 
Rhodes 
study 
of 
teenagers 
where 
the 
participants 
were 
morbidly 
obese 
[55]. 
These 
studies 
demonstrated 
that 
multiple 
risk 
factors 
may 
be 
additive 
in 
terms 
of 
neuropsychological 
consequences. 
In 
contrast 
to 
our 
study, 
the 
neuropsychological 
differences 
between 
apnea 
and 
control 
populations 
in 
the 
vast 
majority 
of 
pediatric 
studies 
may 
be 
underestimated 
because 
of 
enrollment 
of 
affluent 
populations 
with 
either 
high 
maternal 
education 
or 
high 
average 
IQ 
levels 
(conferring 
a 
possible 
protective 
effect 
on 
measurable 
neuropsychological 
deficits) 
[15,21,23,71,74,76], 
or 
because 
of 
design 
limitations 
such 
as 
the 
inclusion 
of 
children 
with 
snoring 
or 
mild 
OSA 
(AHI 
1–5) 
in 
the 
control 
group 
[23,55,76] 
or 
the 
lack 
of 
confirmation 
of 
normal 
breathing 
in 
control 
groups 
defined 
with 
a 
polysomnogram 
[15,21,73,74,77]. 


The 
OSA 
participants 
in 
our 
study 
were 
significantly 
more 
overweight 
or 
obese 
than 
the 
control 
participants. 
This 
study 
limitation 
reflects 
the 
reality 
of 
our 
referral 
population, 
in 
which 
more 
than 
40% 
of 
our 
general 
pediatric 
clinic 
patients 
are 
reported 
to 
be 
at 
risk 
for 
obesity. 
We 
were 
unable 
to 
recruit 
enough 
non-snoring 
obese 
controls 
to 
match 
for 
obesity, 
and 
snoring 
controls 
were 
excluded 
because 
of 
previous 
studies 
demonstrating 
that 
snoring 
is 
not 
normal 
[24].

Childhood 
OSA 
and 
Neuronal 
Brain 
Injury 


of 
childhood 
sleep 
apnea 
do 
not 
include 
information 
on 
the 
BMI 
of 
the 
children 
enrolled. 
Obesity 
is 
a 
risk 
factor 
for 
SDB 
and 
is 
a 
common 
finding 
in 
children 
referred 
to 
sleep 
centers 
[78]. 
Both 
SDB 
and 
obesity 
can 
affect 
quality 
of 
life 
[79,80]. 
If 
obesity 
and 
SDB 
interact, 
these 
combined 
problems 
as 
well 
as 
lifestyle 
factors 
linked 
with 
obesity 
(such 
as 
television 
time) 
may 
play 
an 
important 
role 
in 
exacerbating 
neuropsychological 
impairments 
associated 
with 
sleep 
apnea. 


We 
admitted 
into 
our 
study 
five 
children 
with 
OSA 
who 
had 
symptoms 
or 
a 
diagnosis 
of 
ADHD 
given 
the 
common 
overlap 
of 
sleep 
disturbances 
and 
daytime 
symptoms 
in 
children 
with 
ADHD 
and 
with 
OSA 
[81]. 
It 
is 
difficult 
to 
distinguish 
ADHD 
as 
a 
premorbid 
versus 
comorbid 
feature 
associated 
with 
sleep 
apnea. 
Likewise, 
many 
children 
seen 
in 
the 
clinic 
have 
symptoms 
of 
hyperactivity 
or 
ADHD 
but 
have 
not 
undergone 
formal 
diagnostic 
testing, 
therefore 
underestimating 
the 
prevalence 
of 
a 
comorbid 
disorder. 
It 
has 
been 
previously 
shown 
that 
executive 
functions 
are 
impaired 
in 
children 
with 
ADHD 
[82], 
especially 
notably 
in 
children 
with 
average 
or 
less 
than 
average 
IQ 
levels 
[83]. 
When 
children 
with 
ADHD 
were 
excluded 
from 
the 
OSA 
population, 
the 
significance 
of 
our 
findings 
did 
not 
change, 
indicating 
that 
they 
were 
not 
influencing 
our 
results. 


In 
clinical 
studies 
of 
OSA, 
it 
is 
difficult 
to 
differentiate 
the 
effects 
of 
sleep 
fragmentation 
from 
hypoxemia 
on 
neuropsychological 
function, 
since 
by 
definition 
the 
AHI 
encompasses 
both 
sleep 
fragmentation 
and 
oxygen 
saturation 
abnormalities. 
This 
study 
was 
not 
designed 
to 
separate 
these 
factors. 
Although 
the 
magnitude 
of 
the 
association 
of 
respiratory 
parameters 
to 
cognitive 
deficits 
was 
stronger 
than 
that 
of 
the 
AI, 
the 
AI 
might 
play 
a 
significant 
role 
in 
cognitive 
deficits 
with 
a 
larger 
sample. 
Several 
pediatric 
studies 
of 
snoring 
children 
without 
gas 
exchange 
abnormalities 
(often 
termed 
‘‘primary 
snoring’’) 
demonstrate 
effects 
on 
attention 
[24,71,72,74], 
IQ 
[23,24,71,72], 
or 
memory 
[23,72], 
indicating 
a 
possible 
role 
for 
sleep 
fragmentation 
or 
sleep 
disruption 
in 
neuropsychological 
dysfunction. 
The 
participants 
in 
our 
study 
were 
older, 
with 
more 
severe 
apnea, 
than 
the 
participants 
in 
studies 
of 
primary 
snoring, 
suggesting 
that 
age 
or 
severity 
of 
OSA 
may 
contribute 
to 
the 
relative 
neuropsychological 
impacts 
of 
sleep 
fragmentation 
versus 
oxygen 
deprivation 
injury. 
There 
may 
be 
a 
spectrum 
of 
SDB, 
from 
sleep 
fragmentation, 
to 
mild 
disease, 
to 
more 
severe 
disease. 
However, 
chronic 
sleep 
disruption 
during 
active 
brain 
development 
could 
potentially 
lead 
to 
permanent 
decreased 
cognitive 
potential, 
thus 
causing 
as 
serious 
a 
situation 
as 
oxygen 
deprivation 
to 
the 
brain. 


We 
were 
limited 
to 
the 
number 
of 
participants 
available 
in 
this 
study 
because 
of 
the 
expense 
of 
brain 
imaging. 
We 
acknowledge 
that 
some 
comparisons 
may 
have 
shown 
statistically 
significant 
group 
differences 
with 
larger 
samples, 
and 
effect 
sizes 
are 
reported 
to 
assist 
in 
the 
interpretation 
of 
effects 
for 
future 
research. 
For 
example, 
cerebellar 
neuronal 
abnormalities 
associated 
with 
childhood 
OSA 
and 
related 
neuropsychological 
dysfunction 
(e.g., 
perceptual 
timing) 
may 
indeed 
be 
observed 
in 
larger 
samples. 


Childhood 
OSA 
has 
a 
prevalence 
of 
about 
2% 
in 
the 
general 
population 
[84,85], 
and 
severe 
sleep 
apnea 
cases 
represent 
17% 
of 
the 
otherwise 
normal 
school-aged 
children 
referred 
to 
our 
sleep 
center. 
OSA 
in 
adults 
has 
been 
linked 
to 
increased 
cardiovascular 
morbidity 
and 
mortality, 
increased 
automobile 
accidents, 
and 
cognitive 
function 
impairments. 


We 
found 
that 
childhood 
OSA 
is 
associated 
with 
deficits 
of 
IQ 
and 
executive 
function 
and 
also 
with 
abnormal 
neuronal 
metabolites 
in 
the 
hippocampus 
and 
frontal 
cortex, 
indicating 
possible 
neuronal 
injury. 
We 
speculate 
that 
untreated 
childhood 
OSA 
could 
permanently 
alter 
the 
trajectory 
of 
a 
developing 
child’s 
ultimate 
cognitive 
potential, 
resulting 
in 
a 
lifetime 
of 
health 
and 
economic 
impacts. 
It 
remains 
to 
be 
determined 
if 
early 
identification 
and 
treatment 
can 
reverse 
the 
neuronal 
and 
performance 
deficits 
identified 
in 
this 
study 
of 
childhood 
OSA. 
Future 
studies 
will 
need 
to 
address 
the 
effect 
of 
treatment, 
and 
explore 
gender-and 
age-related 
differences 
in 
vulnerability 
to 
help 
target 
early 
diagnosis 
and 
treatment 
most 
effectively.
