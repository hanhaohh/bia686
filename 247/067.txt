ABSTRACT. Objective. To determine the utility of 
pulse oximetry for diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea 
(OSA) in children. 

Methods. We performed a cross-sectional study of 349 
patients referred to a pediatric sleep laboratory for possible 
OSA. A mixed/obstructive apnea/hypopnea index 
(MOAHI) greater than or equal to 1 on nocturnal polysomnography 
(PSG) defined OSA. A sleep laboratory 
physician read nocturnal oximetry trend and event 
graphs, blinded to clinical and polysomnographic results. 
Likelihood ratios were used to determine the 
change in probability of having OSA before and after 
oximetry results were known. 

Results. Of 349 patients, 210 (60%) had OSA as defined 
polysomnographically. Oximetry trend graphs 
were classified as positive for OSA in 93 and negative or 
inconclusive in 256 patients. Of the 93 oximetry results 
read as positive, PSG confirmed OSA in 90 patients. A 
positive oximetry trend graph had a likelihood ratio of 
19.4, increasing the probability of having OSA from 60% 
to 97%. The median MOAHI of children with a positive 
oximetry result was 16.4 (7.5, 30.2). The 3 false-positive 
oximetry results were all in the subgroup of 92 children 
who had diagnoses other than adenotonsillar hypertrophy 
that might have affected breathing during sleep. A 
negative or inconclusive oximetry result had a likelihood 
ratio of .58, decreasing the probability of having OSA 
from 60% to 47%. Interobserver reliability for oximetry 
readings was very good to excellent (k. 
.80). 

Conclusions. In the setting of a child suspected of 
having OSA, a positive nocturnal oximetry trend graph 
has at least a 97% positive predictive value. Oximetry 
could: 1) be the definitive diagnostic test for straightforward 
OSA attributable to adenotonsillar hypertrophy in 
children older than 12 months of age, or 2) quickly and 
inexpensively identify children with a history suggesting 
sleep-disordered breathing who would require PSG to 
elucidate the type and severity. A negative oximetry result 
cannot be used to rule out OSA. Pediatrics 2000;105:

bstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in children is a 
disorder of breathing during sleep characterized 
by upper airway obstruction that disturbs 
sleep and disrupts normal respiratory gas exchange.
1–3 Sequelae of OSA, including growth failure, 
cor pulmonale, and developmental delay, are 
thought to be attributable to sleep disturbance and 
repetitive hypoxemia.1,4,2 Ali et al5 estimated the 
prevalence of OSA in 4-to 5-year-old children at .7%, 
whereas 7% to 9% of children have simple snoring, a 
milder form of sleep-related upper-airway obstruction.
5–7 Usually, pediatric OSA is attributable to adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy. 

The most accurate and comprehensive method of 
diagnosing OSA is nocturnal polysomnography 
(PSG).3 Unfortunately, such testing is expensive and 
time-consuming. Thus, an abbreviated testing modality 
would be very helpful. We originally proposed 
that parental responses to questions about 
snoring, difficulty breathing during sleep, and observed 
obstructive apnea might distinguish normal 
children from those with OSA.8 However, several 
subsequent studies indicated that questionnaire responses 
could not reliably distinguish children with 
OSA from those with simple snoring.9–12 

Pediatric OSA sometimes, but not always, results 
in dips in hemoglobin saturation (Sao2). In adults 
being evaluated for OSA, apparently conflicting results 
on the usefulness of pulse oximetry have been 
reported.13,14 For adults with a low pretest probability 
of OSA, a negative oximetry result may be sufficient 
to exclude the diagnosis; for adults with a high pretest 
probability of OSA, a positive oximetry result 
may be sufficient to confirm the diagnosis of OSA.15 
The accuracy of nocturnal pulse oximetry compared 
with PSG for diagnosing pediatric OSA has not been 
evaluated. 

Since 1993, when patients were referred to our 
pediatric sleep laboratory, we have: 1) had the 
parents complete a questionnaire, 2) performed 
nocturnal PSG, and 3) printed the pulse oximetry 
trend and event graphics that summarize nocturnal 
oxygenation status.8,16,17 The purpose of the 
current report is to assess, from this large series of 
referrals to our pediatric sleep laboratory, the potential 
utility of nocturnal pulse oximetry for diagnosing 
pediatric OSA. A secondary aim was to

determine the accuracy of questionnaire data for 
diagnosing OSA. 

METHODS 

Study Design 

We conducted a cross-sectional study of all children referred to 
the sleep laboratory of the Montreal Children’s Hospital for evaluation 
of possible (OSA). Between January, 1993 and April 1998, 
there were a total of 552 patients evaluated. Of these, 349 were 
referred for nocturnal PSG to evaluate OSA, were between 6 
months and 18 years of age, and had complete data available. 
Subjects who had lung disease, neuromuscular disorders, diagnoses 
associated with central apnea or central hypoventilation, 
and those who were not specifically referred for possible OSA 
were excluded (Table 1). 

For each patient, data included a parental questionnaire, polysomnographic 
results, and simultaneously obtained pulse oximetry 
trend and event graphics. To define OSA for this study, we 
chose an objective measure, the polysomnographically determined 
mixed/obstructive apnea/hypopnea index (MOAHI) 
greater than or equal to 1 event per hour.3,18,19 Children with 
MOAHI values ,1 were considered to be normal or to have 
simple snoring.9 A sleep laboratory physician (R.T.B. or K.W.), 
blinded to both clinical information and polysomnographic results, 
read the oximetry graphs.16 Each oximetry was classified as 
negative, inconclusive, or positive and was compared with the 
polysomnographic diagnosis. 

Questionnaire and OSA Score 

Before polysomnographic testing, the parents of each subject 
completed a questionnaire.8 Questions included those about sleep, 
breathing during sleep, medical diagnoses, and previous surgery, 
including adenotonsillectomy. An additional question was added 
regarding degree of parental concern about breathing during 
sleep. From the questionnaire responses, our previously described 
OSA score was calculated using responses to 3 questions: 1) difficulty 
breathing during sleep, 2) obstructive apnea observed by 
parents, and 3) frequency of snoring during sleep.8 

PSG 

Overnight PSG was performed at home (7 channels) or in the 
sleep laboratory (14–21 channels). These home and laboratory 
recordings provide equivalent assessments of sleep/wakefulness, 
apnea/hypopnea indexes, and movement/arousals.17,20,21 At 
home, the cardiorespiratory recording consisted of electrocardiogram, 
pulse rate, Sao2, pulse wave form, and calibrated respiratory 
inductive plethysmography (thoracic, abdominal, and sum 
channels).17 In the laboratory, nocturnal 14-to 21-channel polysomnographic 
recordings included the home study channels plus 
5 channels for sleep staging: central and occipital electroencephalograms, 
right and left electrooculogram, and submental electro-

myogram. Oral/nasal airflow, transcutaneous oxygen, and end-
tidal carbon dioxide measurement were always included; 
intercostal, abdominal and arm electromyograms were sometimes 
included. Signals were acquired directly onto a computerized 
polysomnograph (Ultrasom, Nicolet, Madison, WI) in the sleep 
laboratory or transferred from a portable computer after the home 
studies. Computerized audiovisual recordings and analysis for 
sleep/wake and movement/arousals were used in both set


tings.17,20,21 

Polysomnographic outcomes included apnea, hypopnea, and 
desaturation indexes, total sleep time, and sleep efficiency—the 
percentage of time spent asleep from sleep onset until morning 
wakening.3 Sleep versus wakefulness was scored as previously 
described.20 Hemoglobin desaturation events were defined as a 4% 
or greater decrease in Sao2. Apnea was defined as an 80% or 
greater decrease in amplitude, for 1 or more breaths, on the 
respiratory inductive plethysmographic sum channel. Mixed and 
obstructive apneas were considered significant regardless of duration. 
Hypopnea was defined as a 50% to 80% decrease in the 
amplitude of the plethysmographic sum associated with a decrease 
in Sao2 of 4% or greater. The MOAHI and the hemoglobin 
desaturation index were calculated as the number of events per 
hour of sleep. 

Pulse Oximetry: Methods and Classification 

Sao2 was recorded during PSG using a Nellcor, N-200 pulse 
oximeter set to use 2-to 3-second averaging (mode 2). In the 
morning, trend and event graphics were printed (Fig 1).16 Trend 
graphs present 12-hour summaries of Sao2 and pulse rate. Event 
graphs present more detailed information on Sao2, pulse rate, and 
pulse amplitude. We have previously demonstrated the usefulness 
of event graphs to discriminate true hemoglobin desaturation 
from artifacts secondary to movement or a low pulse signal.16 In 
pediatric OSA, obstructive apneas and hypopneas occur more in 
rapid eye movement (REM) than non-rapid eye movement 
sleep20,22; desaturation events, therefore, cluster during REM sleep 
periods. For purposes of this study, a sleep laboratory physician 

(K.A.W. or R.T.B.) classified each oximetry as positive, negative, or 
inconclusive using the following definitions and criteria: 1) A 
desaturation was defined as a decrease in Sao2 of 4% or more; 2) 
A cluster of desaturations was defined as 5 or more desaturations 
occurring in a 10-to 30-minute period; 3) On the oximetry trend 
graphs, periods of relative tachycardia, usually 10 to 25 beats per 
minute, at the beginning and end of nocturnal pulse oximetry, and 
periods of relative tachycardia and increased heart rate variability 
exceeding 30 minutes were regarded as wakeful time and not 
considered; 4) Event graphs for Sao2 were used to distinguish true 
desaturations from movement artifacts and low signal amplitude 
artifacts using a method we have termed pulse amplitude modulation 
range16; 5) A positive oximetry trend graph had 3 or more 
desaturation clusters and at least 3 desaturations to ,90%19;6)A 
negative oximetry trend graph had no desaturation clusters and 
no desaturations to ,90%; and 7) An inconclusive oximetry trend 
graph was 1 that did not meet the criteria for positive or negative. 
Data Analysis 

Our objective was to determine the accuracy with which pulse 
oximetry graphs and the OSA score identify OSA. We used the 
likelihood ratio approach that indicates by how much a diagnostic 
test result will raise or lower the pretest probability of a target 
disorder.23,24 Pretest probability of having OSA was taken as the 
percentage of patients referred for OSA who were polysomnographically 
proven to have OSA. Likelihood ratios were used to 
calculate posttest probabilities of having OSA based on the OSA 
score (positive, negative, or inconclusive) and on pulse oximetry 
(positive or negative/inconclusive). The data were first analyzed 
for all patients and then subgroup analyses were performed for 
patients with and without diagnoses other than adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy that might have affected breathing during sleep. 

Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS and SigmaStat 
programs (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). For normally distributed data, 
results were expressed as the mean . 
standard deviation. For data 
that was not normally distributed, results were expressed as median 
(interquartile ranges).

Fig 1. These 4 Sao2 trend graphs are examples of 
negative, positive, and inconclusive interpretations. 
For simplicity, pulse rate trend graphs, 
which normally accompany the Sao2 trend graphs, 
have been omitted. A, this oximetry trend graph 
was interpreted as negative. The child had no evidence 
of OSA. Note that there is no evidence of 
saturation dips to ,90% and there are no clusters 
of desaturation. B and C, these 2 oximetry trend 
graphs were interpreted as positive based on clusters 
of desaturations and the fact that several de-
saturations decreased to ,90%. Both patients had 
polysomnographically diagnosed OSA. D, this 
oximetry trend graph was judged inconclusive. 
Note that there are several clusters of desaturation 
events, but only 1 single desaturation event to 

,90% Sao2. The patient did not have OSA based 
on PSG. 
Interobserver Reliability of Oximetry 

One hundred oximetries were selected randomly and independently 
classified as negative, positive, or inconclusive by 2 pediatric 
sleep laboratory technicians (A.M. and R.L.) and a sleep 
laboratory physician (R.T.B.). Thus, there were 3 sets of 100 possible 
agreements. The . 
statistic was used to estimate the level of 
agreement beyond that expected by chance.25 

RESULTS 

The study group of 349 subjects consisted of 218 
(62%) boys and 131 girls. Median age was 4.5 (2.9, 
7.1) years. There were 10 patients 6 to 11 months of 
age, 36 patients 12 to 23 months of age, 185 patients 
2 to 5 years of age, 75 patients 6 to 9 years of age, and 
43 patients 10 to 17 years of age. Ninety-two patients 
had medical diagnoses other than adenotonsillar hypertrophy 
that could have had an influence on 
breathing during sleep (Table 2).

of parental concern were more common in patients 
found to have OSA than in those found to have 
simple snoring or normal breathing during sleep 
(Table 3). However, these individual symptoms and 
the OSA score, which integrates several of these individual 
symptoms, were only moderately helpful in 
changing the diagnostic probability of OSA.8–12,26,27 
Likelihood ratios for OSA scores ,21 (predicted no 
OSA), 21 to 3.5 (inconclusive), and .3.5 (predicted 
to have OSA) were .617, .906, and 1.81, respectively 
(Table 3). Considering the pretest probability of having 
OSA as 60%, posttest probabilities were 44%, 
58%, and 73%, respectively (Fig 3A). 

Pulse Oximetry as an Abbreviated Testing Modality 

Interobserver agreements among the 3 readers for 
pulse oximetry classification as positive versus in-
conclusive/negative were 91%, 90%, and 85%. . 
analysis results showed that this level of agreement 
was excellent: .80 (95% confidence interval: .66-.88).25 

The pulse oximetry trend and events graphs were 
classified as positive in 93, negative in 95, and inconclusive 
in 161. Of 93 oximetries read as positive, PSG 
confirmed OSA in 90 patients; therefore, the positive 
predictive value of oximetry was 97% (90/93). The 
median MOAHI in subjects with a positive oximetry 
classification was 16.4 (7.5, 30.2; Fig 4). 

Test properties of pulse oximetry graphs for OSA 
are summarized in Table 4; inconclusive and negative 
pulse oximetry classifications were collapsed, as 
the results were similar. A positive pulse oximetry 
had a likelihood ratio of 19.4, which increased the 
probability of having OSA from 60% to 97% (Fig 3B). 
A negative or inconclusive pulse oximetry had a 
likelihood ratio of .58, which lowered the probability 
of having OSA from 60% to 47% (Fig 3B). 

According to our study design, 3 of 93 pulse oximetry 
readings were considered false-positive, ie, correlated 
with a MOAHI ,1 event per hour as documented 
by inlaboratory PSG. One 22-month-old 
child with asthma and adenotonsillar hypertrophy 
had a MOAHI of .6/hour. However, his PSG was 
read as compatible with mild OSA, based on paradoxical 
chest and abdominal movement present for 
11% of total sleep time, snoring, and obstructive 
hypopneas that were not associated with a 4% de-
saturation. One 15-month-old boy with sickle cell 
anemia had a desaturation index of 6.6/hour. De-
saturations occurred against a low baseline satura-

were not related to apneas or hypopneas. Another 
81/2-year-old boy was suspected of having Prader-
Willi syndrome, although cytogenetic testing was 
normal for the 15q11–13 deletion. Although his polysomnographic 
study revealed a high central apnea/ 
hypopnea index (20/hour), he had loud breathing 
and used accessory muscles of respiration suggesting 
a degree of airway obstruction. There was marked 
clinical and polysomnographic improvement after 
an adenotonsillectomy. 

Subgroup Analyses 

One hundred sixty-five of the 257 patients with 
only adenotonsillar hypertrophy to explain their 
sleep-disordered breathing had OSA (pretest probability: 
64%). In this group, oximetry had no false-
positive results and correctly identified 71 of 165 
patients with OSA. A positive oximetry result had a 
likelihood ratio of 43, giving a posttest probability of 
99% of having OSA. A negative or inconclusive 
oximetry result had a likelihood ratio of .576, giving 
a posttest probability of 58% of having OSA. 

Forty-five of the 92 patients with medical diagnoses 
other than adenotonsillar hypertrophy had 
OSA (pretest probability: 49%). In this group, oximetry 
had 3 false-positive results and correctly identified 
19 of 45 patients with OSA. A positive oximetry 
result had a likelihood ratio of 6.60, giving a posttest 

probability of 87% of having OSA. A negative or 
inconclusive oximetry result had a likelihood ratio of 
.618, giving a posttest probability of 39% of having 
OSA. 

DISCUSSION 

Among children who were referred to a pediatric 
sleep laboratory for possible OSA, a positive pulse 
oximetry result increased the probability of a patient 
having OSA from 60% to 97% (Fig 3B). Furthermore, 
the median MOAHI of patients with a positive pulse 
oximetry result was 16 events per hour and 90% of 
these patients had a MOAHI greater than 2.5 events 
per hour. A negative or inconclusive oximetry trend 
graph did not rule out OSA; indeed, referred children 
with negative pulse oximetry results had a 47% 
probability of having OSA on PSG (Fig 3B). Clearly, 
some children can have obstructive apneas without 
accompanying desaturations. The close relation between 
MOAHI and desaturation index suggests that 
pediatric OSA with desaturation events can be considered 
a more severe disorder than OSA without 
desaturations.28 

We report on the potential usefulness of pulse 
oximetry in a group of children at high risk for 
OSA, ie, those referred to a pediatric sleep laboratory 
for evaluation of this disorder. We took the 
pretest probability of OSA as 60%, the incidence of 
OSA in this series. Readers having children with a

based on the interpretations of oximetry trend and event graphs. 
Note that a positive oximetry interpretation corresponded to an 
elevated MOAHI in all but 3 cases. In the positive pulse oximetry 
group, 90% of patients had a MOAHI above 2.5 events/hour. The 
box plots show the median, 25th, and 75th percentiles; whiskers

different pretest probability of having OSA could 
use Fig 3B to calculate posttest probabilities given 
a positive oximetry result (likelihood ratio: 19.6) or 
a negative/inconclusive oximetry result (likelihood 
ratio: .58). 

Several groups have reported on the use of pulse 
oximetry for children having adenotonsillectomy. 
However, none of these groups have compared the 
diagnostic accuracy of pulse oximetry to nocturnal 
PSG, the accepted standard for diagnosis of OSA.3 
Van Someren et al29 reported that 15 of 44 children 
undergoing adenotonsillectomy had hypoxemia the 
night before the operation. Stradling et al30 studied 
61 snoring children who were having adenotonsillectomy 
primarily for recurrent tonsillitis; they found a 
decrease in the desaturation index from 3.6 to 1.5 
events per hour after the operation. Vavrina,31 using 
a computerized oximetry analysis, found that 25% of 
children undergoing tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy 
showed a characteristic pattern of repeated 
oxygen desaturations during sleep. 

Two studies have linked OSA, desaturation 
events, and sleep disturbance to daytime behavioral 
performance using psychometric testing or school 
performance. Ali et al32 found that sleep disturbance, 
daytime behavior, and vigilance improved after adenotonsillectomy 
in a group of children who averaged 
2.9 desaturation events per hour preoperatively. 
Gozal33 found that low-achieving first grade 

students with symptoms of OSA and a mean of 5 
desaturations per hour during sleep improved their 
school performance after having adenotonsillectomy. 
The median desaturation index and MOAHI 
of our positive pulse oximetry group were 3 to 5 
times greater than the desaturation index of the 
groups reported by Gozal and Ali, respectively. 
Thus, children identified by pulse oximetry testing 
are likely to have clinically significant disease severity. 


Pulse oximetry has been suggested in lieu of PSG 
for other patient populations. In children with myelomeningocele, 
Waters et al34 found that oximetry 
was useful for preliminary testing, detecting all cases 
of moderate to severe sleep-disordered breathing. 
However, their patients with a positive oximetry 
required PSG to clarify the type of sleep disordered 
breathing: central apnea, obstructive apnea, or central 
hypoventilation. In adults being tested for OSA, 
pulse oximetry has performed well for detecting individuals 
with severe OSA (high apnea/hypopnea 
indexes).35,36,13 However, Epstein and Dorlac14 found 
that pulse oximetry, as a screening test for adult 
OSA, was not cost-effective and misdiagnosed a significant 
number of patients with treatable sleep disorders. 
Adults too may have significant sleep disturbance 
from OSA without desaturation.37 

Care is required before nocturnal pulse oximetry is 
implemented as a testing modality for pediatric 
OSA. The accuracy of oximetry as an abbreviated test 
for OSA depends on the patient population, technician 
and physician experience, methodologic details, 
and oximeter brands. In this series, we were careful 
to exclude infants and patients who might have had 
central apnea, hypoventilation, and pulmonary and 
neuromuscular diseases that might have nonobstructive 
causes for hypoxemia. Too few patients ,1 year 
of age were evaluated to allow firm conclusions for 
young infants. For this study, sleep laboratory technicians 
applied the pulse oximeter probes either in 
the sleep laboratory or in the child’s home. In practice, 
parents would have to come to the hospital, 
learn to apply the oximeter, set it up at home, and 
return the machine after study completion. Since 
completion of this study, we have attempted home 
pulse oximetry in 33 children, 10 of whom were 
referred for possible OSA. In each case, a usable 
oximetry trend graph was obtained. 

Different brands of oximeters possess different 
performance properties. Averaging times and motion 
artifact rejection algorithms affect displayed 
Sao2 and vary across brands and even across modes 
in the same model. Because movement artifact can 
cause false decreases in saturation, any proposed

technique must be able to distinguish true desaturations 
from movement artifact.16 The most accurate 
method to distinguish true from false desaturations 
is to have the pulse wave form available; alternatively, 
a strong, stable pulse amplitude signal before 
and during desaturation events can be used.16 New 
oximeters are now available with the ability to read 
Sao2 even during motion such as that occurring at 
apnea termination.38 

How could pulse oximetry be used for pediatric 
OSA? Most children suspected of having OSA have 
adenotonsillar hypertrophy and sleep-related signs 
and symptoms of airway obstruction but are otherwise 
well. In this group, a positive oximetry trend 
graph increases the probability of having OSA to 
nearly 100%. For these children no additional testing 
should be needed before adenotonsillectomy. However, 
careful perioperative monitoring, including 
postoperative, inhospital observation is recommend


ed.39,40 

A negative or inconclusive oximetry result 
would require a subsequent PSG to definitively rule 
out OSA. 

Although a complete cost–benefit analysis is beyond 
the scope of this article, abbreviated testing 
with oximetry might be economical in certain circumstances. 
Equipment and supplies cost less for the 
simpler oximetry testing. In our experience, technician 
time is ,2 hours for oximetry versus at least 16 
hours for standard PSG. Physician interpretation 
time is similarly reduced. 

For those children with disorders other than adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy that might affect breathing 
during sleep, pulse oximetry could be used to 
quickly and inexpensively determine whether PSG is 
needed urgently to determine the type and severity 
of sleep-disordered breathing.41,42 Oximetry screening 
might also be particularly useful in geographical 
areas where pediatric PSG is not readily available. 
Pulse oximeters are widely available and easy to 
apply. We have found that reading graphical trend 
and event summaries is very fast (,2 minutes per 
study in the current series). 

Several studies have found that parental responses 
to questions about their child’s breathing during 
sleep are too inaccurate to rule in or rule out OSA.9 
The OSA score, which integrates responses to questions 
about snoring, difficulty breathing, and observed 
apneas, has not been able to accurately distinguish 
between children with OSA and those with 
simple snoring. The data summarized in Table 3 and 
Fig 3A do demonstrate, however, that children with 
a more dramatic history for OSA are more likely to 
have OSA than those who are less symptomatic.

INCOME INEQUALITY AND MORTALITY 

The observed associations in the United States at the state level between income 
inequality and mortality cannot be entirely or substantially explained as statistical 
artefacts of an underlying individual level relation between income and mortality. 
There remains an important association between income inequality and mortality 
at the state level over and above anything that could be accounted for by any 
statistical artefact. This result reinforces the need to consider a broad range of 
factors, including the social milieu, as fundamental determinants of health.
