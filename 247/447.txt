OBJECTIVE: 
To 
evaluate 
the 
relationship 
between 
quality 
of 
life 
and 
the 
relative 
severity 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
(SDB) 
and 
to 
compare 
changes 
in 
quality 
of 
life 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
in 
children 
with 
similar 
demographics 
but 
with 
either 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
syndrome 
(OSAS) 
or 
with 
milder 
forms 
of 
SDB. 
STUDY 
DESIGN 
AND 
SETTING: 
All 
study 
participants 
underwent 
polysomnography 
to 
document 
the 
severity 
of 
SDB. 
The 
effectiveness 
of 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
the 
relief 
of 
SDB 
was 
evaluated 
by 
using 
the 
OSA-18 
quality 
of 
life 
survey 
(OSA-18). 
Preoperative 
and 
postoperative 
OSA-18 
scores 
for 
each 
group 
of 
children 
(OSAS 
and 
mild 
SDB) 
were 
compared 
by 
using 
a 
repeated 
measures 
ANOVA. 
Changes 
between 
the 
2 
groups 
were 
compared 
by 
using 
an 
analysis 
of 
covariance 
with 
the 
preoperative 
score 
as 
a 
covariate. 
RESULTS: 
The 
study 
population 
included 
61 
children, 
43 
with 
OSAS 
and 
18 
with 
mild 
SDB. 
The 
demographics 
in 
the 
2 
groups 
were 
similar. 
The 
mean 
apnea-hypopnea 
index 
for 
children 
with 
OSAS 
was 
21 
(range, 
5-46), 
and 
for 
children 
with 
mild 
SDB, 
it 
was 
3 
(range 
0-4.9). 
The 
total 
OSA-18 
score 
and 
the 
scores 
for 
all 
domains 
showed 
significant 
improvement 
after 
surgery 
for 
both 
groups 
of 
children 
(P 
. 
.001). 
A 
comparison 
of 
mean 
difference 
in 
total 
and 
domain 
scores 
for 
the 
2 
groups 
of 
children 
was 
not 
significant. 
CONCLUSIONS 
AND 
SIGNIFICANCE: 
Preoperative 
values 
for 
the 
OSA-18 
total 
and 
domain 
scores 
are 
high 
in 
children 
with 
either 
OSAS 
or 
mild 
SDB. 
Both 
groups 
of 
children 
show 
a 
dramatic 
improvement 
in 
quality 
of 
life 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
and 
the 
degree 
of 
improvement 
is 
similar. 
Fortunately, 
surgical 
therapy 
with 
adenotonsillectomy 
is 
associated 
with 
marked 
improvement 
in 
quality 
of 
life 
for 
children 
with 
either 
OSAS 
or 
mild 
SDB.

S
S
leep-disordered 
breathing 
(SDB) 
in 
children 
ranges 
from 
mild 
airway 
obstruction 
to 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
syndrome 
(OSAS). 
Primary 
snoring 
is 
the 
principal 
symp


tom 
of 
mild 
SDB, 
whereas 
obstructive 
apnea 
and 
hypopnea 
characterize 
severe 
SDB. 
It 
is 
not 
always 
possible 
to 
distinguish 
OSAS 
from 
milder 
forms 
of 
obstruction 
solely 
on 
the basis of clinical criteria.1 Polysomnography is used to 
make 
the 
differential 
diagnosis 
in 
these 
instances 
by 
documenting 
the 
presence 
of 
snoring 
with 
or 
without 
apnea 
or 
hypopnea during sleep.2 Unfortunately, polysomnography 
is 
expensive 
and 
may 
not 
be 
available 
in 
all 
hospital 
facilities. 
As 
a 
consequence, 
many 
studies 
of 
the 
outcome 
of 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
SDB 
have 
not 
separated 
children 
with 
mild 
airway 
obstruction 
evidenced 
by 
primary 
snoring 
from 
those 
with 
OSAS. 
This 
practice 
has 
been 
justified 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
adenotonsillectomy 
is 
the 
recommended 
surgical 
therapy for both conditions.3 


In 
the 
present 
study, 
changes 
in 
quality 
of 
life 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
were 
evaluated 
in 
children 
with 
OSAS 
and 
in 
children 
with 
comparable 
demographics 
but 
milder 
forms 
of 
SDB. 
All 
children 
included 
in 
the 
study 
underwent 
polysomnography 
to 
establish 
the 
presence 
of 
SDB 
and 
its 
severity. 
The 
goals 
of 
the 
study 
were 
to 
evaluate 
the 
relationship 
between 
quality 
of 
life 
and 
the 
relative 
severity 
of 
SDB 
and 
to 
compare 
changes 
in 
quality 
of 
life 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
in 
children 
with 
similar 
demographics 
but 
with 
either 
OSAS 
or 
with 
milder 
forms 
of 
SDB.

was 
collected 
for 
both 
caregiver 
and 
child. 
Exclusion 
criteria 
included 
the 
following: 
(1) 
children 
younger 
than 
3 
or 
older 
than 
18 
years 
of 
age; 
(2) 
children 
who 
previously 
had 
had 
an 
adenotonsillectomy; 
and 
(3) 
children 
with 
craniofacial 
syndromes, 
neuromuscular 
disease, 
developmental 
delay, 
or 
mild 
psychiatric 
disorders. 


The 
effectiveness 
of 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
the 
relief 
of 
SDB 
was 
evaluated 
by 
using 
the 
OSA-18 
quality 
of 
life 
survey 
(OSA-18).4 The OSA-18 comprises 18 items in 5 domains of 
sleep 
disturbance, 
physical 
suffering, 
emotional 
distress, 
daytime 
problems, 
and 
caregiver 
concerns. 
The 
domains 
of 
emotional 
distress 
and 
daytime 
problems 
contain 
3 
items, 
whereas 
the 
other 
domains 
contain 
4. 
A 
point 
scale 
is 
used 
ranging 
from 
1(. 
none 
of 
the 
time) 
to 
7 
(. 
all 
of 
the 
time) 
to 
grade 
the 
relative 
severity 
of 
the 
problem 
addressed 
in 
each 
item. 
The 
total 
score 
and 
domain 
scores 
were 
recorded. 


All study participants underwent polysomnography5 to 
document 
the 
severity 
of 
SDB. 
The 
following 
parameters 
were 
measured: 
4-channel 
electroencephalography 
with 
bilateral 
central 
and 
occipital 
leads; 
electro-oculography 
to 
measure 
vertical 
and 
horizontal 
eye 
movements; 
electromyography 
with 
submental 
electrodes; 
electrocardiography; 
airflow 
recording 
through 
the 
nose 
and 
mouth 
by 
a 
nasal 
air 
pressure 
transducer 
with 
end 
tidal 
CO2; 
thoracic 
and 
abdominal 
effort 
by 
piezoelectric 
sensors; 
oxygen 
saturation 
through 
pulse 
oximetry; 
and 
tracheal 
sound 
recording 
by 
using 
a 
microphone 
secured 
to 
the 
neck. 
Digital 
videotaping 
with 
sound 
recording 
was 
performed 
throughout 
the 
night. 
A 
sleep 
medicine 
physician 
interpreted 
the 
PSG 
results. 
The 
apnea-hypopnea 
index 
(AHI), 
defined 
as 
the 
average 
number 
of 
obstructive 
apneas 
and 
hypopneas 
per 
hour 
of 
sleep, 
was 
used 
for 
diagnosis 
of 
OSAS. 
Obstructive 
apnea 
was 
defined 
as 
total 
absence 
of 
airflow 
through 
the 
mouth 
and 
nose 
with 
continued 
chest 
and 
abdominal 
movement 
for 
at 
least 
2 
respiratory 
cycles. 
Hypopneas 
were 
defined 
as 
a 
decrease 
in 
nasal 
flow 
with 
a 
corresponding 
decrease 
in 
SpO2 of  4% and/or with an arousal.2,5 OSAS was defined 
as 
an 
AHI 
of 
at 
least 
5 
or 
an 
apnea 
index 
(AI) 
of 
more 
than 


1. 
Children 
with 
an 
AHI 
of 
less 
than 
5 
and 
an 
AI 
of 
less 
than 
1 
were 
included 
in 
the 
study 
and 
considered 
to 
have 
mild 
SDB.6 
Caregivers 
were 
asked 
to 
complete 
the 
1st 
OSA-18 
survey 
before 
polysomnography. 
Children 
with 
SDB 
underwent 
a 
monopolar 
Bovie 
adenotonsillectomy. 
Caregivers 
for 
these 
children 
were 
asked 
to 
complete 
the 
OSA-18 
survey 
a 
2nd 
time 
within 
6 
months 
of 
surgery. 
Subtracting 
the 
mean 
postoperative 
score 
from 
the 
mean 
preoperative 
score 
derived 
the 
difference 
score. 
Because 
a 
decrease 
in 
mean 
score 
implies 
improvement, 
the 
mean 
change 
is 
a 
positive 
number. 
The 
95% 
confidence 
intervals 
(95% 
CI) 
for 
difference 
scores 
also 
were 
calculated. 
The 
standardized 
response 
mean 
(SRM), 
defined 
as 
the 
difference 
score 
divided 
by 
the 
standard 
deviation 
of 
the 
difference 
score, 
was 
used 
to 
estimate 
the 
extent 
of 
improvement 
after 
surgery. 
OSA-18 
total 
scores 
on 
the 
1st 
survey 
were 
classified 
as 
follows: 
mild 
(60), 
moderate 
(60, 
80), 
or 
severe 


(80).4 Preoperative and postoperative OSA-18 scores for 
each 
group 
of 
children 
(OSAS 
and 
mild 
SDB) 
were 
compared 
by 
using 
a 
repeated-measures 
ANOVA. 
Changes 
between 
the 
2 
groups 
were 
compared 
by 
using 
an 
analysis 
of 
covariance 
with 
the 
preoperative 
score 
as 
a 
covariate. 
SAS 
procedures 
(SAS 
Corp., 
Carey, 
NC) 
were 
used 
for 
statistical 
analyses. 
A 
power 
analysis 
indicated 
that 
a 
sample 
size 
of 
16 
is 
adequate 
to 
detect 
a 
20-point 
difference 
in 
OSA-18 
total 
score 
with 
80% 
power 
and 
. 
. 
.05. 
On 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
original study by Franco et al,4 a change in OSA-18 total 
score 
from 
80 
to 
60 
indicates 
a 
change 
from 
severe 
to 
moderate 
impact 
on 
quality 
of 
life. 
Therefore, 
the 
present 
study 
has 
sufficient 
power 
to 
detect 
a 
clinically 
important 
change 
in 
quality 
of 
life 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
OSA-18 
total 
score. 


RESULTS 


Sixty-nine 
children 
were 
included 
in 
the 
study. 
Four 
of 
these 
children 
were 
lost 
to 
follow-up, 
2 
others 
did 
not 
undergo 
surgical 
therapy, 
and 
the 
caregivers 
for 
2 
children 
did 
not 
complete 
the 
postoperative 
OSA-18 
survey. 
As 
a 
consequence, 
the 
study 
population 
included 
61 
children, 
43 
with 
OSAS 
and 
18 
children 
with 
mild 
SDB. 
The 
demographics 
in 
the 
2 
groups 
(OSAS 
and 
mild 
SDB) 
were 
similar 
and 
are 
presented in Table 1. The mean AHI for children with 
OSAS 
was 
21 
(range, 
5-46), 
and 
for 
children 
with 
mild 
SDB, 
it 
was 
3 
(range, 
0-4.9). 


OSA-18 
scores 
before 
and 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
children 
with 
OSAS 
and 
for 
children 
with 
mild 
SDB 
are 
presented in Table 2. The follow-up was short at 47.7 days 
in 
the 
OSAS 
group 
and 
50.4 
days 
in 
the 
mild 
SDB 
group. 
The 
total 
OSA-18 
score 
and 
the 
scores 
for 
all 
domains 
showed 
significant 
improvement 
after 
surgery 
for 
both 
groups 
of 
children 
(P 
. 
.001). 
The 
mean 
preoperative 
total 
and 
domain 
scores 
for 
children 
with 
OSAS 
generally 
were 
higher 
than 
for 
children 
with 
mild 
SDB. 
The 
exception 
was 
for 
the 
domain 
of 
daytime 
problems, 
in 
which 
the 
mean 
preoperative 
score 
was 
higher 
for 
children 
with 
mild 
SDB 
than 
for 
children 
with 
OSAS. 
These 
differences 
were 
not 
statistically 
significant. 
The 
mean 
total 
OSA-18 
scores 
before 
surgery 
were 
72.8 
(median, 
74.1) 
and 
69.4 
(median, 
69.7), 
and 
after 
surgery, 
they 
were 
41.0 
(median, 
30.1) 
and 


36.7 
(median, 
30.2) 
for 
children 
with 
OSAS 
and 
for 
children 
with 
mild 
SDB, 
respectively. 
The 
mean 
difference 
in 
total 
scores 
was 
31.8 
(SRM, 
1.0) 
and 
32.7 
(SRM, 
1.9) 
for 
children 
with 
OSAS 
and 
for 
children 
with 
mild 
SDB, 
respectively. 
The 
domain 
with 
the 
largest 
mean 
difference 
score 
was 
physical 
suffering, 
and 
the 
one 
with 
the 
smallest 
was 
for 
emotional 
distress. 
A 
comparison 
of 
mean 
difference 
in 
total 
and 
domain 
scores 
for 
the 
2 
groups 
of 
children 
was 
not 
significant. 


In 
the 
OSAS 
group, 
16 
children 
(37%) 
had 
a 
high 
OSA-18 
total 
score 
preoperatively 
(80), 
15 
(35%) 
had 
a 
moderate 
score 
(60, 
80), 
and 
12 
(28%) 
had 
a

The 
pattern

before

after

and 
there 
is 
an 
improvement 
in 
mean 
score 
for 
each 
domain. 
The

shows 
the 
least 
improvement. 
The

both 
in

DISCUSSION 


In 
the 
present 
study, 
preoperative 
values 
for 
the 
OSA-18 
total 
score 
and 
for 
most 
domain 
scores 
were 
higher 
for 
children 
with 


Table 
2 


OSAS 
than 
for 
children 
with 
mild 
SDB, 
but 
this 
difference 
was 
not 
significant. 
Improvements 
in 
quality 
of 
life 
measured 
by 
reductions 
in 
scores 
for 
the 
5 
domains 
of 
the 
OSA-18 
postoperatively 
are 
dramatic 
regardless 
of 
the 
severity 
of 
SDB. 
Caregivers 
of 
children 
with 
SDB 
report 
a 
significant 
improvement 
in 
quality 
of 
life 
after 
adenotonsillectomy, 
regardless 
of 
the 
severity 
of 
the 
underlying 
disorder. 


The 
domains 
with 
the 
highest 
preoperative 
scores 
and 
the 
biggest 
changes 
after 
surgery 
were 
physical 
suffering 
and 
caregiver 
concerns. 
The 
domain 
of 
physical 
suffering 
asks 
the 
caregivers 
to 
rate 
the 
frequency 
of 
snoring, 
restless 
sleep, 
and 
breath-holding 
spells 
at 
night 
in 
their 
child. 
The 
domain 
of 
caregiver 
concerns 
asks 
about 
the 
caregiver’s 
worry 
about, 
and 
frustrations 
with, 
the 
child. 
These 
factors 
are 
rated 
highly 
preoperatively 
in 
children 
with 
SDB 
regardless 
of 
severity 
and 
respond 
most 
significantly 
to 
surgical 
therapy. 
The 
domains 
of 
emotional 
distress 
and 
daytime 
problems 
had 
the 
lowest 
preoperative 
scores 
and 
the 
smallest 
change 
after 
surgery. 
The 
domain 
of 
emotional 
distress 
asks 
about 
mood 
swings, 
aggressive 
and 
hyperactive 
behaviors, 
and 
temper 
tantrums. 
The 
domain 
of 
daytime 
problems 
asks 
about 
excessive 
daytime 
sleepiness, 
poor 
concentration, 
and 
difficulty 
getting 
out 
of 
bed

in 
the 
morning. 
It 
is 
interesting 
that 
the 
domain 
of 
daytime 
problems 
was 
the 
only 
domain 
in 
which 
the 
mean 
score 
for 
the 
mild 
SDB 
group 
was 
higher 
than 
for 
the 
OSAS 
group. 
Again 
the 
improvements 
postoperatively 
appear 
independent 
of 
the 
severity 
of 
SDB. 


Preoperatively, 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
OSA-18 
total 
score, 
37% 
of 
children 
with 
OSAS 
and 
22% 
of 
children 
with 
mild 
SDB 
had 
values 
that 
were 
consistent 
with 
a 
high 
impact 
on 
health-
related 
quality 
of 
life. 
Postoperatively, 
in 
both 
groups, 
10% 
of 
children 
remained 
in 
the 
same 
group. 
Equally, 
90% 
of 
children 
with 
SDB 
improved 
their 
scores 
postoperatively 
regardless 
of 
the 
severity 
of 
SDB. 
It 
is 
clear 
that 
surgical 
therapy 
is 
associated 
with 
dramatic 
improvements 
in 
children’s 
quality 
of 
life 
even 
when 
the 
condition 
is 
mild. 


There 
is 
increasing 
evidence 
that 
mild 
airway 
obstruction 
evidenced 
by 
primary 
snoring 
is 
far 
from 
benign. 
Blunden 
et 
al7 showed that children with primary snoring had reduced 
neurocognitive 
performance 
compared 
with 
controls. 
This 
included 
deficits 
in 
attention, 
memory, 
and 
intelligence 
scores. Kennedy et al8 showed that children with primary 
snoring 
had 
reduced 
verbal 
and 
global 
IQ 
scores 
and 
reduced 
attention 
and 
memory 
compared 
with 
controls. 
O’Brien et al9 showed that children with primary snoring, in 
a 
sample 
of 
children 
from 
the 
community 
who 
did 
not 
seek 
medical 
intervention, 
had 
lowered 
neurocognitive 
function 
compared 
with 
nonsnoring 
children. 
These 
studies 
have 
not 
compared 
children 
with 
primary 
snoring 
with 
children 
with 
OSAS 
and 
have 
not 
shown 
that 
intervention 
with 
adenotonsillectomy 
leads 
to 
improvements 
in 
behavior. 
Nonetheless, 
they 
highlight 
the 
need 
for 
further 
studies 
in 
children 
with 
primary 
snoring 
and 
other 
forms 
of 
mild 
SDB. 
This 
is 
especially 
true 
because 
behavioral 
problems 
may 
be 
more 
prevalent in children with mild rather than severe OSAS.10 


In 
this 
study, 
mild 
SDB 
was 
defined 
as 
an 
AHI 
of 
less 
than 
5 
and 
an 
AI 
of 
less 
than 
1. 
The 
mean 
AHI 
for 
children 
with 
mild 
SDB 
was 
3. 
This 
includes 
children 
with 
primary 
snoring, 
upper airway resistance syndrome,11 and mild OSAS. We also 
studied 
children 
with 
a 
sleep 
disturbance 
that 
was 
symptomatic 
enough 
to 
request 
medical 
intervention. 
This 
may 
represent 
a 
selection 
bias. 
Caregivers 
of 
children 
who 
have 
persistent 
or 
worsening 
symptoms 
are 
more 
likely 
to 
seek 
surgical 
therapy, 
and 
these 
children 
may 
benefit 
to 
a 
greater 
extent 
than 
an 
equivalent 
community 
sample. 


There 
are 
a 
number 
of 
other 
limitations 
to 
this 
study. 
We 
did 
not 
have 
a 
control 
group. 
We 
therefore 
can 
conclude 
that 


surgical 
therapy 
for 
SDB 
is 
associated 
with 
an 
improvement 
in 
quality 
of 
life 
but 
cannot 
infer 
causality. 
There 
also 
are 
no 
long-term 
data 
to 
report. 
It 
is 
possible 
that 
improvements 
in 
quality 
of 
life 
are 
maintained 
in 
the 
long 
term 
in 
children 
with 
OSAS 
to 
a 
greater 
degree 
than 
in 
children 
with 
mild 
SDB.12-14 Finally, the small number of children in this study 
did 
not 
allow 
us 
to 
compare 
the 
improvements 
in 
quality 
of 
life 
in 
different 
age, 
ethnic, 
and 
body-mass 
index 
groups. 


In 
summary, 
preoperative 
values 
for 
the 
OSA-18 
total 
and 
domain 
scores 
are 
high 
in 
children 
with 
either 
OSAS 
or 
mild 
SDB. 
Both 
groups 
of 
children 
show 
a 
dramatic 
improvement 
in 
quality 
of 
life 
after 
adenotonsillectomy, 
and 
the 
degree 
of 
improvement 
is 
similar. 
This 
suggests 
that 
even 
mild 
forms 
of 
SDB 
evidenced 
by 
snoring 
but 
only 
isolated 
incidents 
of 
apnea 
or 
hypopnea 
have 
a 
decidedly 
negative 
effect 
on 
quality 
of 
life. 
It 
also 
raises 
the 
possibility 
that 
mild 
forms 
of 
SDB 
may 
have 
a significantly negative impact on child behavior.7-9 Fortunately, 
surgical 
therapy 
with 
adenotonsillectomy 
is 
associated 
with 
marked 
improvement 
in 
quality 
of 
life 
for 
children 
with 
either 
mild 
or 
severe 
SDB.
