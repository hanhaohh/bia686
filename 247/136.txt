SUMMARY 
The 
aim 
of 
the 
study 
was 
to 
determine 
whether 
in 
infants, 
the 
evaluation 
of 
thoracoabdominal 
movements 
alone, 
with 
no 
measurement 
of 
airflow, 
could 
be 
used 
to 
identify 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
events 
(OA). 
Two 
different 
methods 
were 
used: 
first, 
we 
initially 
quantified 
thoracoabdominal 
asynchrony. 
Although 
79.3% 
of 
OAs 
showed 
a 
significant 
increase 
of 
thoracoabdominal 
asynchrony, 
only 
10.9% 
of 
the 
events 
scored 
by 
the 
identification 
of 
phase 
opposition 
were 
true 
OAs. 
Next, 
we 
developed 
two 
artificial 
neural 
networks 
(ANNs) 
as 
classifiers 
for 
the 
study 
of 
the 
thoracoabdominal 
signals. 
The 
first 
network 
was 
trained 
to 
locate 
obstructive 
and 
central 
apnea 
events. 
It 
correctly 
detected 
75% 
of 
the 
OAs; 
however, 
only 
6.2% 
of 
the 
detected 
events 
were 
true 
OAs. 
When 
a 
second 
network 
was 
used, 
OAs 
could 
not 
be 
discriminated 
from 
other 
portions 
of 
the 
signals 
showing 
similar 
phase 
characteristics. 
It 
was 
concluded 
that 
the 
information 
available 
in 
uncalibrated 
signals 
of 
thoracic 
and 
abdominal 
respiratory 
movements 
was 
insufficient 
to 
unambiguously 
detect 
OA 
events 
in 
sleeping 
infants.

INTRODUCTION 


Airway 
obstructions 
in 
the 
form 
of 
obstructive 
(OA) 
or 
mixed 
sleep 
apnea 
events 
occur 
during 
sleep 
in 
infants 
(Kato 
et 
al. 
2000). 
Their 
clinical 
consequence 
is 
still 
unclear 
(Brouillette 
et 
al. 
1982; 
Kahn 
et 
al. 
1992; 
Kato 
et 
al. 
2000), 
but 
obstructive 
breathing 
episodes 
have 
been 
associated 
with 
cases 
of 
apparent 
life-threatening 
events 
and 
sudden 
infant 
death 
syndrome 
(SIDS) 
(Brouillette 
et 
al. 
1982; 
Kahn 
et 
al. 
1992; 
Kato 
et 
al. 
2000; 
Roberts 
et 
al. 
1985). 


In 
addition 
to 
thoracic 
and/or 
abdominal 
movements, 
the 
detection 
of 
OA 
requires 
information 
on 
respiratory 
airflow 
(American 
Thoracic 
Society 
Standards 
1996). 
Uncomfortable 
equipment 
such 
as 
masks, 
probes 
or 
thermistors, 
is 
used 
for 
the 
evaluation 
of 
air 
passage 
through 
the 
upper 
airways. 
Their 
use 
requires 
careful 
supervision 
because 
of 
frequent

movements 
during 
sleep. 
The 
measurement 
of 
airflow 
is 
therefore 
difficult 
to 
implement 
outside 
a 
sleep 
laboratory, 
such 
as 
in 
an 
infant’s 
home. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
respiratory 
movements 
are 
easily 
monitored 
with 
the 
use 
of 
sensor 
belts 
placed 
on 
the 
rib 
cage 
and/or 
the 
abdomen 
(Heldt 
1988; 
Milledge 
and 
Stott 
1977). 


Several 
studies 
have 
linked 
thoracoabdominal 
movement 
asynchrony 
with 
airflow 
obstruction 
in 
infants 
(Allen 
et 
al. 
1990; 
Corwin 
et 
al. 
1998; 
Sivan 
et 
al. 
1990; 
Staats 
et 
al. 
1984). 
Upper 
airway 
obstruction 
produces 
an 
increase 
in 
airway 
resistance, 
breathing 
effort 
and 
negative 
pleural 
pressure, 
resulting 
in 
inward 
movements 
of 
the 
rib 
cage 
and 
desynchronization 
between 
thoracic 
and 
abdominal 
movements. 
Yet 
thoracoabdominal 
asynchrony 
occurs 
independently 
of 
any 
airway 
obstruction 
in 
young 
subjects 
with 
compliant 
rib 
cages 
(Benameur 
et 
al. 
1993; 
Bryan 
and 
Gaultier 
1985; 
Hershenson 
et 
al. 
1990; 
Kohyama 
et 
al. 
2001). 


The 
aim 
of 
our 
study 
was 
to 
determine 
whether 
information 
obtained 
from 
uncalibrated 
thoracoabdominal 
respiratory 
movements 
alone, 
with 
no 
measurement 
of 
airflow, 
and

MATERIALS 
AND 
METHODS 


Infants 
studied 


Ten 
full-term 
infants 
with 
a 
median 
postnatal 
age 
of 
19 
weeks 
(range: 
6–115 
weeks) 
were 
studied. 
Their 
characteristics 
are 
described 
in 
Table 
1. 
The 
infants 
were 
referred 
to 
a 
pediatric 
sleep 
laboratory 
because 
of 
suspected 
OA 
during 
sleep. 
At 
the 
time 
of 
recording, 
all 
infants 
were 
in 
good 
health 
and 
receiving 
no 
medication. 
Informed 
consent 
was 
obtained 
from 
the 
parents 
and 
the 
hospital’s 
Ethical 
Committee 
approved 
the 
study. 


Sleep 
recordings 


Monitoring 
was 
carried 
out 
in 
a 
quiet 
and 
darkened 
room 
during 
the 
night 
from 
9.00 
pm 
until 
5.30 
am. 
All 
infants 
were 
recorded 
in 
the 
supine 
position 
with 
no 
restraint. 
A 
demand-
feeding 
schedule 
was 
followed. 
The 
infants 
were 
observed 
during 
recordings 
and 
their 
behaviors 
and 
nursing 
interventions 
were 
charted. 
The 
data 
were 
collected 
on 
a 
computerized 
sleep-recorder 
(Alice 
III, 
Healthdyne, 
Marietta, 
GA, 
USA). 
The 
following 
parameters 
were 
continuously 
recorded: 
electrooculogram 
(EOG), 
scalp 
electroencephalogram 
(EEG), 
electrocardiogram 
(ECG), 
thoracic 
respiratory 
movements 
by 
impedance 
pneumography 
and 
airflow 
by 
thermistors 
taped 
under 
each 
nostril 
and 
over 
the 
upper 
lip. 
Oxygen 
saturation 
was 
recorded 
continuously 
from 
a 
pulse 
oxymeter 
(Nellcor, 
Pleasanton, 
CA, 
USA), 
while 
gross 
body 
movements 
were 
detected 
by 
an 
actimeter 
taped 
to 
one 
hand. 
In 
addition, 
respiratory 
movements 
were 
measured 
by 
piezoelectric 
strain 
gauges 
contained 
in 
belts 
around 
the 
rib 
cage 
and 
the 
abdomen, 
at 
the 
level 
of 
the 
nipples 
and 
of 
the 
umbilicus, 
respectively. 
The 
respiratory 
signals 
were 
sampled 
at 
100 
Hz 
then 
filtered 
and 
stored 
at 
10 
Hz. 
This 
frequency 
ensures

sufficient 
accuracy 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
fastest 
breathing 
rates 
found 
in 
infancy 
(£1 
Hz) 
(Barnhart 
and 
Czervinske 
1995). 
The 
thoracic 
and 
abdominal 
signals 
were 
not 
calibrated. 


DATA 
ANALYSIS 


Sleep 
and 
apnea 
characteristics 


An 
experienced 
physician 
(J.G.) 
scored 
all 
recordings 
visually. 
Every 
30 
s 
period 
of 
the 
recordings 
was 
analyzed 
and 
categorized 
as 
either 
non-rapid 
eye 
movement 
sleep 
(NREM), 
rapid 
eye 
movement 
sleep 
(REM), 
indeterminate 
sleep, 
or 
wakefulness 
according 
to 
criteria 
recommended 
in 
the 
literature 
(Anders 
et 
al. 
1971). 
Indeterminate 
sleep 
was 
scored 
together 
with 
REM 
sleep. 
Sleep 
apnea 
was 
scored 
only 
if 
it 
lasted 
3 
s 
or 
more. 
Central 
apnea 
(CA) 
was 
scored 
when 
flat 
tracings 
were 
obtained 
simultaneously 
from 
the 
strain 
gauges 
and 
the 
thermistors. 
An 
OA 
was 
scored 
when 
continuous 
deflections 
were 
obtained 
from 
the 
strain 
gauges 
while 
a 
flat 
tracing 
was 
recorded 
from 
the 
thermistors. 
To 
avoid 
artifact 
scoring 
caused 
by 
thermistor 
displacements, 
OA 
preceded 
by 
a 
movement, 
a 
sigh 
or 
a 
cry 
was 
excluded. 
Mixed 
apnea 
was 
defined 
as 
a 
central 
apnea 
followed 
directly 
by 
an 
obstructive 
episode. 


Analysis 
of 
thoracoabdominal 
asynchrony 


A 
‘mirror 
index’ 
was 
defined 
to 
evaluate 
thoracoabdominal 
asynchrony. 
It 
was 
computed 
for 
each 
respiratory 
cycle 
limited 
by 
two 
successive 
maximums 
or 
minimums 
on 
the 
abdominal 
signal. 
The 
method 
is 
illustrated 
in 
Fig. 
1. 
The 
sum 
(S) 
of 
the 
thoracic 
and 
abdominal 
signals, 
respectively, 
divided 
by 
their 
amplitudes 
ATHO 
and 
AABD, 
was 
calculated 
during 
each 
breathing 
cycle. 
The 
area 
between 
the 
curve 
S 
and 
the 
line 
(d) 
connecting 
its 
ends 
was 
measured. 
This 
surface 
was 
maximal 
when 
the 
signals 
were 
in 
phase, 
i.e. 
when 
the 
thoracic 
and 
abdominal 
movements 
were 
synchronized 
(Fig. 
1A), 
and 
minimal 
when 
the 
signals 
showed 
phase 
opposition 
(Fig. 
1B). 
The 
mirror 
index 
was 
obtained 
by 
dividing 
the 
surface 
by 
the 
length 
of 
the 
period 
in 
order 
to 
obtain 
a 
range 
between 
0 
and 
1.

of 
the 
mirror 
index 
between 
the 
thoracic 
(THO) 
and 
abdominal 
(ABD) 
signals, 
for 
each 
respiratory 
cycle. 
ATHO 
and 
AABD 
are 
the 
amplitudes 
of 
each 
signal. 
The 
S 
signal 
is 
the 
normalized 
sum 
of 
THO 
and 
ABD. 
The 
mirror 
index 
represents 
the 
area 
between 
S 
and 
the 
linear 
trend 
(d), 
divided 
by 
the 
length 
of 
the

(L). 
The

is 
colored 
on 
the 
figure: 
(A) 
the 
signals 
THO 
and 
ABD 
are 
in 
phase, 
which 
implies 
a 
mirror 
index 
close 
to 
1; 
(B) 
the 
signals 
are 
symmetrical, 
which 
implies 
a

The 
sensitivity 
and 
specificity 
of 
the 
detection 
of 
OA 
with 
the 
use 
of 
thoracoabdominal 
asynchrony 
was 
evaluated. 
Six 
polysomnographic 
recordings 
(patients 
NA, 
DC, 
PM, 
CB, 
AC1, 
AC2 
in 
Table 
1) 
were 
analyzed. 
A 
total 
of 
140 
OA 
events 
occurred 
during 
45 
h 
of 
sleep. 
Sensitivity 
was 
evaluated 
by 
qualifying 
each 
apnea 
by 
the 
use 
of 
two 
criteria 
based 
on 
the 
study 
of 
the 
mirror 
index 
during 
and 
around 
the 
event: 
(1) 
the 
observation 
of 
a 
thoracoabdominal 
phase 
opposition 
during 
the 
apnea, 
defined 
by 
mirror 
indices 
decreasing 
below 
a 
threshold 
of 
0.15; 
(2) 
the 
observation 
of 
a 
significant 
increase 
in 
asynchrony 
during 
the 
apnea, 
allowing 
the 
event 
to 
be 
isolated 
from 
its 
context. 
The 
latter 
was 
quantified 
by 
a 
minimal 
decrease 
of 
50% 
of 
the 
mirror 
index 
inside 
the 
apnea 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
breathing 
pattern 
outside 
the 
apnea. 
Specificity 
was 
evaluated 
by 
listing 
the 
parts 
of 
the 
signals 
that 
showed 
at 
least 
one 
respiratory 
cycle 
with 
phase 
opposition, 


i.e. 
two 
mirror 
indices 
below 
0.15, 
indicating 
a 
significant 
increase 
in 
asynchrony 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
preceding 
respiratory 
cycles. 
They 
were 
classified 
in 
subgroups 
according 
to 
the 
event, 
which 
could 
be 
associated 
with 
phase 
opposition. 


Analysis

Artificial 
neural 
networks, 
with 
their 
parallel-distributed 
structure, 
show 
an 
ability 
to 
learn 
and 
to 
solve 
complex 
classification 
problems 
(Haykin 
1994; 
Hornik 
1991; 
White 
1989). 
Two 
ANNs, 
R1 
and 
R2, 
were 
built 
using 
a 
fully 
connected 
multiple 
layer 
perceptron 
architecture 
(with 
300 
hidden 
neurons

three 
output 
neurons) 
(Haykin

To

obstructive

episodes, 
as

The

of

it 
with 
film-like

of 
the

shifted

at 
the 
rate 
of 
10 
Hz. 
The 
output 
of 
the

was 
a

which 
equals 
0/1/2,

(Tables

Figure

illustrates 
the

To 
evaluate 
the 
performance 
of 
R1, 
five 
polysomnographic 
recordings 
independent 
of 
the 
training 
set 
(36.5 
h 
of 
sleep, 
including 
60 
OA 
events) 
were 
used 
(subjects 
NA, 
PM, 
CB, 
ME, 
AC3). 
The 
performance 
of 
R2 
was 
analyzed 
for 
three 
types 
of 
examples: 
OA 
characterized 
by 
a 
significant 
increase 
of 
asynchrony, 
OA 
within 
a 
context 
of 
thoracoabdominal 
phase 
opposition, 
and 
examples 
showing 
a 
significant 
increase 
of 
thoracoabdominal 
asynchrony 
without 
OA.

The 
classification 
of 
OA 
based 
on 
the 
criterion 
of 
thoracoabdominal 
asynchrony 
is 
shown 
in 
Fig. 
3. 
Among 
the 
140 
episodes 
of 
apnea, 
111 
(79.3%, 
i.e. 
70 
+ 
9.3%) 
showed 
a 
significant 
increase 
of 
asynchrony. 
Thirteen 
(9.3%) 
showed 
thoracoabdominal 
opposition 
but 
occurred 
in 
a 
context 
of 
a 
significant 
thoracoabdominal 
asynchrony 
and, 
on 
that 
account, 
could 
not 
be 
distinguished 
from 
the 
previous 
and 
following 
respiratory 
cycles. 
Eleven 
OA 
events 
(7.9%) 
showed 
artifacts, 
preventing 
the 
analysis 
of 
the 
asynchrony. 
Five 
OA 
episodes 
(3.5%) 
did 
not 
show 
any 
modification 
of 
thoracoabdominal 
asynchrony. 
The 
sensitivity 
of 
apnea 
detection 
from 
the 
direct 
observation 
of 
asynchrony 
equaled 
79.3%. 


During 
the 
evaluation 
of 
specificity, 
1019 
zones 
with 
one 
or 
more 
respiratory 
cycles 
in 
phase 
opposition 
were 
identified. 
They 
were 
classified 
in 
subgroups 
according 
to 
the 
event, 
which 
could 
be 
associated 
with 
phase 
opposition 
(Fig. 
4). 
Only 
111 
cases 
were 
effectively 
OA 
events, 
leading 
to 
a 
specificity 
of 
10.9%.

45 
(75%) 
were

as

11 
(18.3%) 
were 
classified 
as

and 
four 
(6.7%) 
were 
not

Among 
the 
four 
non-detected

one 
apnea 
showed 
no

one 
had 
a 
duration 
of 
3

and 
two 
were 
surrounded 
by 
a

of

Among 
the 
events 
classified 
as 
central

six 
showed 
a 
significant

in

and 
one 
was

False 
detections 
were 
observed 
when 
the

or 
was 
awake 
(42.5%), 
when 
the 
amplitude 
of 
the 
signals 
decreased 
or 
was 
close 
to 
zero, 
before 
an

and/or

or 
with

Several 
of 
these 
factors 
could 
be 
combined 
to 
describe 
the 
same 
event. 
The 
detection 
of 
OA 
events 
by

showed 
a

of 
75% 
and 
a

of 
6.2%.

The 
instability

the

that 
no 
classification 
was 
possible 
between 
an 
OA 
and 
a

and 
for

episodes 
immersed 
in 
a

In 
these

could 
not 
be 
discriminated 
but 
was 
also 
classified 
in 
the 
group 
showing

Finally, 
the

for

DISCUSSION 
Previous reports associated asynchrony of thoracic and 
abdominal respiratory movements with airway obstruction 
(Allen et al. 1990; Corwin et al. 1998; Kohyama et al. 2001; 
Sivan et al. 1990; Staats et al. 1984). Konno and Mead (1967) 
further demonstrated that during OA events, abdominal and 
thoracic volumetric variations show opposite algebraic signs 
and develop symmetrically. In the present study conducted in 
infants, obstructive sleep apnea events were not reliably 
identified by the use of uncalibrated thoracoabdominal 
respiratory signals. The finding derives from the direct 
observation of respiratory movements asynchrony, which 
provided good results in sensitivity but with a low specificity. 
The use of sophisticated and trained ANN systems that 
integrated information of phase, shape, frequency and amplitude 
did not decrease the number of false positive detections. 
In addition, a specific network demonstrated that OA events

could not be discriminated from other portions of the signals 
showing similar phase characteristics. The evaluation of the 
thoracoabdominal signals was therefore inadequate for the 
scoring of OA. 
Gross body movements accounted for about one-third of 
misclassifications of OA. This amount could be decreased by a 
systematic search for the time slices including movements. 
Other false positive detections were related to the presence of 
features common to both OA events and apnea-free respiratory 
signals. If significant thoracoabdominal asynchrony characterized 
most obstructive events, it was also associated with 
the muscular hypotonia of the rib cage found during active 
sleep. In the age range of the infants studied, active sleep 
represents 20–30% of total sleep time (Anders et al. 1971; 
Bryan and Gaultier 1985; Curzi-Dascalova and Plassart 1978; 
Stokes et al. 1992). It is also the stage of sleep where most OA 
events occur (Kahn et al. 1992). Some of the misclassifications 
caused by the increase in asynchrony could also be associated 
with increases in resistive load and partial airway closure 
(Guilleminault and Chowdhuri 2000), as well as with lower 
respiratory obstructions. These events were not evaluated in 
the present study. Their scoring as OA was, however, 
incorrect. In addition, several episodes of OA were followed 
by body or respiratory movements resynchronization. Postevent 
motion, however, was insufficient to unequivocally 
characterize OA. 
We must acknowledge some caveats in the study. First, the 
infants were highly selected and may not be representative of 
the general pediatric population. The subjects were studied 
because they exhibited frequent OA events. Second, the 
duration of OA was relatively short. It cannot be excluded 
that longer airway obstructions could have been identified 
more adequately. The duration of the episodes of OA studied, 
however, was representative of most apnea events seen in 
infants, whether healthy or victims of sudden infant death 
(Kahn et al. 1992). Finally, to deal with the conditions of 
home recordings in infants, the respiratory signals were not 
calibrated. Calibration by isovolume (Konno and Mead 1967) 
is not applicable to infants. Volumetric measurements necessary 
for some calibration procedures (Chadha et al. 1982) are 
difficult to implement at home. The qualitative diagnostic 
calibration method (Sackner et al. 1989) must be applied to a 
set of breaths with constant or quasi-constant tidal volume 
(De Groote et al. 2001), conditions not met in sleeping infants. 
In summary, it can be concluded that despite the use of a 
dedicated tool (mirror index) and one of the most powerful 
classification (ANN), OA events cannot be unambiguously 
detected without acquiring the airflow. This conclusion should 
be considered when planning sleep studies in infants, both in 
the laboratory and in the home environment.
