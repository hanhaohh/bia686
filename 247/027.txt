Abstract

Objective: To evaluate the effect of adenotonsillectomy on oxygen saturation measured through nocturnal pulse oximetry in children 
with sleep-disordered breathing. Methods: A pre- and post-intervention study was carried out using nocturnal pulse oximetry. The study 
involved 31 children who were suspected of having sleep-disordered breathing and had been referred for adenotonsillectomy. Results: A 
total of 27 children completed the study. The mean age was 5.2 ± 1.8 years, and 18 (66.7%) of them were male. Upon physical examination, 
23 (85.2%) of the children presented class III or class IV hyperplasia of the palatine tonsils. There was significant improvement in the post-
operative period over the pre-operative period in terms of the oxygen desaturation rate (OR = 0.65; 95% CI: 0.5–1.3 vs. OR = 1.63; 95% 
CI: 1.1–2.4; p < 0.001). Conclusion: Adenotonsillectomy significantly improved oxygen saturation, as measured through nocturnal pulse 
oximetry, in children with sleep-disordered breathing.

Introduction

The association between behavior/learning 
disorders and sleep disorders has been known for 
approximately 100 years.(1) In the last 30 years, several 
sleep-related diseases have been defined as a result 
of the monitoring of vital signs during sleep. Among 
those, sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) encompasses 
a wide spectrum of conditions presenting 
varying degrees of airway obstruction during sleep, 
ranging from primary snoring to partial or complete 
obstruction of the upper airways, known as obstructive 
sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS). In 
the general population, OSAHS is one of the most 
prevalent SDB conditions, affecting adults as well 
as children. However, OSAHS seams to be different 
in children than in adults in many aspects, especially 
those related to congenital, neurological, and 
anatomical changes.(2,3)

SDB conditions have an important effect on the 
quality of life of affected children. In a study evaluating 
61 children with OSAHS, diagnosed through 
the use of polysomnography, a standard quality of 
life questionnaire, known as the OSA-18, was used.(4) 
Based on this questionnaire, the authors found the 
impact of OSAHS to be minimal in 20 children (33%), 
moderate in 19 (31%), and considerable in 22 (36%). 
There was a significant correlation between OSA-18 
scores and the apnea-hypopnea index, even when 
adjusted for confounding factors in a multiple linear 
regression model (r = 0.5, p = 0.007). In 2003, 
another group of authors evaluated the impact of 
adenotonsillectomy using the same questionnaire 
in a cohort of 54 children. The size of the effect 
(mean of the standardized response) on the questionnaire 
score (before and after surgery) was 1.54 
(95% CI: 1.26–1.82), an effect equal to or greater 
than 0.8 being considered significant.(5)

Due to the positive response to the surgical treatment, 
together with the relative rarity of sleep studies 
in Brazil, children are diagnosed and submitted to 
surgery without a formal study. Therefore, the evaluation 
of the effect of this surgery on peripheral 
oxygen saturation, as measured by nocturnal pulse 
oximetry (NPO), during sleep in children with SDB 
is relevant.

Methods

In order to evaluate the effect of adenotonsillectomy 
in children with SDB, a before and after 
type cohort study was designed. The study sample 
was selected from among the children treated in the 
Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology and Pulmonology 
Outpatient Clinic of the Santo Antônio Children’s 
Hospital of the Santa Casa Hospital Complex in Porto 
Alegre, Brazil. All selected patients were candidates 
for tonsillectomy, with or without adenoidectomy 
(Chart 1), and had been referred for treatment by 
pediatricians of the Municipal Secretary of Health. 
The eligibility criteria of these candidates were 
checked by resident physicians who were unaware 
of the objective of the study. The inclusion criteria 
were being from two to ten years of age and having 
presented obstructive respiratory symptoms during 
sleep for at least three months. The exclusion criteria 
were as follows: presenting craniofacial, genetic or 
neurological abnormalities; suffering from asthma 
or other chronic pulmonary diseases; and having 
nasal polyposis. 

The objectives, risks and benefits of the study 
were explained to the parents and legal guardians. 
They were then asked to observe signs and symptoms 
in the children for a period of two weeks. 
Those who agreed to participate in the study gave 
written informed consent. The parents and guardians 
were then interviewed, and the children were 
examined. The size of the palatine tonsils seen in 
the nasal endoscopy was classified according to the 
criteria previously defined.(6) Pre-operative laboratory 
examinations (blood workup and coagulation 
profile) and electrocardiogram, as well as radio

logical studies of the nasopharynx and chest, were 
ordered.

The selected patients participated in the study by 
allowing themselves to be subjected to NPO during 
the night preceding the surgical treatment. For this 
study, an Ohmeda oximeter (model 3700®; Ohmeda, 
Boulder, CO, USA), which has a memory for up to 
eight hours of study, was used at a 12 sec sampling 
rate. If the child was suffering from an airway infection, 
the study and surgery were postponed. During 
the night, the room was monitored by two nurses. A 
previously trained medical student, under the supervision 
of the researcher, was responsible for prepping 
the patient and for giving instructions to the patient 
and to the parent/guardian regarding the examination. 
The sensor was attached to the finger of 
the patient, preferably the middle finger. For better 
fixation of the sensor, a splint was attached to the 
forearm with adhesive tape. Parents and guardians 
were instructed in the use of the equipment, so that 
they could turn it on or off in case the child had to 
go to the bathroom or upon ending of the examination, 
when the child woke up. The examination was 
considered valid if it continued for a period of at 
least four hours.(7)

The following variables were studied: total 
number of desaturations of = 4%; oxygen desaturation 
index (ODI), defined as the total number of 
desaturations of = 4% divided by the duration of 
the examination in hours; percentage of time during 
which saturation was lower than 95%; percentage of 
time during which saturation was lower than 90%; 
mean saturation; and minimum saturation. The 
oximetric data collected were analyzed in oximetric 
data and heart rate distribution tables created with 
the Excel® program and using a programmed algorithm 
to identify possible movement artifacts. All 
desaturations of = 4% were identified and noted. 
Heart rate was evaluated during the 36 sec prior to 
desaturation, and those presenting a pulse amplitude 
modulation range of = 40 were considered 
valid desaturations.(8)

All surgical procedures were performed in the 
morning and always by the same surgeon. After 
initiation of anesthesia, the nasopharynx was 
evaluated. Hyperplasia of the pharyngeal tonsils 
(adenoids) was verified and classified using a flexible 
fiberoptic laryngoscope (Machida, Tokyo, Japan) 
(Figure 1). After surgery, patients remained at least 
four hours in the anesthesia recovery room and were 
then sent to the infirmary. The volume of the palatine 
tonsils, obtained by determining the difference 
in liquid volume after their immersion in a graded 
flask containing a known volume of saline solution, 
was noted at the end of the procedure.

Unless there was some surgical complication, 
patients were discharged from the hospital on 
the day after the procedure. The interval between 
surgery and the post-operative NPO was at least four 
weeks. On the day of the post-operative oximetry, 
the questionnaire was again administered to the 
children. The oximetric variables were analyzed 
before and after surgery using the Student’s t-test 
or the Wilcoxon t-test, depending on the type of 
data distribution. In order to determine whether 
the pre-operative oximetry findings presented any 
associations with the anthropometric data or with 
the results of the physical examination, Spearman’s 
rank correlation coefficient (rs) was used. Data were 
tabulated and analyzed using the Excel® program 
and the SPSS program, version 11.0. The anthropometric 
data were analyzed using the Nutristat® 
program contained within the 2002® Epi Info™ 
package. The necessary sample size was estimated 
using the Student’s t-test to compare the difference 
between the mean pre-operative ODI and the mean 
postoperative ODI. For the calculation, a previous 
study was used with the same oximetry model 
used in a sample of patients with similar clinical 
characteristics.(9) The Samples® program contained 
within the PEPI® statistical package was used. An

mated. The minimum sample size calculated was 
21 patients with SDB. This study was approved by 
the Ethics in Research Committee of the Santa Casa 
Hospital of Porto Alegre.

Results

Of the 35 eligible patients, 8 were excluded for 
not being submitted to post-operative oximetry. 
Therefore, the final sample consisted of 27 patients, 
all of whom completed the study. The mean age was 
5.2 ± 1.8 years. Of those 27 patients, 18 were male 
(67.7%), and 22 were white (81.5%). Most parents 
and guardians had less than eight years of schooling 
(63%). The most common clinical complaints were 
snoring (100%), respiratory pauses during sleep 
(96.3%), nocturnal mouth breathing (96.3%), restless 
sleep (81.5%), and sialorrhea (74.1%) (Table 1). 
Most patients presented class III or class IV pharyngeal 
and palatine tonsil hyperplasia (96.3% and 
85.2%, respectively) (Table 2). There were 6 children 
(22.2%; 3 males and 3 females) who were under the 
25th percentile in terms of weight-for-age, and there 
were 3 (25.9%; 2 males and 1 female) were over the 
75th percentile.

There were no intra-operative or post-operative 
complications. The mean surgical time was 42.9 ± 
13.8 min. The average palatine tonsil volume was 
10.18 ± 3.11 mL, ranging between 5 mL and 18 mL. 
The oximetric study results are described in Table 3. 
The mean interval between surgery and the postoperative 
NPOs was 281.9 days. All patients reported 
symptom improvement after surgery, except for 
2 cases in which snoring persisted. One of those 
2 patients also continued to present significant 
desaturations during the postoperative period 
(ODI = 4.5).

There was a significant difference between pre-
operative ODI and post-operative ODI (p < 0.001), 
as well as between pre-operative and post-operative 
total number of desaturations, percentage of 
saturation time lower than 95%, and percentage of 
saturation time lower than 90% (p < 0.001) (Table 3). 
We found no differences between the pre-operative 
and post-operative values for examination time, 
mean saturation, mean minimum values, and mean 
maximum values. The ODI was not found to correlate 
significantly with age or weight (p = 0.526 and 
p = 0.496, respectively), nor with the degree of 
hyperplasia observed in the pharyngeal and palatine 
tonsils (p = 0.427 and p = 0.851, respectively).

Discussion

In this study there was a clear improvement 
in the principal post-operative oximetric variables 
in all but one of the patients studied. Prior to 
surgery, this patient presented class III and class IV 
hyperplasia of the pharyngeal and palatine tonsils, 
respectively. Considering the significant clinical 
symptom improvement, as well as the improved 
oximetry findings, in children submitted to surgical 
treatment, it is important to emphasize that there 
was only a weak correlation between pre-operative 
ODI and the degree of hyperplasia of the pharyngeal 
and palatine tonsils, which, in daily practice, is 
an important finding to indicate surgical treatment. 
This finding is similar to those of other studies.(10-12) 
However, it is important to correlate the tonsil 
volume with the size of the pharyngeal space. In

a narrow pharynx, even small tonsils can cause 
significant airway obstruction. In adults, OSAHS 
seams to have a multifactorial origin: genetic and 
neuromuscular factors can play important roles. In 
children, factors other than the volumetric increase 
in Waldeyer’s lymphoid ring can be involved.(13)

In the pediatric population, the estimated prevalence 
of primary snoring ranges from 3.2% to 12.1%, 
compared with 0.7% to 10.3% for OSAHS.(10) In children 
with SDB, the prevalence of OSAHS, diagnosed 
through polysomnography, has been reported to be 
as high as 70%.(14-17) Although polysomnography is 
considered the gold standard in the investigation 
of SDB, NPO is an interesting investigative option 
due to its low cost and wide availability. However, 
the sensitivity of NPO is low when compared with 
that of polysomnography. In a transversal study, 
349 children were submitted to evaluation for SDB. 
The authors showed that a positive NPO has a positive 
predictive value of 97%. However, a negative 
or inconclusive NPO has a negative predictive value 
of only 57%.(14) If we use the cut-off value established 
by these authors, which is the same as that 
recommended by the American Thoracic Society (an 
ODI equal to or greater than 3), we can see that 
5 (18.5%) of the children evaluated in our study 
presented abnormal desaturations based on the 
NPO results.(18) This proportion is lower than those 
found in similar studies, in which the proportion of 
children with SDB found to present OSAHS ranged 
from 46% to 70%.

One hypothesis that could explain the low 
proportion of children with more than three desaturations 
is that an oximeter that provides an oximetric 
average over a prolonged period of time underestimates 
the number of short episodes of desaturation 
in children with OSAHS.(19) In this study, the oximeter 
was used in eight-hour memory mode. In this mode, 
the equipment calculates the average every 12 sec. 
The problem of the sampling rate in the memory of 
the device has been highlighted by other authors, 
who carried out a study involving 16 adult patients 
with SDB and the simultaneous use of two oximeters 
with different sampling rates. In that study, the 
oximeter set to use a 12-sec sampling rate registered 
a mean ODI of 3.2 (range, 1 to 18.3), while the other 
(set to a 2-sec sampling rate) registered a mean ODI 
of 8.34 (range, 2 to 22.8) (rs = 0.69, p < 0.001).(20) 
Another possibility for the low frequency may be 
the fact that we have included in the sample children 
with indication of tonsillectomy for repeated 
tonsillitis, even though snoring is one of the selection 
criteria. However, despite the above-mentioned 
limitations of NPO, this examination can still be 
useful if we take into account its high specificity, its 
wide availability, and the limited availability of sleep 
laboratory polysomnography for pediatric patients.

There is still no consensus on when surgical treatment 
is indicated in children with SDB. Most authors 
agree that children with severe OSAHS should receive 
immediate treatment due to the potential risks of 
cardiopulmonary complications. On the other hand, 
the appropriate treatment for children with borderline 
or moderate forms of the disease is still under 
debate, principally because little is known regarding 
the natural history and late consequences of mild 
OSAHS in children. Another factor to be considered 
is that there are still no recognized criteria for classifying 
the severity of OSAHS in children.

In the present study, most of the children selected 
for adenotonsillectomy in the otorhinolaryngology 
outpatient clinic (21-77.8%) were of pre-school

age (two to six years of age), of which 62.9% were 
between three and five years of age. These results are 
consistent with the findings in the literature, since 
children in this age bracket present a greater quantity 
of lymphoid tissue in relation to the adjacent 
airway, resulting in a narrower airway.(21,22) In the 
present study, the prevalence of snoring was higher 
in boys (18–66.7%), which is different from that 
found in other studies, with the exception of that 
reported in a population-based transversal study 
carried out in Iceland, in which the prevalence of 
snoring was higher in boys than in girls (24.3% vs. 
16.5%).(9,23,24) Therefore, this difference can also be 
explained by the limited sample size of the present 
study. It is known that there is an association 
between growth retardation and OSAHS. One group 
of authors studied 41 children with SDB submitted 
to surgical treatment and found that 46% were in 
the 5th percentile in terms of weight-for-age.(25) In 
contrast with these data, the proportion of children 
in the present study presenting weight-for-age 
below the 25th percentile was 22.2% (6 children), 
and none presented weight-for-age below the 
5th percentile.

We conclude that adenotonsillectomy has a 
beneficial effect on peripheral oxygen saturation 
measured by pulse oximetry in children presenting 
airway obstruction during sleep. However, children 
in whom the symptoms persist post-operatively 
should be submitted to further investigation, since 
oxygen desaturation can be caused by conditions 
other than hyperplasia of the pharyngeal lymphoid 
tissue.
