Detailed analysis of the upper airway has not been performed in 
children with obstructive sleep apnea. We used magnetic resonance 
imaging and automatic segmentation to delineate the upper airway 
in 20 children with obstructive sleep apnea and in 20 control subjects 
(age, 3.7 . 
1.4 versus 3.9 . 
1.7 years, respectively). We measured 
mean and minimal cross-sectional area, length, and volume 
of: (1 ) the total airway; (2) regions along the adenoid, tonsils, and 
where adenoid and tonsils overlap; and (3) 10 segments at 10% 
increments along the airway. The mean cross-sectional area of the 
total airway of the obstructive sleep apnea group was significantly 
smaller in comparison with the control group, 28.1 . 
12.6 versus 

47.1 . 
18.2 mm2, respectively (p . 
0.0005). Minimal cross-sectional 
area and airway volume were smaller in this group, 4.6 . 
3.3 versus 15.7 . 
12.7 mm2 (p . 
0.0005), and 1,129 . 
515 versus 
1,794 . 
846 mm3 (p . 
0.005), respectively. Regional analysis suggested 
that the upper airway in children with obstructive sleep 
apnea is most restricted where adenoid and tonsils overlap. Segmental 
analysis demonstrated that the upper airway is restricted 
throughout the initial two-thirds of its length and that the narrowing 
is not in a discrete region adjacent to either the adenoid 
or tonsils, but rather in a continuous fashion along both.

Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in children is a 
common disorder and may affect as many as 2% of children 
(1, 2). Both anatomic and physiologic factors affecting upper 
airway size, shape, and function may play a role in the causation 
of OSAS in children. Frequently, OSAS is associated 
with adenotonsillar hyperplasia; however, abnormalities in 
craniofacial anatomy, neuromotor tone, or airway compliance 
should be considered as possible causes in children with 
the disorder when no apparent adenotonsillar hyperplasia is 
present. 

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows visualization 
and accurate measurement of the upper airway as well as of 
the various soft tissues and skeleton comprising it (3–6). 
Using MRI, we have previously shown that children with 
OSAS and no apparent craniofacial or neurologic disorder 
have decreased upper airway volume and increased adenoid 
and tonsillar volume in comparison with control subjects (5).

The three-dimensional relationship between the upper airway, 
adenoid, and tonsils has not been previously studied in 
children with OSAS. The aim of the present study was to 
characterize the differential contribution of the adenoid and 
tonsils to airway restriction along the upper airway by determining 
the cross-sectional airway area in planes orthogonal 
to the upper airway axis. To this end, we used a new 
methodology, developed on the basis of fuzzy connectedness-
based automatic segmentation (7–9), that enabled us to visualize 
and analyze the upper airway in a correct anatomic 
orientation as it relates to airflow and further delineate the 
upper airway changes that occur in children with OSAS. 

METHODS 

Subjects with OSAS 

Twenty children were recruited from the pool of patients evaluated for 
sleep-disordered breathing at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia 
(Philadelphia, PA). After OSAS was confirmed by polysomnography, 
parents provided consent for the sedation and upper airway MRI of 
their child; children older than 6 years provided their own consent. The 
study was approved by the Institutional Review Board. 

Control Subjects 

Twenty children with normal growth and development were matched 
to subjects with OSAS by age, sex, ethnicity, weight, and height. Control 
subjects were selected from among patients who underwent head MRI 
at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia for other medical indications. 
Exclusion criteria included the following: (1 ) likelihood of OSAS 
(scores of 1 or more; assessed by a standard questionnaire [10]), (2 ) 
evidence of a brain tumor or a seizure disorder requiring therapy, 

(3 ) genetic disorders associated with any craniofacial anomaly, and 
(4 ) chronic respiratory disease such as asthma or bronchopulmonary 
dysplasia. 
Overnight Polysomnography 

For subjects with OSAS, polysomnography was performed 0–4 weeks 
before MRI. Subjects were studied in the Sleep Disorders Center at 
the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Scoring of respiratory variables 
was performed on the basis of standards set by the American Thoracic 
Society and previously published data on children (11, 12). Flow was 
measured with an oral/nasal thermistor and a nasal end-tidal Pco2 catheter. 
We used the definition of obstructive apnea as absence of oral/ 
nasal thermistor signal for at least two respiratory cycles associated 
with out-of-phase movement of the rib cage and abdomen. Hypopnea 
was defined as a decrease of 50% or more in oral/nasal thermistor 
signal and a concurrent fall of 4% or more in basal oxygen saturation. 
Sleep stages were determined by the criteria of Rechtschaffen and 
Kales (13). 

Sleep Questionnaire 

A questionnaire regarding symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing 
based on the questionnaire developed by Brouillette and coworkers 

(10) was used to assess the likelihood of OSAS in control subjects and 
subjects with OSAS. On the basis of the questionnaire, no subject with 
a score less than 1 would be expected to have OSAS; a score between

1 and 3.5 is considered indeterminate, and a score greater than 3.5 
is considered highly predictive of obstructive sleep apnea. 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging 

MRI studies were performed in the Department of Radiology at the 
Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. All studies were performed while 
subjects were sedated. Sedation consisted of intravenous pentobarbital 
(2-mg/kg increments) until sleep was achieved. A maximum of three 
doses or 200 mg was administered. All subjects were monitored continuously 
by pulse oximetry and were observed by an intensive care unit 
attending physician until recovery (about 1 hour). 

All MR images were obtained as part of a larger ongoing study 
(unpublished data), using a comprehensive MR protocol. Images of 15 
of the 40 subjects in this study (9 subjects with OSAS and 6 control 
subjects) were used in a previous study (5), and were now processed 
for the first time according to the new methodology (see below) to 
further delineate airway anatomic characteristics. 

MRI was performed with a 1.5-T Vision System (Siemens, Iselin, 
NJ). Images were acquired with an anterior–posterior volume head 
coil. The patient’s head was positioned supine in the soft tissue Frankfort 
plane (tragus of the ear to orbital fissure) perpendicular to the 
table. Sequential T2-weighted spin-echo axial sections were obtained, 
spanning from the orbital cavity to the larynx. Mean acquisition time 
was 2 minutes, spin-echo repetition time (TR) .

Image Processing and Anatomic Measurements 

The MR images were transferred to a SUN workstation. Images were 
processed and segmented automatically to compute the airway including 
its surface description, centerline, and volume (Figure 1A), using 
a software program we have developed utilizing fuzzy connectedness 
segmentation (7–9) and based on 3DVIEWNIX (14). 

Upper airway centerline. We computed a centerline through the 
airway that passes through all points that are maximally distant from 
the perimeter of the airway at sequential planes orthogonal to the 
airway axis. The centerline was bounded by the upper nasopharynx 
(defined as the posterior edge of the vomer) and the lower oropharynx 
(defined as the most superior part of the epiglottis). Centerline length 
was defined as the distance along the centerline between the two boundaries. 
Airway regions adjacent to adenoid, tonsils, and the overlap 
region between adenoid and tonsils were measured along the centerline. 
Because the lower poles of the tonsils extend at times below the oropharynx, 
measurement of the airway length, area, and volume adjacent 
to the tonsils was performed along an extended airway centerline as 
defined above. 

Upper airway cross-sectional area measurements. Cross-sectional areas 
at planes orthogonal to the centerline were computed every 0.2 mm 
after interpolation, filtering, and thresholding of the original axial slices 
(9). We measured the mean and minimal cross-sectional area of the 
total airway; the mean cross-sectional area in regions adjacent to the 
adenoid, adjacent to the overlap region between the adenoid and tonsils, 
and adjacent to the tonsils; and the mean and minimal cross-sectional 
area for 10 consecutive segments at 10% increments of the centerline. 

Upper airway volume measurements. The total airway volume was 
computed as the product of centerline length and mean cross-sectional 
area. Similarly, regional airway volumes adjacent to the adenoid, adjacent 
to the overlap region between the adenoid and tonsils, and adjacent 
to the tonsils were computed as the product of mean airway cross-
sectional areas along these regions and the corresponding centerline 
lengths. Finally, volumes for 10 consecutive segments at 10% increments 
of the centerline were computed. 

Data Analysis 

Mean and standard deviation were used to summarize continuous variables. 
For comparisons between the groups for MRI data, demographics, 
and questionnaire data, we used a two-tailed unpaired t test, the 
Wilcoxon rank test, or the 2 test as appropriate. A p value of 0.05 or 
less was considered to indicate statistical significance. 

RESULTS 

We studied 20 children with OSAS, mean age 3.7 . 
1.4 years 
(range, 1.9–7.9 years), and 20 matched control subjects, mean 
age 3.9 . 
1.7 years (range, 1.9–7.8 years). Children with OSAS 
were not significantly different from control subjects with respect 
to age, sex, ethnicity, height, or weight (Table 1). All control 
subjects had normal development and cognitive function, intact 
tonsils and adenoid, and no respiratory disorders or craniofacial 
anomalies. The primary indications for head MRI of control 
subjects were as follows: single seizure/febrile convulsion (10 
subjects), migraine/headache (6 subjects), head concussion (2 
subjects), limping (1 subject), and dizziness (1 subject). Thus, 
none of these clinical indications would be expected to affect 
upper airway anatomy. 

Polysomnography 

For subjects with OSAS the mean total sleep time during polysomnography 
was 7.6 . 
0.6 hours. The mean respiratory variables 
values during this period were as follows: apnea index, 2.6 . 
4.1; apnea/hypopnea index, 8.4 . 
9.5; baseline peripheral oxygen 
saturation (SpO2), 96 . 
1%; SpO2 nadir, 85 . 
7%. Thus, these 
data suggest mild–moderate OSAS in this group. 

Sleep Questionnaire 

All control subjects had an apnea score of less than –1, indicating 
unlikelihood of obstructive sleep apnea (10), and as a group had 
a mean apnea score of 3.3 . 
0.6. This score was significantly 
lower than the apnea score noted in the OSAS group of 2.9 . 


1.5 (p . 
0.0005). 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging 

Representative three-dimensional display of the upper airway, 
its centerline, and cross-sectional images orthogonal to the centerline 
at levels of the adenoid, the region of overlap between 
adenoid and tonsils, tonsils, and the superior portion of the 
epiglottis of a control subject and a subject with OSAS are 
presented in Figures 1 and 2, respectively. 

Airway analysis. The mean cross-sectional area of the total 
upper airway of the OSAS group was significantly smaller in 
comparison with the control group, 28.1 . 
12.6 versus 47.1 . 


18.2 mm2 (p . 
0.0005). Similarly, the minimal cross-sectional 
area and upper airway volume were smaller in this group, 4.6 . 
3.3 versus 15.7 . 
12.7 mm2 (p . 
0.0005) and 1,129 . 
515 versus 
1,794 . 
846 mm3 (p . 
0.005), respectively. The upper airway 
centerline length was similar in subjects with OSAS and control 
subjects, 40.2 . 
5.8 versus 37.1 . 
8.2 mm (p . 
NS), respectively. 
Regional analysis. Analysis of the airway along the adenoid, 
the region of overlap between adenoid and tonsils, and tonsils 
in subjects with OSAS and control subjects is shown in Table 2. 
Accordingly, we noted a significantly smaller mean cross-sectional 
area in subjects with OSAS in all three regions and significantly 
smaller mean volume and a longer mean airway centerline

pressure and minimal cross-sectional area to occur mostly at the 
levels of adenoid and soft palate. These findings suggesting that 
higher airway segments are more involved in children with OSAS 
support our findings showing restriction in the upper two-thirds 
of the airway. 

Although the total centerline length was similar in OSAS 
and control groups, in regions adjacent to the adenoid and where 
the adenoid and tonsils overlap, the lengths were significantly 
longer in the OSAS group (22.6 .

respectively). This could be related to the increased extension 
of lymphoid tissue in OSAS and the more tortuous path along 
the centerline in these narrowed regions. In addition, segmental 
analysis along the entire centerline suggests that the upper airway 
of children with OSAS is restricted compared with control 
subjects over the initial 60–70% of its length. The narrowing is 
not a discrete region adjacent to either the adenoid or tonsils, 
but rather occurs in a continuous fashion along both. These 
observations suggest that flow resistance is higher in these regions, 
and complete obstruction during inspiration in sleep may 
be more likely where narrowing occurs and high negative pressures 
are developed. 

Interestingly, segmental analysis suggests that airway measurements 
below the region of maximal restriction (i.e., region 
of overlap between adenoid and tonsils) are similar in both 
groups (Figure 3). This could explain to some extent why clinical 
assessment of the tonsils and airway that are below this region 
of restriction do not predict the existence or severity of OSAS 
(19–21). 

In summary, we used MRI to analyze the size of the upper 
airway in children with OSAS. Our results suggest that the upper 
airway in children with OSAS is significantly smaller with respect 
to airway volume, mean airway cross-sectional area, and minimal 
cross-sectional area compared with matched control subjects. 
We also noted that the upper airway in children with OSAS is 
restricted along the initial 60–70% of its length and most affected 
in regions where adenoid and tonsils overlap.
