We 
evaluated 
the 
rate 
of 
complications 
experienced 
by 
children 
who 
undergo 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
syndrome 
(OSAS), 
the 
safety 
of 
a 
standard 
anesthetic 
protocol 
for 
these 
children, 
and 
preoperative 
predictors 
of 
complications. 
Sixty-one 
children 
with 
OSAS, 
confirmed 
by 
polysomnography, 
and 
21 
children 
with 
recurrent 
tonsillitis 
were 
anesthetized 
using 
a 
standard 
protocol 
before 
adenotonsillectomy 
(ages 
2–16 
yr, 
ASA 
1–3). 
The 
number 
of 
complications 
and 
medical 
interventions 
in 
the 
perioperative 
period 
were 
recorded 
and 
correlated 
with 
the 
presence 
and 
severity 
of 
OSAS. 
Children 
with 
OSAS 
had 
more 
respiratory 
complications 
per 
operation 
than 
non-OSAS 
children 
(5.7 
vs 
2.9, 
P 
. 
0.0001). 
Supraglottic 
obstruction, 
breath 
holding, 
and 
desaturation 
on 
anesthetic 
induction 
and 
emergence 
were 
the 
most 
common 
complications. 
Increased 
severity 
of 
OSAS, 
low 
weight, 
and 
young 
age 
are 
correlated 
with 
an 
increased 
rate 
of 
complications. 
Medical 
intervention 
was 
necessary 
in 
more 
children 
with 
OSAS 
during 
recovery 
and 
emergence 
than 
in 
the 
non-OSAS 
group 
(17/61 
vs 
1/21, 
P 
. 
0.05). 
Both 
groups 
of 
children 
had 
similar 
opioid 
requirements 
and 
time 
to 
discharge 
from 
the 
recovery 
room. 
These 
findings 
suggest 
that 
children 
with 
OSAS 
are 
at 
risk 
for 
respiratory 
complications 
after 
adenotonsillectomy, 
but 
that 
these 
complications 
do 
not 
prolong 
the 
time 
to 
discharge.

Sleep-disordered 
breathing 
(SDB) 
in 
children 
is 
a 
spectrum 
of 
disorders 
ranging 
from 
primary 
snoring 
to 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
syndrome 
(OSAS). 
OSAS 
is 
associated 
with 
episodes 
of 
hypopnea, 
apnea, 
and 
arterial 
oxygen 
desaturation 
(1). 
SDB 
may 
affect 
10% 
of 
children 
(2) 
while 
OSAS 
affects 
1%–4% 
of 
children 
(2–4). 
Adenotonsillectomy 
is 
the 
most 
common 
major 
surgical 
procedure 
performed 
in 
children 
(5) 
and 
has 
become 
an 
increasingly 
frequent 
treatment 
for 
OSAS 
(6). 
In 
some 
institutions, 
OSAS 
is 
the 
most 
common 
indication 
for 
adenotonsillectomy 
(7). 
In 
1996, 
approximately 
274,000 
adenotonsillectomies 
were 
performed 
as 
ambulatory 
surgery 
in 
the 
United 
States 
(8). 
The 
total 
number 
of 
procedures 
is 
probably 
higher, 
since 
the 
available 
statistics 
are 
based 
on 
data 
for 
ambulatory 
surgery 
alone 
(8). 


Polysomnography 
(PSG) 
is 
recognized 
as 
the 
“gold 
standard” 
for 
diagnosis 
and 
quantification 
of 
OSAS. 
Children 
presenting 
for 
adenotonsillectomy 
may 
have 
undergone 
PSG 
previously 
to 
confirm 
a 
clinical 
diagnosis 
of 
OSAS. 
However, 
PSG 
is 
expensive,

consuming, 
and 
unavailable 
in 
many 
sites 
where 
adenotonsillectomy 
is 
a 
common 
procedure. 
Consequently, 
most 
children 
undergoing 
surgical 
therapy 
for 
SDB 
do 
not 
undergo 
preoperative 
PSG, 
and 
the 
differentiation 
between 
primary 
snoring 
and 
OSAS 
is 
not 
known 
at 
the 
time 
of 
surgery. 


Previous 
studies 
have 
identified 
risk 
factors 
for 
postoperative 
respiratory 
complications 
in 
children 
having 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSAS 
(9–14). 
These 
retrospective 
studies 
are 
limited 
by 
the 
absence 
of 
data 
from 
PSG 
to 
diagnose 
and 
quantify 
OSAS. 
This 
issue 
is 
further 
complicated 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
clinical 
criteria 
are 
poor 
predictors 
of 
the 
presence 
or 
severity 
of 
OSAS 
(15). 
The 
present 
report 
is 
a 
prospective 
study 
of 
children 
with 
PSG-proven 
OSAS 
who 
underwent 
adenotonsillectomy 
and 
were 
compared 
to 
a 
control 
group. 
The 
goal 
of 
the 
study 
was 
to 
identify 
risk 
factors 
for 
perioperative 
complications 
in 
children 
with 
OSAS 
who 
undergo 
adenotonsillectomy. 
We 
expected 
that 
children 
with 
OSAS 
would 
have 
a 
higher 
rate 
of 
complications, 
stay 
longer 
in 
the 
recovery 
room, 
and 
have 
a 
lower 
requirement 
for 
postoperative 
morphine. 


METHODS 


Approval 
for 
this 
study 
was 
obtained 
from 
the 
IRB 
of 
the 
University 
of 
New 
Mexico 
School 
of 
Medicine 
(Human 
Research 
Review 
Committee 
Approval 
No. 
02-118). 
Children 
presenting 
to 
the 
pediatric 
otolaryngology 
service 
for 
adenotonsillectomy 
due 
to 
adenotonsillitis 
or 
sleep 
disturbance 
were 
eligible 
for 
the 


Vol.103,No.5,November20061115

study. 
All 
children 
were 
assessed 
in 
the 
pediatric 
otolaryngology 
clinic. 
The 
decision 
to 
undergo 
PSG 
was 
made 
before 
entry 
into 
the 
study. 
Children 
had 
PSG 
if 
they 
had 
signs 
or 
symptoms 
of 
a 
sleep 
disturbance, 
including 
snoring, 
mouth 
breathing, 
and 
witnessed 
breath 
holding 
for 
at 
least 
3 
mo 
duration. 
Informed 
consent 
was 
obtained 
from 
the 
caregivers 
of 
these 
children. 
Exclusion 
criteria 
included 
age 
2or 
16 
yr; 
ASA 
physical 
status 
3; 
children 
having 
additional 
surgical 
procedures 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
myringotomy 
and/or 
pressure 
equalization 
tubes; 
children 
with 
craniofacial 
abnormalities, 
Down 
syndrome, 
asthma, 
congenital 
heart 
disease; 
children 
who 
had 
undergone 
previous 
adenotonsillectomy; 
and 
children 
with 
contraindications 
to 
general 
anesthesia. 
The 
same 
surgeon 
performed 
all 
surgeries 
using 
electrocautery 
dissection. 
One 
of 
the 
two 
attending 
pediatric 
anesthesiologists 
provided 
anesthesia 
using 
a 
standardized 
protocol. 
Children 
were 
classified 
into 
two 
groups 
for 
analysis: 
those 
having 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
recurrent 
infection 
and 
those 
having 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSAS. 


The 
presence 
of 
OSAS 
was 
confirmed 
by 
preoperative 
PSG 
at 
the 
University 
of 
New 
Mexico 
sleep 
study 
laboratory. 
Data 
collected 
included 
the 
oxygen 
saturation 
nadir 
and 
the 
respiratory 
disturbance 
index 
(RDI). 
The 
RDI 
was 
defined 
as 
the 
number 
of 
apneas 
or 
hypopneas 
per 
hour. 
According 
to 
the 
University 
of 
New 
Mexico 
sleep 
laboratory, 
an 
apnea 
was 
defined 
as 
a 
decrease 
in 
flow 
of 
90% 
for 
two 
breaths 
or 
more 
and 
a 
hypopnea 
was 
defined 
as 
a 
decrease 
in 
flow 
of 
50% 
or 
more, 
coupled 
with 
a 
3% 
decrease 
in 
saturation 
or 
an 
electroencephalogram 
arousal. 
An 
RDI 
of 
2 
or 
more 
was 
necessary 
for 
a 
diagnosis 
of 
OSAS. 
Observers 
were 
blinded 
to 
the 
outcome 
of 
PSG 
and 
diagnosis 
of 
the 
child. 


A 
history 
and 
physical 
examination 
were 
obtained 
from 
all 
children 
before 
surgery. 
Anxiety 
scores 
were 
evaluated 
using 
the 
modified 
Yale 
Preoperative 
Anxiety 
Scale 
(mYPAS) 
(16). 
A 
sedative 
premedication 
of 


0.33 
mg/kg 
of 
oral 
midazolam 
was 
administered 
10–15 
min 
before 
induction 
of 
anesthesia. 
Children 
were 
brought 
to 
the 
operating 
room 
(OR) 
and 
standard 
monitors 
established. 
Induction 
of 
anesthesia 
was 
accomplished 
using 
8% 
sevoflurane 
in 
100% 
oxygen. 
After 
induction, 
when 
the 
patient 
reached 
stage 
3 
of 
anesthesia, 
a 
peripheral 
IV 
catheter 
was 
established 
and 
morphine 
0.1 
mg/kg, 
dexamethasone 
0.5 
mg/kg 
(maximum 
10 
mg), 
and 
ondansetron 
0.1 
mg/kg 
were 
given. 
A 
few 
positive 
pressure 
breaths 
were 
delivered 
to 
insure 
that 
an 
adequate 
depth 
of 
anesthesia 
was 
attained 
and 
the 
trachea 
was 
intubated 
with 
an 
age-appropriate 
oral 
RAE 
endotracheal 
tube. 
A 
tracheal 
air 
leak 
at 
10–30 
cm 
H2O 
was 
confirmed. 
Sevoflurane 
was 
reduced 
to 
attain 
an 
end-tidal 
concentration 
of 
1.5%. 
Lactated 
Ringer’s 
solution 
(20 
mL/kg) 
was 
given 
over 
the 
course 
of 
the 
procedure. 
Patients 
were 
maintained 
on 
positive 
pressure 
ventilation 
until 
they 
showed 
signs 
of 
spontaneous 
ventilation. 
At 
this 
point, 
they 
were 
allowed 
to 
resume 
spontaneous 
ventilation. 
Upon 
completion 
of 
surgery, 
sevoflurane 
was 
discontinued 
and 
the 
oronasopharynx 
and 
stomach 
were 
suctioned 
by 
the 
surgeon. 
All 
children 
were 
awake 
with 
eye 
opening 
and 
purposeful 
movement 
for 
tracheal 
extubation. 
When 
steady 
spontaneous 
ventilation 
was 
established, 
they 
were 
taken 
to 
the 
recovery 
room. 
Children 
age 
3 
yr 
or 
older 
with 
a 
pain 
score 
of 
4/10 
or 
more 
on 
the 
Wong–Baker 
scale 
(17) 
or 
age 
3 
yr 
on 
the 
FLACC 
score 
(18) 
received 
0.025 
mg/kg 
of 
IV 
morphine. 
Pain 
was 
assessed 
on 
complaint 
and 
every 
15 
min. 
The 
attending 
anesthesiologist 
evaluated 
any 
postoperative 
nausea 
or 
vomiting 
(PONV). 
Nausea 
persisting 
for 
5 
min 
or 
one 
episode 
of 
vomiting 
was 
treated 
with 
IV 
ondansetron 
0.1 
mg/kg. 
All 
children 
received 
oxygen 
during 
transport 
to 
the 
recovery 
room 
and 
until 
room 
air 
saturations 
could 
be 
maintained 
above 
92%. 
Children 
with 
OSAS 
and 
all 
children 
3 
yr 
of 
age 
were 
admitted 
to 
monitored 
pediatric 
beds 
postoperatively. 
Non-OSAS 
children 
older 
than 
3 
yr 
were 
discharged 
home. 
The 
usual 
admission 
criteria 
for 
children 
having 
adenotonsillectomy 
at 
the 
University 
of 
New 
Mexico 
were 
followed. 


The 
study 
period 
was 
divided 
into 
four 
discrete 
time 
frames: 
induction/intubation; 
maintenance 
of 
anesthesia; 
emergence 
from 
anesthesia; 
and 
postoperative 
recovery. 
The 
induction/intubation 
period 
extended 
from 
the 
time 
oral 
midazolam 
was 
administered 
to 
the 
time 
of 
successful 
intubation. 
Maintenance 
of 
anesthesia 
began 
at 
the 
time 
of 
tracheal 
intubation 
and 
continued 
until 
the 
completion 
of 
surgery. 
Emergence 
was 
defined 
as 
the 
time 
from 
the 
finish 
of 
surgery 
until 
the 
patient 
left 
the 
OR. 
Postoperative 
recovery 
was 
from 
the 
time 
the 
patient 
left 
the 
OR 
until 
discharge 
from 
the 
recovery 
room. 
Discharge 
criteria 
were 
met 
by 
achieving 
a 
modified 
Aldrete 
score 
of 
9 
(19). 
Aldrete 
scores 
were 
recorded 
by 
the 
recovery 
room 
nurse 
at 
15-min 
intervals 
and 
confirmed 
by 
the 
attending 
anesthesiologist 
before 
patient 
discharge. 
The 
following 
data 
were 
recorded 
during 
the 
time 
periods: 
duration 
of 
each 
time 
frame; 
number 
of 
events 
of 
breath-
holding; 
number 
of 
events 
of 
bronchospasm; 
supraglottic 
obstruction; 
number 
of 
events 
of 
laryngospasm; 
Cormack–Lehane 
(20) 
score 
for 
difficulty 
of 
visualization 
of 
the 
laryngeal 
opening 
at 
intubation 
(Grade 
1: 
no 
difficulty, 
Grade 
2: 
posterior 
glottis 
only 
seen, 
Grade 
3: 
only 
epiglottis 
seen, 
Grade 
4: 
epiglottis 
not 
visible); 
number 
of 
attempts 
at 
intubation; 
number 
of 
mild 
(92%) 
and 
severe 
(85%) 
desaturation 
events; 
need 
for 
reintubation 
during 
emergence; 
need 
for 
postoperative 
pain 
medication; 
and 
occurrence 
of 
treated 
PONV. 
Supraglottic 
obstruction 
was 
defined 
as 
the 
need 
for 
an 
oral 
airway 
or, 
in 
recovery, 
persistent 
jaw 
thrust. 
The 
need 
for 
placement 
of 
an 
oral 
airway 
or 
jaw 
thrust 
was 
determined 
clinically 
based 
on 
observation 
of 
work-of-breathing, 
retraction, 
and 
tidal 
volumes. 
A 
complication 
was 
defined 
as 
an 
airway 
event 
which, 
if 
left 
undetected 
or 
untreated, 
could

lead 
to

and 
included 
the 
following: 
breath

supraglottic 
obstruction; 
bronchospasm; 
laryngospasm; 
oxygen 
desaturation 
92%; 
oxygen 
desaturation 
85%; 
more 
than 
one 
attempt 
at 
intubation; 
the 
need 
for 
postoperative 
pain 
medication 
and/or 
postoperative 
antiemetics; 
or 
the 
need 
for 
reintubation. 
Medical 
intervention 
in 
recovery 
was 
defined 
as 
the 
need 
for 
oral 
airway, 
oxygen 
to 
keep 
O2 
saturations 
more 
than 
92%, 
assisted 
ventilation 
and 
reintubation. 


Analysis 
of 
previous 
surgical 
records 
showed 
that 
the 
diagnosis 
of 
OSAS 
was 
about 
three 
times 
as 
common 
as 
adenotonsillitis 
as 
the 
presenting 
cause 
for 
adenotonsillectomy. 
To 
calculate 
an 
appropriate 
sample 
size, 
it 
was 
assumed 
that 
children 
with 
OSAS 
present 
for 
surgery 
three 
times 
as 
often 
as 
children 
without 
OSAS, 
and 
that 
the 
number 
of 
complications 
per 
anesthetic 
was 
four 
in 
children 
with 
OSAS 
and 
two 
in 
children 
without 
OSAS. 
We 
postulated 
that 
complications 
were 
twice 
as 
common 
in 
OSAS 
patients 
having 
adenotonsillectomy 
and 
that 
a 
doubled 
rate 
of 
complications 
would 
be 
clinically 
significant. 
This 
analysis 
indicated 
that 
a 
sample 
size 
of 
32 
is 
adequate 
to 
detect 
a 
significant 
difference 
in 
the 
number 
of 
complications 
per 
anesthetic 
between 
the 
two 
groups 
with 
80% 
power 
and 
. 
. 
0.05. 


To 
assess 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
relative 
severity 
of 
OSAS 
on 
complication 
rates, 
a 
“cut 
score” 
analysis 
was 
done 
as 
follows. 
Data 
on 
complications 
for 
children 
with 
OSAS 
were 
tabulated 
by 
increasing 
intervals 
of5Uon 
the 
RDI 
score. 
Data 
were 
tabulated 
and 
analyzed 
as 
the 
number 
of 
children 
who 
had 
a 
specific 
complication. 
For 
example, 
4/20 
means 
4 
of 
20 
children 
had 
a 
certain 
complication. 
Fisher’s 
exact 
test 
was 
used 
to 
make 
two 
types 
of 
comparisons 
of 
complication 
rates: 
1) 
between 
children 
with 
OSAS 
and 
children 
without 
OSAS 
and 
2) 
between 
groups 
of 
children 
with 
OSAS 
but 
with 
different 
RDI 
scores. 
Logistic 
regression 
was 
used 
to 
define 
likely 
sets 
of 
complications. 


When 
a 
child 
may 
have 
had 
more 
than 
one 
event 
of 
a 
particular 
complication 
during 
the 
anesthetic, 
for 
example 
desaturation 
92%, 
“event 
rates” 
were 
calculated. 
Event 
rates 
were 
tabulated 
as 
the 
number 
of 
occurrences 
of 
a 
certain 
complication 
experienced 
by 
all 
the 
children 
in 
one 
group. 
For 
example, 
an 
event 
rate 
of 
7/20 
means 
that 
a 
total 
of 
seven 
events 
of 
a 
complication 
were 
experienced 
by 
a 
group 
of 
20 
children. 
These 
seven 
events 
may 
have 
occurred 
in 
fewer 
than 
seven 
children. 
It 
was 
assumed 
that 
event 
rates, 
which 
are 
not 
independent 
variables, 
followed 
a 
Poisson 
distribution 
instead 
of 
a 
normal 
distribution. 
The 
analysis 
of 
event 
rates 
was 
verified 
using 
Poisson 
regression; 
the 
Poisson 
rates 
were 
analogous 
to 
the 
event 
rates 
and 
the 
P 
values 
similar. 


A 
P 
value 
0.05 
was 
used 
to 
establish 
the 
statistical 
significance 
of 
differences 
between 
groups.

RESULTS 


Eighty-three 
children 
were 
considered 
and 
82 
were 
enrolled 
in 
the 
study, 
61 
with 
a 
diagnosis 
of 
OSAS 
and 
21 
with 
recurrent 
adenotonsillitis 
(non-OSAS 
group). 
One 
child 
with 
OSAS 
refused 
consent 
and 
was 
not 
enrolled. 
Data 
on 
all 
82 
children 
were 
completed 
and 
analyzed. 
Table 
1 
shows 
the 
characteristics 
of 
the 
children. 
There 
were 
no 
significant 
statistical 
differences 
between 
the 
groups 
with 
respect 
to 
age, 
weight, 
height, 
body 
mass 
index, 
ratio 
of 
male 
to 
female 
and 
mYPAS 
scores. 
There 
were 
no 
differences 
in 
characteristics 
of 
the 
children 
or 
complication 
rates 
between 
the 
two 
anesthesia 
providers. 
One 
provider 
anesthetized 
36 
children 
and 
the 
other 
46 
children. 
The 
OSAS 
group 
had 
RDI 
values 
ranging 
from 
2 
to 
88 
(mean 
16.8, 
sd 
19.4) 
and 
oxygen 
saturation 
nadir 
ranging 
from 
33%–95% 
(mean 
84, 
sd 
8.5). 
OSAS 
children 
had 
more 
complications 
per 
patient 
than 
non-OSAS 
children 
(5.7 
vs 
2.9, 
P 
. 
0.0001). 


Children 
with 
OSAS 
experienced 
more 
complications 
during 
anesthetic 
induction 
(Table 
2). 
They 
were 
more 
likely 
to 
have 
a 
Cormack–Lehane 
score 
2 
(16/61 
vs 
1/21, 
P 
.

Requirement 
of 
more 
than 
one 
attempt 
at 
tracheal 
intubation 
did 
not 
reach 
statistical 
significance 
(17/61 
vs 
2/21, 
P 
. 
0.13). 
The 
incidence 
of 
supraglottic 
obstruction 
on 
induction 
was 
higher 
in 
the 
OSAS 
group 
(38/61 
vs 
5/21, 
P 
. 
0.005), 
as 
was 
desaturation 
92% 
on 
induction 
(18/61 
vs 
0/21, 
P 
. 
0.009). 
Children 
with 
OSAS 
also 
had 
more 
episodes 
of 
breath 
holding 
on 
induction, 
but 
this 
did 
not 
reach 
statistical 
significance 
(20/61 
vs 
3/21, 
P 
. 
0.16). 


Children 
in 
the 
OSAS 
group 
had 
more 
complications 
on 
emergence 
(Table 
3). 
More 
children 
had 
episodes 
of 
breath 
holding 
on 
emergence 
(28/61 
vs 
1/21, 
P 
. 
0.001) 
and 
supraglottic 
obstruction 
on 
emergence 
(9/61 
vs 
0/21, 
P 
. 
0.1) 
as 
well 
as 
desaturation. 
Desaturation 
to 
92% 
occurred 
in 
9/61 
children 
with 
OSAS 
versus 
1/21 
in 
children 
without 
OSAS 
(P 
. 
0.5). 
The 
event 
rate 
(total 
number 
of 
episodes 
of 
desaturation 
for 
the 
whole 
group) 
for 
OSAS 
children 
was 
higher 
(26/61 
vs 
1/21). 
Desaturation 
to 
85% 
occurred 
in 
seven 
children 
with 
OSAS 
compared 
to 
one 
child 
without 
OSAS. 
Again, 
the 
event 
rate 
for 
desaturation 
to 
85% 
was 
higher 
in 
the

DISCUSSION 


This 
study 
shows 
that 
adenotonsillectomy 
in 
children 
with 
OSAS 
is 
associated 
with 
an 
increased 
incidence 
of 
perioperative 
respiratory 
complications. 
These 
complications 
require 
more 
medical 
intervention 
in 
children 
with 
OSAS. 
Most 
complications 
occurred 
either 
during 
induction 
from 
anesthesia 
or 
emergence 
from 
anesthesia. 
Children 
with 
more 
severe 
OSAS 
as 
measured 
by 
PSG 
experienced 
more 
severe 
complications. 
The 
duration 
of 
postoperative 
recovery 
and 
the 
need 
for 
analgesic 
and 
antiemetic 
medication 
were 
similar 
in 
children, 
with 
or 
without 
OSAS. 
Severe 
complications 
such 
as 
laryngospasm 
and 
bronchospasm 
were 
uncommon. 


Since 
children 
with 
OSAS 
experience 
more 
perioperative 
complications 
after 
adenotonsillectomy, 
some 
practitioners 
have 
advocated 
an 
altered 
anesthetic 
regimen 
for 
these 
children 
(1,9). 
For 
the 
present 
study, 
we 
designed 
an 
anesthetic 
technique 
for 
children 
without 
OSAS 
and 
used 
the 
same 
technique 
on 
children 
with 
OSAS 
to 
verify 
its 
safety. 
It 
has 
also 
been 
asserted 
that 
the 
use 
of 
sedative 
premedication 
is 
contraindicated 
in 
children 
with 
OSAS 
(21,22). 
However, 
there 
is 
little 
evidence 
against 
the 
use 
of 
sedative 
premedication 
for 
these 
children 
(23). 
Sevoflurane 
is 
widely 
used 
in 
children 
and 
can 
be 
used 
for 
both 
induction 
and 
maintenance 
of 
anesthesia. 
Morphine 
was 
chosen 
for 
its 
long 
duration 
of 
action. 
Double 
therapy 
with 
dexamethasone 
and 
ondansetron 
was 
used 
to 
reduce 
the 
high 
rate 
of 
PONV 
associated 
with 
adenotonsillectomy 
(24). 


Several 
studies 
have 
indicated 
that 
children 
with 
OSAS 
have 
behavioral 
problems, 
including 
inattention, 
hyperactivity, 
and 
increased 
anxiety 
(25–27). 
We 
evaluated 
all 
children 
in 
the 
study 
using 
the 
mYPAS 


and 
observed 
no 
differences 
in 
preoperative 
anxiety 
levels 
between 
children 
with 
OSAS 
and 
children 
without 
OSAS. 
This 
implies 
that 
differences 
in 
complication 
rates 
between 
the 
two 
groups 
cannot 
be 
explained 
by 
variation 
in 
levels 
of 
anxiety. 


All 
children 
were 
anesthetized 
to 
stage 
3 
of 
anesthesia 
to 
allow 
easy 
placement 
of 
a 
peripheral 
IV 
line 
and 
laryngoscopy. 
Children 
with 
OSAS 
took 
longer 
to 
achieve 
this 
depth 
of 
anesthesia. 
They 
had 
more 
episodes 
of 
supraglottic 
obstruction, 
breath 
holding, 
and 
oxygen 
desaturation. 
These 
events 
may 
have 
resulted 
from 
decreased 
muscle 
tone, 
since 
children 
with 
OSAS 
rely 
more 
on 
upper 
airway 
tone 
to 
maintain 
airway 
patency, 
and 
have 
airway 
closing 
pressures 
above 
atmospheric 
pressure 
(28). 
As 
a 
result, 
minute 
ventilation 
could 
be 
decreased 
thus 
prolonging 
the 
time 
to 
achieve 
adequate 
depth 
of 
anesthesia. 
Oxygen 
desaturation 
may 
also 
result 
from 
episodes 
of 
airway 
obstruction 
and 
breath 
holding 
or 
decreased 
minute 
ventilation. 
Children 
with 
OSAS 
had 
higher 
Cormack–Lehane 
scores 
but 
the 
likelihood 
of 
requiring 
multiple 
attempts 
at 
tracheal 
intubation 
was 
not 
statistically 
significant. 
Perhaps 
the 
tonsils 
of 
children 
with 
OSAS 
are 
larger, 
or 
the 
decreased 
oropharyngeal 
tone 
and 
resultant 
airway 
collapse 
reduces 
visibility 
of 
the 
laryngeal 
inlet. 
Children 
with 
OSAS 
not 
only 
required 
a 
longer 
time 
for 
induction, 
but 
also 
had 
a 
prolonged 
emergence 
and 
time 
to 
extubation. 
These 
delays 
may 
be 
the 
result 
of 
a 
slow 
return 
of 
upper 
airway 
tone 
that 
makes 
it 
more 
difficult 
to 
attain 
regular 
spontaneous 
respiratory 
patterns. 


In 
previous 
reports, 
an 
RDI 
more 
than 
10 
has 
been 
identified 
as 
a 
risk 
factor 
for 
postoperative 
desaturation 
to 
70% 
or 
postoperative 
hypercapnia 
to 
more 
than 
45 
mm 
Hg 
(9). 
It 
has 
also 
been 
reported 
that 
an 
RDI 
more 
than 
40 
is 
a 
significant 
predictor 
of 
postoperative 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
and 
desaturation 
to 


80% 
(11). 
In 
this 
study, 
the 
complication 
rate 
on 
both 
induction 
and 
emergence 
increased 
as 
RDI 
increased 
in 
children 
with 
OSAS. 
Children 
with 
an 
RDI 
more 
than 
20 
were 
predisposed 
to 
breath 
holding 
on 
induction 
and 
children 
with 
an 
RDI 
more 
than 
30 
were 
more 
likely 
to 
experience 
laryngospasm 
on 
emergence 
and 
oxygen 
desaturation 
to 
92% 
and 
as 
low 
as 
85% 
on 
emergence. 
Children 
with 
OSAS 
not 
only 
had 
more 
frequent 
complications 
during 
induction 
and 
emergence 
but 
also 
were 
more 
likely 
to 
require 
supplemental 
oxygen, 
oral 
airway 
use, 
or 
assisted 
ventilation 
in 
the 
immediate 
postoperative 
period. 
However, 
there 
was 
no 
significant 
difference 
in 
the 
time 
taken 
to 
reach 
the 
discharge 
criterion 
of 
a 
modified 
Aldrete 
score 
of 
9, 
implying 
that 
these 
complications 
may 
resolve 
quickly. 
This 
finding 
is 
similar 
to 
that 
seen 
in 
adults 
in 
whom 
the 
diagnosis 
of 
OSAS 
is 
not 
a 
risk 
factor 
for 
unanticipated 
admission 
or 
adverse 
events 
after 
outpatient 
surgery 
(29). 
However, 
we 
cannot 
draw 
a 
similar 
conclusion 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
present 
data. 
Unanticipated 
admission 
was 
not 
measured 
in 
our 
study, 
since

all 
OSAS 
children 
and 
children 
3 
yr 
of 
age 
were 
scheduled 
for 
admission 
regardless 
of 
their 
condition 
in 
the 
postoperative 
recovery 
unit. 
There 
were 
no 
unanticipated 
admissions 
among 
those 
scheduled 
for 
same 
day 
discharge. 
The 
demonstration 
that 
discharge 
criteria 
are 
not 
delayed 
for 
OSAS 
children 
may 
imply 
that 
some 
of 
these 
children 
do 
not 
need 
admission. 
Despite 
PSG 
data 
to 
suggest 
that 
OSAS 
children 
have 
significant 
improvement 
in 
symptoms 
by 
the 
night 
after 
surgery 
(23), 
a 
prospective 
study 
of 
admitted 
children 
that 
records 
postoperative 
obstructive 
and 
respiratory 
complications 
would 
be 
necessary 
to 
identify 
the 
characteristics 
of 
children 
who 
do 
not 
require 
admission. 


In 
previous 
studies, 
the 
rate 
of 
postoperative 
respiratory 
compromise 
requiring 
medical 
intervention 
in 
children 
undergoing 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSAS 
ranged 
from 
21%–36% 
(9–12). 
The 
choice 
of 
anesthetic 
technique 
had 
no 
obvious 
effect 
on 
postoperative 
complication 
rates 
in 
these 
studies. 
When 
a 
variety 
of 
techniques 
were 
analyzed, 
the 
rates 
were 
similar 
to 
our 
standardized 
protocol 
(9,12). 
In 
the 
present 
study, 
5% 
of 
the 
non-OSAS 
group 
and 
28% 
of 
the 
OSAS 
group 
required 
medical 
intervention 
postoperatively. 
Young 
age 
correlated 
with 
supraglottic 
obstruction 
on 
induction, 
desaturation 
to 
92% 
on 
induction 
and 
maintenance, 
and 
desaturation 
to 
85% 
on 
maintenance 
and 
emergence. 
This 
is 
supported 
by 
previous 
reports 
identifying 
age 
of 
3 
yr 
as 
a 
risk 
factor 
(9,11). 
Oxygen 
saturation 
nadir 
correlated 
with 
breath 
holding 
and 
supraglottic 
obstruction 
on 
induction, 
as 
has 
been 
previously 
reported 
(11,12). 


Previous 
observations 
have 
shown 
a 
correlation 
between 
weight 
less 
than 
the 
5th 
percentile 
and 
increased 
perioperative 
complications 
(11). 
Our 
study 
showed 
a 
correlation 
between 
low 
weight 
and 
desaturation 
to 
92% 
and 
to 
85% 
during 
maintenance 
of 
anesthesia. 
However, 
there 
was 
no 
increased 
tendency 
to 
obstruction 
on 
induction 
or 
to 
oxygen 
desaturation 
on 
induction 
and 
emergence 
in 
low 
weight 
children. 
We 
did 
not 
analyze 
weight 
as 
a 
function 
of 
percentile 
for 
different 
age 
groups. 
Such 
an 
analysis 
would 
require 
a 
larger 
study 
population. 


It 
has 
been 
reported 
that 
children 
with 
OSAS 
have 
a 
reduced 
opioid 
requirement 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
(30) 
and 
have 
specific 
sensitivity 
to 
opioids 
(31). 
This 
is 
also 
a 
common 
clinical 
expectation. 
In 
the 
present 
study, 
children 
with 
OSAS 
had 
the 
same 
morphine 
requirement 
as 
those 
without 
OSAS. 
However, 
children 
with 
OSAS 
who 
had 
an 
RDI 
5 
were 
more 
likely 
to 
require 
supplemental 
morphine 
than 
those 
with 
an 
RDI 
5. 
Though 
unexpected, 
these 
data 
reflect 
the 
observation 
that 
adults 
with 
OSAS 
are 
more 
likely 
to 
require 
unanticipated 
admission 
for 
pain 
management 
after 
outpatient 
surgery 
than 
adults 
without 
OSAS 
(29). 
The 
perioperative 
use 
of 
long-
acting 
opioids 
in 
the 
present 
study 
did 
not 
appear 
to 
increase 
complications 
or 
prolong 
recovery 
times. 


The 
strengths 
of 
this 
study 
are 
the 
use 
of 
objective 
data 
from 
PSG 
to 
quantify 
the 
severity 
of 
OSAS 
and 
use 
of 
a 
standardized 
protocol 
involving 
only 
a 
single 
surgeon 
and 
two 
anesthesiologists 
to 
collect 
prospective 
data. 


The 
limitations 
of 
the 
study 
are 
the 
relatively 
small 
size 
of 
the 
study 
population 
and 
the 
inability 
to 
collect 
data 
on 
all 
children 
after 
discharge 
from 
the 
recovery 
room. 
Therefore, 
we 
are 
unable 
to 
address 
the 
issue 
of 
the 
required 
duration 
of 
observation 
before 
discharge 
of 
patients 
who 
have 
been 
admitted. 
We 
also 
did 
not 
perform 
PSG 
on 
children 
with 
recurrent 
adenotonsillitis. 
Of 
course, 
some 
children 
have 
both 
recurrent 
infections 
and 
sleep 
disturbance 
before 
tonsillectomy. 
It 
is 
therefore 
possible 
that 
some 
of 
these 
children 
had 
OSAS 
that 
remained 
unrecognized. 
Ideally, 
all 
patients 
would 
have 
had 
PSG. 
We 
can 
only 
correlate 
complications 
with 
RDI 
for 
patients 
who 
had 
PSG 
and 
a 
RDI 
2. 
Intuitively, 
RDI 
2 
would 
follow 
the 
same 
correlative 
trend. 
Over 
the 
last 
20 
yr 
there 
has 
been 
a 
trend 
towards 
performing 
more 
tonsillectomies, 
particularly 
in 
younger 
children, 
for 
OSAS. 
However, 
regional 
differences 
are 
likely 
to 
play 
a 
role 
in 
the 
proportion 
of 
children 
per 
institution 
who 
undergo 
tonsillectomy 
for 
a 
sleep 
disturbance 
versus 
recurrent 
infection. 
Our 
data 
are 
from 
a 
large 
tertiary 
care 
facility 
in 
an 
ethnically 
diverse 
state 
and 
may 
not 
closely 
reflect 
national 
trends. 


The 
size 
of 
the 
study 
population 
did 
not 
provide 
sufficient 
statistical 
power 
to 
show 
significant 
differences 
in 
some 
clinically 
relevant 
complications, 
such 
as 
desaturation 
on 
induction 
to 
85%, 
breath 
holding 
on 
induction 
(OSAS 
20/61, 
non-OSAS 
3/21), 
or 
in 
supraglottic 
obstruction 
on 
emergence 
for 
the 
two 
groups 
of 
children 
studied. 
Event 
rates 
of 
desaturation 
to 


92% 
on 
emergence 
(OSAS 
26/61, 
non-OSAS 
1/21) 
and 
desaturation 
to 
85% 
on 
emergence 
(OSAS 
16/61, 
non-
OSAS 
1/21) 
are 
provided 
only 
as 
clinical 
observations, 
since 
they 
were 
not 
statistically 
significant. 
Having 
confirmed 
prospectively 
that 
OSAS 
children 
do 
have 
increased 
perioperative 
respiratory 
complications, 
the 
most 
important 
research 
question 
is 
to 
define 
what 
subgroup 
of 
adenotonsillectomy 
children 
requires 
postoperative 
admission, 
and 
for 
how 
long. 
Though 
no 
anesthetic 
technique 
has 
been 
shown 
to 
alter 
the 
complication 
rate, 
there 
have 
been 
insufficient 
prospective 
studies 
comparing 
different 
techniques. 


An 
anesthetic 
technique 
designed 
for 
non-OSAS 
children 
may 
be 
used 
in 
OSAS 
children 
and, 
in 
fact, 
OSAS 
children 
may 
require 
and 
tolerate 
more 
opioid 
analgesia 
than 
previously 
thought. 
Even 
though 
perioperative 
complications 
are 
common 
in 
these 
children, 
they 
occur 
mainly 
on 
induction 
and 
emergence, 
can 
be 
easily 
managed, 
and 
resolve 
quickly 
so 
as 
not 
to 
extend 
time 
spent 
attaining 
recovery 
room 
discharge 
criteria. 
However, 
additional 
risk 
factors 
such 
as 
young 
age 
and 
increased 
RDI 
must 
be 
considered. 
Fortunately, 
there 
was 
no 
increased 
risk 
of 
severe, 
immediate 
complications 
in 
OSAS 
children.
