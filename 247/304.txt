Results 
The 
mean 
(±SEM) 
age 
of 
19 
subjects 
meeting 
inclusion 
criteria 
was 
16.5±0.35 
years, 
mean 
body 
mass 
index 
was 
60.3±2.11 
kg/m2, 
and 
66% 
were 
female. 
Obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
was 
present 
in 
14 
subjects 
(74%). 
The 
average 
interval 
between 
the 
baseline 
and 
repeat 
polysomnograms 
was 
0.91±0.16 
years, 
and 
average 
weight

was 
66.4± 


8.8 
kg. 
Surgical 
weight 
loss 
resulted 
in 
increased 
sleep 
efficiency 
(80.2% 
vs 
73.1%, 
p=0.01), 
reduced 
time 
in 
stage 
1 
sleep 
(3.0% 
vs 
6.0%, 
p=0.02), 
and 
reduced 
arousal 
index 
(7.6±0.6/h 
vs 
11.3±1.2, 
p=0.01). 
Conclusion 
Our 
data 
demonstrate 
a 
marked 
improvement 
in 
sleep 
efficiency 
and 
sleep 
fragmentation 
with 
surgical 
weight 
loss. 
Given 
the 
emerging 
evidence 
that 
surgical 
weight 
loss 
results 
in 
resolution 
of 
obesity-associated 
psychosocial, 
metabolic, 
and 
cardiovascular 
morbidity, 
these 
results 
suggest 
that 
correction 
of 
sleep 
fragmentation 
could 
be 
an 
important 
but 
as 
yet 
underappreciated 
factor 
influencing 
changes 
in 
these 
other 
major 
comorbidities 
of 
obesity.

Introduction 


The 
prevalence 
of 
childhood 
overweight 
and 
obesity 
is 
increasing 
at 
an 
alarming 
rate 
and 
has 
doubled 
in 
the 
past 
two 
decades 
in 
the 
USA 
[1]. 
Currently, 
17.1% 
of 
US 
children 
and 
adolescents 
are 
overweight, 
with 
even 
higher 
rates 
among 
minority 
and 
economically 
disadvantaged 
children 
[1–4]. 
Pediatric 
obesity 
is 
associated 
with 
meta

bolic 
(insulin 
resistance, 
type-2 
diabetes 
and 
dyslipidemia 
[5, 
6]), 
cardiovascular 
(hypertension 
[7], 
structural 
cardiac 
changes 
[8]) 
and 
psychosocial 
(low 
self 
esteem 
[9], 
depression 
[10]), 
and 
neuro-cognitive 
morbidity. 
With 
the 
increasing 
prevalence 
of 
childhood 
obesity, 
the 
public 
health 
impact 
of 
these 
comorbid 
conditions 
is 
becoming 
a 
significant 
concern 
[7, 
11]. 
Further, 
the 
long-term 
societal 
cost 
is 
immense, 
as 
the 
odds 
of 
childhood 
obesity 
persisting 
into 
adulthood 
is 
estimated 
to 
increase 
from 
approximately 


1.3 
for 
1–2-year-olds 
to 
17.5 
for 
15–17-year-olds 
[12]. 
Obesity 
is 
a 
proinflammatory 
condition, 
and 
levels 
of 
several 
inflammatory 
cytokines 
are 
elevated 
in 
obese 
subjects 
as 
compared 
to 
controls 
[13]. 
The 
development 
and 
progression 
of 
obesity-associated 
morbidity 
is 
believed 
to 
be, 
in 
part, 
due 
to 
sleep 
restriction 
and 
sleep 
fragmentation. 
Weight 
loss 
results 
in 
improvement 
in 
morbidity 
associated 
with 
obesity 
[14, 
15]. 
Pathogenesis 
of 
obesity-
related 
comorbid 
conditions 
may 
be 
elucidated 
in 
part 
by 
assessment 
of 
the 
effect 
of 
significant 
weight 
reduction 
on 
key 
physiologic 
processes. 
Such 
knowledge 
may 
then 
be 
used 
for 
the 
development 
of 
strategies 
to 
prevent 
development 
and 
progression 
of 
obesity-associated 
comorbidity. 
While 
the 
effect 
of 
weight 
loss 
on 
indices 
of 
respiratory 
disturbance 
during 
sleep 
has 
been 
investigated 
by 
several 
researchers 
[14, 
16], 
there 
is 
a 
paucity 
of 
literature 
addressing 
the 
effect 
of 
weight 
loss 
on 
sleep 
electroencephalogram 
(EEG) 
characteristics. 
The 
purpose 
of 
our 
study 
was, 
thus, 
to 
determine 
the 
effect 
of 
surgical 
weight 
loss 
on 
electroencephalographically 
defined 
sleep 
architecture 
in 
a 
population 
of 
adolescents 
with 
severe 
obesity 
participating 
in 
an 
adolescent 
surgical 
weight 
management 
program. 


Methods 


Study 
Design 


We 
conducted 
a 
retrospective 
review 
of 
clinical 
data 
obtained 
during 
the 
evaluation 
of 
all 
patients 
who 
underwent 
laparoscopic 
Roux-en-Y 
gastric 
bypass 
surgery 
at 
Cincinnati 
Children’s 
Hospital 
Medical 
Center 
between 
July 
2001 
and 
June 
2007. 
Approval 
for 
this 
project 
was 
granted 
by 
our 
Institutional 
Review 
Board. 


Subjects 


All 
subjects 
were 
physician-referred 
and 
were 
selected 
for 
weight 
loss 
surgery 
by 
the 
bariatric 
board 
of 
the 
Comprehensive 
Weight 
Management 
Center, 
using 
adolescent 
patient 
selection 
criteria, 
as 
described 
previously 
[17, 
18]. 
Body 
weights 
were 
recorded 
using 
a 
digital 
scale 
and 
heights 
were 
measured 
using 
a 
calibrated 
wall-mounted 


stadiometer. 
All 
weights 
were 
obtained 
in 
light 
clothing 
and 
without 
shoes. 
Weight 
and 
height 
information 
were 
used 
to 
calculate 
body 
mass 
index 
(BMI) 
(weight 
[kg]/height 
[m]2). 


Subjects 
included 
in 
this 
study 
had 
a 
baseline 
and 
postweight-
loss 
assessment 
of 
sleep 
characteristics 
by 
an 
overnight 
polysomnogram. 
Polysomnograms 
were 
performed 
in 
the 
sleep 
laboratory 
at 
Cincinnati 
Children’s 
Sleep 
Center 
using 
a 
computerized 
system 
(Grass, 
Telefactor, 
Astro, 
West 
Warwick, 
RI, 
USA). 
Patients 
were 
not 
deprived 
of 
sleep 
prior 
to 
the 
study, 
nor 
were 
they 
given 
sedatives. 
The 
following 
standardized 
parameters 
were 
recorded 
during 
the 
study: 
EEG 
(C3 
–A2,C4 
–A1,O1 
–A2, 
and 
O2 
–A1); 
right 
and 
left 
electrooculogram; 
submental, 
tibial, 
and 
intercostal 
electromyogram; 
electrocardiography; 
nasal/oral 
airflow 
through 
nasal 
pressure 
sensor; 
oxygen 
saturation 
by 
pulse 
oximeter 
(Nelcor 
N1000); 
oximeter 
pulse 
waveform; 
and 
video 
monitoring 
using 
an 
infrared 
video 
camera 
and 
recorded 
on 
a 
videotape. 
Rib 
cage 
and 
abdominal 
volume 
changes 
were 
recorded 
with 
a 
computer-assisted 
respiratory 
inductance 
plethysmograph 
(Somnostar, 
Noninvasive 
Monitoring 
System, 
Miami 
Beach, 
FL, 
USA). 
Obstructive 
apnea 
was 
defined 
as 
the 
presence 
of 
chest/abdominal 
wall 
motion 
in 
the 
absence 
or 
decrease 
of 
airflow 
by 
more 
than 
80% 
of 
the 
preceding 
breath. 
Obstructive 
hypopnea 
was 
defined 
as 
a 
50–80% 
reduction 
in 
airflow, 
associated 
with 
oxygen 
desaturation 
=4%. 
All 
obstructive 
events 
of 
=2 
breaths’ 
duration 
were 
counted. 


Sleep 
staging 
was 
performed 
according 
to 
the 
rules 
of 
Rechtschaffen 
and 
Kales 
[19]. 
The 
definition 
of 
an 
arousal 
from 
sleep 
was 
based 
on 
the 
criteria 
published 
in 
the 
1992 
American 
Sleep 
Disorders 
Association 
Report 
on 
EEG 
arousals 
[20]. 
An 
arousal 
was 
defined 
as 
a 
shift 
in 
EEG 
frequency 
to 
alpha 
or 
theta 
for 
=3 
s. 
Before 
an 
arousal 
could 
be 
scored, 
the 
subject 
had 
to 
have 
been 
sleeping 
for 
a 
minimum 
of 
10 
s 
in 
the 
same 
or 
the 
contiguous 
sleep 
epoch. 
A 
minimum 
of 
10 
s 
of 
intervening 
sleep 
was 
necessary 
to 
score 
a 
second 
arousal. 
All 
polysomnograms 
were 
scored 
by 
the 
same 
sleep 
specialist 
to 
avoid 
interobserver 
variability. 


The 
following 
variables 
were 
generated 
from 
the 
polysomnograms 
and 
cardiorespiratory 
monitoring 
during 
sleep: 


& 
Study

Data 
Analyses 


Descriptive 
statistical 
analyses 
were 
performed 
to 
calculate 
the 
mean 
and 
standard 
deviation 
for 
baseline 
characteristics 
of 
all 
subjects. 
The 
precision 
of 
the 
mean 
was 
then 
calculated 
by 
dividing 
the 
standard 
deviation 
by 
the 
square 
root 
of 
the 
number 
of 
observations 
to 
obtain 
the 
standard 
error 
of 
the 
mean. 
Unless

was 
used 
to 
determine 
whether 
the

19 
subjects 
had 
a 
baseline 
and 
post-weight-loss 
assessment 
of 
sleep 
characteristics 
by 
an 
overnight 
polysomnogram. 
The 
mean 
age 
of 
these 
19 
subjects 
(12 
females, 
7 
males) 
was 
16.5±0.35 
years 
(Table 
1). 
All 
subjects 
had 
a 
BMI 
far 
greater 
than 
the 
95th 
percentile 
of 
BMI 
for 
age, 
with 
mean 
BMI 
of 
60.3± 


2.11 
kg/m2. 
The 
mean 
weight 
of 
this 
cohort 
was 
165.3± 
9.3 
kg 
and 
mean 
AHI 
was 
20.5±6.9/h. 
OSA 
was 
present 
in 
14 
of 
the 
19 
subjects 
(74%) 
and 
severe 
OSA 
(AHI>15/h) 
was 
diagnosed 
in 
5 
subjects 
(37%). 
The 
average 
interval 
between 
the 
baseline 
and 
repeat 
polysomnogram 
was 
0.91±0.16 
years, 
and 
average 
weight 
loss 
was 
66.4±8.8 
kg. 
At 
baseline 
(Table 
2), 
16% 
(2 
of 
12 
subjects) 
of 
severely 
obese 
adolescents 
had 
normal 
sleep 
efficiency 
(sleep 
efficiency>90%), 
whereas 
after 
weight 
loss, 
83% 
(10 
of 
12 
subjects) 
had 
normal 
sleep 
efficiency. 
Surgical 
weight 
loss 
resulted 
in 
increased 
sleep 
efficiency 
(80.2% 
vs 
73.1%, 
p=0.01), 
reduced 
time 
in 
stage 
1 
sleep 
(7.2% 
vs 
3.7%, 
p=0.04), 
and 
reduced 
arousal 
index 
(7.6± 
0.6/h 
vs 
11.3±1.2, 
p=0.01). 
One 
patient 
who 
had 
an 
extreme 
value 
of 
arousal 
index 
(82.4 
episodes/hour) 
was 
identified 
as 
an 
outlier 
by 
Grubbs 
test 
( 
p<0.05), 
and 
this 
patient 
was 
excluded. 
In 
agreement 
with 
our 
prior 
report 
[16], 
the 
AHI 
of 
20.5±6.9/h 
significantly 
improved 
to 
1.9± 
0.6/h 
following 
surgical 
weight 
loss 
( 
p=0.01).

addressing 
the 
effect 
of 
marked 
weight 
loss 
on 
sleep 
architecture 
in 
an 
exclusively 
pediatric

Our

with 
those 
of

in 
adults 
[14]. 
Our 
study 
findings 
are 
therefore 
particularly 
significant 
for 
the 
extremely 
obese 
pediatric 
subjects 
in 
whom 
an 
increased 
prevalence 
of 
mood 
disorders 
[17] 
has 
been 
reported. 


Excessive 
daytime 
sleepiness 
is 
a 
common 
symptom 
in 
obese 
subjects 
and 
those 
with 
OSA 
[24]. 
In 
obese 
adults 
with 
OSA, 
excessive 
daytime 
sleepiness 
has 
been 
strongly 
correlated 
with 
BMI, 
whereas 
OSA 
was 
assessed 
as 
a 
minor 
contributor 
to 
excessive 
daytime 
sleepiness 
[25]. 
Although 
the 
current 
study 
did 
not 
incorporate 
the 
assessment 
of 
excessive 
daytime 
sleepiness, 
there 
are 
several 
biologically 
plausible 
mechanisms 
through 
which 
our 
study 
patients 
could 
experience 
a 
resolution 
of 
their 
excessive 
daytime 
sleepiness. 
One 
of 
these 
mechanisms 
is 
through 
correction 
of 
sleep 
fragmentation, 
which 
has 
been 
proposed 
as 
the 
primary 
causal 
factor 
for 
excessive 
daytime 
sleepiness 
[26]. 
Another 
possible 
mechanism 
is 
the 
reduction 
of 
inflammatory 
cytokines 
reported 
with 
bariatric 
surgical 
weight 
loss 
[27]. 
There 
is 
evidence 
that 
the 
inflammatory 
cytokines 
tumor 
necrosis 
factor-a, 
interleukin 
1ß, 
and 
interleukin-6 
play 
a 
role 
in 
physiological 
sleep 
regulation 
[25]. 
Increased 
secretion 
or 
exogenous 
administration 
of 
these 
hormones 
is 
associated 
with 
sleepiness 
and 
fatigue. 


Bariatric 
surgery 
typically 
results 
in 
substantial 
weight 
loss 
and, 
as 
such, 
has 
been 
shown 
to 
have 
a 
dramatic 
effect 
on 
obesity-related 
comorbidities 
[27]. 
Among 
obese 
patients, 
OSA 
is 
an 
independent 
risk 
factor 
for 
metabolic 
and 
cardiovascular 
morbidity 
[28, 
29]. 
Sleep 
fragmentation, 
resulting 
in 
increased 
sympathetic 
activation 
and 
vascular 
endothelial 
dysfunction, 
has 
been 
proposed 
as 
the 
pathophysiologic 
basis 
for 
this 
increased 
risk 
[29]. 
Punjabi 
et 
al. 
reported 
a 
significant 
association 
between 
measures 
of 
insulin 
resistance 
(HOMA 
index) 
and 
sleep 
fragmentation 
(arousal 
index) 
[30]. 
Also, 
continuous 
positive 
airway 


pressure, 
which 
decreases 
sleep 
fragmentation, 
reportedly 
decreases 
sympathetic 
discharge 
[31, 
32] 
and 
improves 
vascular 
endothelial 
dysfunction 
[33]. 
Furthermore, 
the 
use 
of 
continuous 
positive 
airway 
pressure 
results 
in 
a 
decrease 
in 
insulin 
resistance 
and 
hyperglycemia 
in 
patients 
with 
OSA 
[34]. 
Overall, 
these 
studies 
suggest 
that 
the 
improvement 
in 
sleep 
fragmentation 
with 
surgical 
weight 
loss 
can 
play 
a 
role 
in 
the 
resolution 
of 
metabolic 
and 
cardiovascular 
morbidity. 


This 
study 
has 
some 
limitations. 
One 
limitation 
is 
the 
retrospective 
study 
design, 
which 
prevents 
standardization 
of 
the 
time 
interval 
between 
baseline 
and 
post-weight-loss 
polysomnograms. 
Another 
limitation 
is 
the 
small 
sample 
size 
that 
precludes 
multivariate 
analyses 
to 
assess, 
for 
example, 
the 
independent 
contribution 
of 
change 
in 
obesity 
and 
change 
in 
OSA 
severity 
to 
the 
change 
in 
sleep 
architecture 
and 
also 
prevents 
evaluation 
of 
the 
clinical 
effect 
of 
the 
observed 
changes 
in 
sleep 
architecture. 
However, 
these 
limitations 
notwithstanding, 
the 
significant 
effects 
of 
the 
weight 
loss 
intervention 
on 
sleep 
fragmentation 
suggest 
the 
need 
for 
more 
research 
to 
both 
confirm 
these 
observations 
and 
to 
begin 
to 
elucidate 
mechanisms 
responsible 
for 
the 
improved 
sleep 
hygiene 
with 
surgical 
weight 
loss. 


Conclusion 


Our 
data 
demonstrate 
a 
marked 
improvement 
in 
sleep 
efficiency 
and 
sleep 
fragmentation 
with 
surgical 
weight 
loss. 
Given 
the 
emerging 
evidence 
that 
surgical 
weight 
loss 
results 
in 
resolution 
of 
obesity-associated 
psychosocial, 
metabolic, 
and 
cardiovascular 
morbidity, 
these 
results 
suggest 
that 
correction 
of 
sleep 
fragmentation 
could 
be 
an 
important 
but 
as-yet 
underappreciated 
factor 
influencing 
changes 
in 
these 
other 
major 
comorbidities 
of 
obesity.
