Abstract 

Background: The current study examined the relationships between academic achievement, sleep, temperament and demographic-historical 
data in school-age children. 
Methods: Teachers were asked to fill out the teacher temperament questionnaire and a form for school achievement, while mothers filled out a 
demographic-historical form and the sleep disturbance scale for children (SDSC), a 26-item questionnaire that consisted of six factors: 
difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep (DIMS), sleep breathing disorders (SBD), arousal disorders (DA), sleep–wake transition 
disorders (SWTD), disorders of excessive somnolence (DOES), sleep hyperhydrosis (SHY). 


From a sample of 380 school children, 264 (70%) were suitable for the analyses (141 M and 123 F aged 8–11 years, mean 9.6 years). A 
school achievement index (SAI) was derived, summing up four items (reading ability, reading comprehension, mathematics, executive 
ability) of the teacher form for school achievement. 
Results: SAI mean for the total sample was 11.1 (SDZ2.8). A significant gender difference was found: females have higher SAI than males. 
The analysis of the demographic-historical form showed that only two factors appeared to affect SAI score: enuresis and the low educational 
level of the mother. The pattern of correlations showed that (a) the SAI was negatively related to the SDSC total score, in particular to DIMS 
and DOES sub-factors, and (b) the SAI was significantly and positively correlated with the temperamental traits of task-orientation and 
personal–social flexibility. A multiple stepwise regression analysis showed that the temperamental traits task-orientation and personal–social 
flexibility are the most predictive factors for SAI while the mother’s educational level and the SDSC total score, although they contributed 
significantly to the prediction of SAI, accounted for only a small portion of variance. 
Conclusions: Temperament and sleep are important factors influencing school achievement, and their assessment could help to identify 
children at risk regarding school achievement.

1. Introduction 
Several studies have analysed the relationships 
between sleep and cognitive performance in adult 
populations [1,2] and, recently, a number of studies 
have been carried out in school-age children, mainly in

those with snoring or sleep-disordered breathing [3–8].A 
meta-analysis study on sleep deprivation and performance 
in adults showed that sleep deprivation, either total or 
partial, has a clearly negative effect on cognitive and 
physical performance [9]. Since studies on sleep 
deprivation in children are very rare [10,11],the 
correlation between learning and sleep are often analysed 
through the alterations of the macrostructure of sleep, 
reporting mainly a reduction of REM sleep and/or a 
longer REM latency in mentally retarded subjects, in 
attention-deficit disorders or reading-disabled children, as 


O. Bruni et al. / Sleep Medicine 7 (2006) 43–48 
well as an increase of REM sleep in children or 
adolescents after an intensive learning session [12–14]. 

A review on the effects of sleep loss or disruption on 
children’s cognitive function based on a wide range of 
clinical and observational data showed that inadequate sleep 
results in tiredness, difficulties with focused attention, low 
threshold to express negative affect (irritability and easy 
frustration), and difficulty in modulating impulses and 
emotions [15]. Sleep manipulation, such as modest sleep 
restriction or extension, leads to significant differential 
effects on children’s neurobehavioral functioning [16]. 

Apart from sleep, other factors that could have a strong 
influence on neurobehavioral functioning and school 
achievement are the temperamental traits [17–20]. Temperament 
appears to influence a child’s ability to use what 
he knows and may facilitate or impede academic 
performance by “setting the stage” for the acquisition of 
new learning, through appropriate modulation of activity, 
persistence and adaptive responses to new situations [21]. 
Students in school must modify and direct their energies and 
activity levels appropriately and must respond adaptively 
and flexibly to challenging instructional demands. Some can 
respond successfully to such demands, and others give up 
early, while others ‘hang in’ until projects are finished. 
These differences are in part related to individual 
differences in temperament. 

Since no detailed research was available on the 
relationships between both sleep and temperament and 
academic achievement, we have designed a study to identify 
paths that significantly predict school achievement from 
temperamental and sleep variables and demographic-
historical data. 

2. Methods 
2.1. Participants and procedure 
Three hundred and eighty children (197 M, 183 F, mean 
age 9.2 years) took part in the study. These children came 
from a public primary school of the urban area of Rome. 
The goal and the design of the study were explained during a 
meeting with parents and teachers. It was explained that, for 
each student, three questionnaires should be compiled: one 
to be filled out by the parents and two by the teachers. Since 
each class has three teachers, we requested that at least two 
of them filled out the questionnaires together. Teachers 
distributed a questionnaire to each student together with the 
joint letters from the headmaster and from the researchers to 
the parents. The forms were distributed to the parents and 
collected by the teachers. 

Parents filled out the questionnaire at their home. 
Teachers were completely blind to parents’ rating and 
vice versa. 

2.2. Instruments 
2.2.1. Teacher ratings 
Teachers were asked to fill out two different types of 
questionnaires: the teacher temperament questionnaire [22] 
and a form to evaluate academic achievement. 

The teacher temperament questionnaire (TTQ) is a 23item 
scale developed to assess eight temperamental 
dimensions, and it derived from a more extensive version 
comprising 64 items [23]. In this form of the TTQ the 
teacher is asked to rate each item on a six-point scale from 
‘hardly ever’ to ‘almost always’. The questionnaire 
analysed eight dimensions that defined temperament: 
activity, approach/withdrawal, adaptability, intensity of 
response, mood, persistence, distractibility, threshold of 
response). We assessed the psychometric properties of the 
Italian version of the TTQ on an Italian sample of 337 
school-aged children [24]. According to Keogh [21,22], 
three reliable temperamental factors were identified: (1) 
task-orientation (defined by nine items pertaining to the 
following dimensions: activity, distractibility and persistence), 
with higher scores indicating a higher capability to 
focus attention and ability to persist in a determinate 
behavior in order to reach a goal (reliability in the normative 
Italian sampleZ.84; in our sample, alphaZ.92); (2) 
personal–social flexibility (defined by eight items pertaining 
to the following dimensions: adaptability, approach/withdrawal, 
positive mood), with higher scores indicating 
greater adaptability and social abilities (reliability in the 
normative Italian sampleZ.84; in our sample, alphaZ.90); 

(3) reactivity (defined by six items pertaining to the 
following dimensions: intensity, threshold and negative 
mood), with higher scores referring to a greater emotional 
reactivity (reliability in the normative Italian sampleZ.62; 
in our sample, alphaZ.65). 
Teacher school achievement form. The school achievement 
form, developed by the authors, is composed of six 
items and each response was given on a four-point Likert 
scale, ranging from ‘severe difficulties’ to ‘above the 
average’. The six items refer to different aspects relevant 
to school achievement (reading ability, reading comprehension, 
mathematics, executive ability, interest, attention). 

2.2.2. Parental ratings 
Parents were asked to fill out a questionnaire (sleep 
disturbance scale for children (SDSC)) (see Appendix) 
designed to assess a variety of sleep-related behaviors in 
childhood and adolescence [25]. 

The sleep disturbance scale for children (SDSC). The 
questionnaire assessed sleep behavior and disturbances 
during the previous six months and was constituted by 26 
items in a Likert-type scale with values 1–5. The SDSC 
consisted of six factors which represented the most common 
areas of sleep disorders in childhood and adolescence: 
difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep (DIMS), 
sleep breathing disorders (SBD), arousal disorders (DA), 


O. Bruni et al. / Sleep Medicine 7 (2006) 43–48 
sleep–wake transition disorders (SWTD), disorders of 
excessive somnolence (DOES), sleep hyperhydrosis (SHY). 

Demographic-historical form. Mothers were asked to fill 
out a form on demographic data about child, family 
composition, parents’ education and professional activities, 
as well as clinical data about pregnancy, delivery and 
medical history of the child, with specific questions 
regarding pathologies that could affect sleep: birth weight, 
length of gestation, pregnancy, delivery, condition at birth, 
feeding method, co-sleeping, birth order, report of sleep 
problems in infancy, allergy to cow’s milk, colic during the 
first months, recurrent adenotonsillitis, asthma or allergic 
rhinitis or bronchitis, food allergy, enuresis. 

2.3. Data analysis 
Descriptive statistics were computed for all the relevant 
factors of the study. Teachers’ evaluations were analysed 
computing multiple squared correlations and Cronbach 
alpha index of internal consistency. Differences in school 
achievement were analysed by means of analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) designs (significance levelZ.05). In 
order to avoid an increase of type I error, Bonferroni 
correction for the multiple comparisons was applied. 

The relationships between sleep quality dimensions, 
achievement and temperament were analysed, computing 
Pearson correlation coefficients and by means of a linear 
regression analysis. Statistical analyses were conducted 
with SPSS 10 Software, a statistical package of SPSS Inc. 

3. Results 
Of the 380 questionnaires, for 42 children (11%) both 
parental and teacher questionnaires were not returned. 
Evaluations of 74 (19%) children were excluded because 
questionnaires were filled out either only by parents or only 
by teachers or because they contain multiple missing values. 

Therefore, 264 questionnaires (70%) were suitable for 
the analyses. The sample was composed of 141 males and 
123 females aged 8–11 years (mean 9.07 years; SDZ.87). 
Descriptive statistics for child history variables and school 
achievement are reported in Table 1. 

Among the teachers’ evaluations, the highest prevalence 
(19.8%) of severe difficulties was found for failure in 
attention, followed by ability in logic-mathematics, reading 
comprehension and executive ability. Considering the 
conceptual overlapping between attention and interest 
items of the teacher school achievement form and some 
temperamental traits (mainly, the distractibility), we 
computed a school achievement index (SAI) summing up 
only four (reading ability, reading comprehension, mathematics, 
executive ability) of the six items in order to not 
inflate the correlations. The four items were highly 
correlated with each other (mean of multiple square 
correlations was 0.68) and the reliability of the SAI was

high [Cronbach alphaZ0.91]. The school achievement 
index (SAI) was used in the following analyses. 

SAI mean for the total sample was 11.1 (SD Z2.8). A 
significant gender difference was found [F(1,260)Z4.33; PZ 
0.04]: females (meanZ11.5; SDZ2.8) have higher SAI 
than males (meanZ10.7; SDZ2.8). 

Most of the family-related factors (the presence of 
brothers/sisters, work status, etc. of the father and mother) 
and medical/historical factors (pregnancy difficulty; developmental 
diseases, etc.) assessed did not influence the SAI. 
Among these variables, only two factors appeared to affect 
SAI scores: enuresis and the educational level of the mother. 
Thus, 23 parents (8.7%) reported that their children 
presented enuresis: these 23 children obtained significantly 
lower SAI scores (meanZ9.6; SDZ3.1) than the other 
children [meanZ11.2; SDZ2.7; F(1,260)Z7.0; PZ.008]. 

As for the significant effect of the mother’s educational 
level [F(1,260)Z11.2; P!.001], post hoc comparison 
evidenced that children whose mother had a college degree 
obtained higher SAI scores (meanZ12.1; SDZ2.4) than 
children whose mother had a secondary (meanZ11.0; SDZ 
2.7; Bonferroni test prob!.05) or primary school degree 
(meanZ9.7; SDZ3.2, Bonferroni test prob!.05). 

Mean of the total scores of the SDSC compiled by the 
parents was 36.85 (SDZ7.5), which is comparable with 
the score obtained in the validation sample [25]. The 
relationship between temperamental dimensions, SAI, and 
SDSC total scores is reported in Table 2.

The pattern of correlations showed the following: 

(a) the SAI was negatively related to the SDSC total score, 
indicating inverse relationship between school 
achievement and sleep disturbances. Correlation 
analyses evidenced that SAI was significantly related 
only with DIMS (rZK.17; PZ.007) and DOES 
(rZK.16; PZ.009) sub-factors of the SDSC; 
(b) the SAI was significantly and positively correlated with 
task-orientation and personal – social flexibility; 
(c) lower 
but statistically significant correlations were 
observed between the SDSC total score and the 
temperament traits of task-orientation (negative correlation) 
and reactivity. 
In order to evaluate the predictive value of sleep and 
temperament on SAI score, a multiple stepwise regression 
was performed, including the following variables: the three 
temperamental dimensions of the TTQ (task-orientation, 
personal–social flexibility and reactivity), the SDSC total 
score and the variables that emerged to be relevant in the bivariate 
analysis reported above (gender, enuresis, and the 
mother’s educational level). The results of the regression 
analysis are summarised in Table 3. The equation explained 
56.6% of the variance of SAI. Temperamental dimensions 
of task-orientation and social flexibility are the most 
predictive factors for SAI, accounting for about 51% of 
the total variance. The mother’s educational level and the 
SDSC total score entered into the equation contributed 
significantly to the prediction of SAI, even if they accounted 
for a little portion of variance. 

4. Discussion 
The results of the present study should be considered with 
some cautions: (1) data were derived from questionnaires; (2) 
the high correlation between achievement scales and 
temperament could be linked to the fact that teachers filled 
out the two questionnaires; and (3) parents’ reports of sleep 
behavior may not be as accurate as data obtained by an 
objective method (i.e. polysomnography or actigraphic 
recordings). Notwithstanding these limitations, our data 
represent the first attempt to evaluate both sleep and 
temperament as variables involved in academic achievement. 

Concerning demographic-historical factors, our study 
confirmed the predictive value of low maternal education 

and enuresis according to the literature: low maternal 
education and enuresis were two of the several factors 
associated with increased risk of grade retention in addition 
to poverty, male gender, deafness, speech defects, and 
exposure to household smoking [31]. Enuresis was 
associated with increased risk of learning disabilities and 
impaired school achievement in normal children [32]; the 
prevalence of academic underachievement was 3.5 times 
higher among enuretic children compared to those without 
enuresis. 

We found an inverse relationship between school 
achievement index and SDSC total score that is in line 
with the reports on the effect of sleep loss/deprivation on 
performance requiring attention and concentration [9]. The 
effects of insufficient sleep or sleep loss on academic 
performances could be greater than hypothesised since there 
is increasing evidence that chronic sleep deprivation in 
children probably begins at an early age [27,28] and 
becomes evident in school age [29]. The consequences of 
this chronic sleep deprivation could have a great impact on 
school performance. Recent studies examined the associations 
between sleep parameters objectively measured by 
actigraphy and neurobehavioral functioning (NBF) in 
school-age children [30,34]; children with fragmented 
sleep were characterised by lower performance on NBF 
measures, particularly those associated with more complex 
tasks such as a continuous performance test and a symbol-
digit substitution test. These findings were in agreement 
with our data showing that the DIMS and DOES sub-factors 
displayed a significant negative relationship with SAI. On 
the other hand, several studies demonstrated a relationship 
between sleep-related obstructive disorders and decreased 
cognitive performances [3–8,35–37], but our data failed to 
support a relationship between SAI and the SBD sub-factor 
in a non-clinical population. 

Considering sleep and temperament, we found a low but 
statistically significant correlation between the SDSC total 
score and the temperament traits of task-orientation 
(negative correlation) and reactivity. 

It is often difficult to determine whether disturbed sleep 
was caused initially by a specific temperament trait or by a 
parental behaviour (in response to a trait or independently) 
because interactive effects always evolve. On the other hand, 
the sleep deficit could cause either impairment of learning, 
lack of concentration, difficulty maintaining focused attention 
and fatigue that indirectly trigger a chemically

Temperamental traits such as task-orientation (activity, Although we know that multiple risk factors have 
persistence and distractibility) and personal–social flexibility cumulative effects in increasing a child’s risk of failure in
