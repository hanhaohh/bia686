Objectives: To determine the impact of adenotonsillectomy 
on quality of life (QOL) in children with 
obstructive sleep disorders (OSDs) before and after 
surgery. 

Design: Prospective, observational, before-and-after trial. 

Setting: Seven tertiary pediatric otolaryngology practices. 


Patients: Convenience sample of 101 children (mean 
age, 6.2 years) with adenotonsillar hypertrophy and OSD 
scheduled for adenotonsillectomy. 

Intervention: Adenotonsillectomy was performed in 
children for OSDs. Quality of life was assessed using the 
Obstructive Sleep Disorders–6 survey, a validated instrument 
for detecting QOL change in children with OSDs. 
Surveys were completed at the initial office visit (visit 1), 
the day of surgery (visit 2), and at the postoperative office 
visit (visit 3). Physical characteristics were assessed 
using tonsillar and orocraniofacial scales (visit 1). Satisfaction 
with health care decisions was assessed using 

the Satisfaction With Decision and Satisfaction With Office 
Visit scales (visit 1). 

Main Outcome Measures: Short-term changes in QOL 
before (visits 1 and 2) and after (visits 2 and 3) surgery. 

Results: Changes in QOL before surgery were trivial or 
small, and smaller than changes after surgery (mean 
change score, 0.18 vs 2.3; P.001). Large, moderate, and 
small improvements in QOL were seen in 74.5%, 6.1%, 
and 7.1% of children, respectively. Sleep disturbance, caregiver 
concern, and physical suffering were the most improved 
domains, although significant changes also occurred 
for speech and swallowing problems, emotional 
disturbance, and activity limitations. Five percent of children 
had poorer QOL after surgery, but no predictive factors 
were identified. 

Conclusion: Adenotonsillectomy produces large improvements 
in at least short-term QOL in most children 
with OSDs.

HE TERM obstructive sleep disorders 
(OSDs) refers to the 
spectrum of sleep-disordered 
breathing that is severe 
enough to cause clinical 
symptoms. This includes children 
with upper airway resistance syndrome 
(UARS), in which the respiratory distress 
index is often normal on standard polysomnographic 
testing, and children with 
obstructive sleep apnea. The prevalence 
of sleep-disordered breathing in children 
is not exactly known but may approach 
11%.1 The impact of OSDs on child functioning 
has been extensively documented. 
Children with OSDs may manifest an increase 
in total sleep time, nonspecific behavioral 
difficulties, hyperactivity, irritability, 
bed-wetting, and morning headaches. 
A more severe manifestation is failure to 
thrive, and, in general, untreated children 

are at risk for cardiovascular complications. 
Daytime sleepiness and obese body 
habitus, common features in adult sleep 
apnea, are frequently absent. The most common 
cause of OSDs in children is adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy, and adenotonsillectomy 
is a curative procedure in most cases.2-5 

Anecdotal evidence for the success of 
this procedure in improving patient symptoms, 
health, and well-being is abundant; 
however, there have been no studies to date, 
to our knowledge, that document improvement 
in health-related quality of life (QOL) 
after adenotonsillectomy. In the context 
of OSDs, QOL describes the net consequences 
of sleep-disordered breathing on the 
child’s daily activities, physical symptoms, 
social interactions, and emotional wellbeing. 
The effect of adenotonsillectomy on 
these areas of functioning is important information 
for parents considering the pro

PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS 

This study was conducted at 7 tertiary care pediatric otolaryngology 
practices across the United States. The study 
protocol received approval from the institutional review 
board at each site. Informed consent for enrollment in the 
study was obtained from each caregiver. 

The study protocol was modeled after a recent study7 
that examined QOL improvement after tympanostomy tube 
placement. Eligible participants comprised a convenience 
sample of caregivers of patients aged 2 to 12 years undergoing 
adenotonsillectomy for OSDs. Participants were required 
to be English speaking to avoid semantic issues in interpretation 
of the domains and symptom clusters.8 Caregivers 
were excluded if their child had other adenotonsillar pathologic 
findings or if another procedure was to be performed 
on the same day. Demographic data (age and sex) and tonsillar 
size were recorded for all patients, including those whose 
caregivers refused enrollment or dropped out of the study. 
Children were diagnosed as having OSDs by the attending 
pediatric otolaryngologist based on findings from a combination 
of any of the following modalities, as determined by 
the standard clinical practice of the attending physician: history, 
physical examination, lateral neck radiograph, nasopharyngoscopy, 
sleep audiotape, and polysomnographic study. 

Data were collected at 3 times during the perioperative 
care of the child: at the initial visit (visit 1), at the day 
of surgery (visit 2), and at the postoperative visit (visit 3). 

Before surgery, the physician completed a physical assessment 
form that documented the method of diagnosis 

(history, physical examination, nasopharyngoscopy, lateral 
radiograph, sleep audiotape, or sleep study), OSD symptoms 
(snoring, gasping, restless sleep, apneas, night 
terrors, daytime somnolence, daytime hyperactivity, enuresis, 
nocturnal sweating, and morning headaches), and 
physical examination findings, including degree of tonsillar 
obstruction (absent, 0%-25%, 26%-50%, 51%-75%, 
and 76%-100%), and a clinical orocraniofacial (OCF) scale.9 
High scores on the OCF scale correlate with a diagnosis of 
sleep-disordered breathing (UARS and obstructive sleep 
apnea).9 The OCF characteristics included chin size (0-3, 
wide to small and triangular), steepness of mandibular plane 
(0-3, horizontal to steep), position of maxilla vs mandible 
(0-4, prognathic to significant retrognathia), height of hard 
palate (0-2, low placed to high placed), shape of face (0-3, 
square to long), length of soft palate (0-2, short to long), 
and intermolar width (0-2, wide to narrow). 

Changes in QOL were determined by administration 
of the 6-item, health-related instrument for OSD, the Obstructive 
Sleep Disorders–6 survey (OSD-6), a validated survey 
for assessing health-related QOL in OSDs7 (Figure 1). 
The OSD-6 is composed of 6 domains that reflect functioning 
of the child regarding (1) physical suffering, (2) 
sleep disturbance, (3) speech and swallowing difficulties, 

(4) emotional distress, (5) activity limitations, and (6) level 
of concern of the caregiver relating to the patient’s sleep 
disorder and associated symptoms. Each domain is represented 
by a question designed to reflect the global impact 
of an OSD-related symptom cluster on an individual child 
(Figure 1). Caregivers rated the domains on a scale from 0 
(“no problem”)to6(“could not be worse”) based on how 
cedure for their child and is evidence of the procedure’s 
effectiveness that can be presented to third-party payers in 
support of decisions for surgery. 

A 6-item, disease-specific QOL instrument was recently 
validated as a measure for assessing change in patients 
with OSDs who undergo adenotonsillectomy.6 Data 
from the validation study suggested large improvements 
in QOL for most children undergoing the procedure. 
This study was designed to document the improvements 
in QOL using the validated instrument in a larger 
number of children from geographically diverse regions 
of the United States. 

RESULTS 
A total of 115 caregivers meeting the eligibility criteria 
were enrolled in the study; 14 were lost to follow-up and 
were thus excluded. Sampling bias was assessed to ensure 
that the enrolled population was representative of 
those eligible. Mean preoperative domain and survey 
scores, as well as physical examination variables, were 
compared between patients who completed the postoperative 
survey and those who did not. There were no differences 
in demographics, physical examination variables, 
or mean survey scores from visits 1 and 2. 
Demographic data, physical examination findings, and 
mean survey and domain scores were also compared by 
site and were not significantly different. Patient age was 

6.2 (2.5) years. Forty-six percent of patients were girls 
and 54% were boys. Forty-two patients (41.6%) were from 
the northeastern United States, 27 (26.7%) were from the 
south, 19 (18.8%) were from the west, and 13 (12.9%) 
were from the central part of the country. 

Sleep symptoms were documented by the examining 
attending physician (Table 1). All patients from whom 
data were obtained were snorers, and 91.8% had restless 
sleep. Only a small percentage of children had enuresis 
(13.4%), nocturnal sweating (7.2%), or morning headaches 
(3.1%). Physical characteristics, including tonsil size 
(Table 2) and OCF characteristics (Table 3), were also 
rated by the physician. Tonsil size was 3.4 (0.65). Orocraniofacial 
scores were tabulated and then divided into low, 
medium, and high scores by 33rd percentiles. The scores 
were 7.7 (1.3) in the lowest-scoring group (n=37), 10.5 

(0.51) in the mid-scoring group (n=27), and 13.6 (1.5) in 
the high-scoring group (n=35). 
In 55 (54.5%) of 101 patients, diagnosis was based 
on history and physical examination alone; an additional 
diagnostic test was used in the remainder. Nasopharyngoscopy 
was performed in 10 patients (9.9%), and 
lateral neck films were taken in 6 (5.9%). Sleep audiotapes 
were obtained in 25 patients (24.8%); data from 
these audiotapes were not objectively rated. Sleep studies 
were obtained in 8 patients (7.9%). Of these 8 patients, 
the severity of obstructive sleep apnea was graded 
as mild in 50% and moderate in 50%. A respiratory distress 
index was available for 6 of these patients (mean, 

6.7 [3.1]).

All caregivers easily self-administered the questionnaire 
in several minutes after a brief explanation of its 
contents. The distribution of baseline domain scores is 
shown in Figure 2. Physical suffering, sleep disturbance, 
and speech and swallowing difficulties were classified 
as moderate or greater problems (score of 3) for 
82.1%, 95.0%, and 62.4% of patients, respectively; 52.5% 
of caregivers rated their level of concern over their child’s 
sleep disturbance in the 2 most severe categories (“very 
much” and “could not be worse”), and 77% rated their 
level of concern as a moderate or worse problem. Median 
baseline survey responses for the 101 caregivers are 
given in Table 4. Sleep disturbance (score, 4.6 [1.1]), 
physical suffering (score, 3.9 [1.3]), and caregiver concern 
(score, 3.8 [1.9]) were the highest-rated items, 
whereas activity limitations (score, 1.5 [1.6]) were rated 
as the least affected. 

At the initial visit, parents also completed the Satisfaction 
With Decision Scale and the Satisfaction With 
Office Visit Scale, validated measures of outpatient satisfaction. 
Overall, parents were satisfied with their decision 
to pursue surgery for their child’s OSDs (Table 5) 
and were very satisfied with their office visit experience 
(Table 6). 

Changes in QOL were determined by measuring the 
differences in scores between consecutive visits. Preoperative 
change in QOL was determined by the change in scores 
between visits 1 and 2, and postoperative change in QOL 
was determined by the change in score between visits 2 and 

3. Patients were determined to have a valid change score if 
the time between surgery (visit 2) and the postoperative 
visit (visit 3) was 21 days or longer. This prevented sampling 
of symptoms in the recovery period, which could distort 
QOL ratings. Ninety-eight (97.0%) of 101 patients were 
determined to have valid change scores. Time between visits 
1 and 2 was 31.0 (25.9) days (range, 4-162 days) and 
between visits 2 and 3 was 35.7 (14.8) days (range, 21-98 
days) for these patients. 
The change score before surgery (visit 1 to visit 2) was 

0.18 (95% CI, 0-37), indicating trivial change overall. This 
change was not significantly different than zero (t97=1.91; 
P=.06). Before surgery, 42 (42.9%) of 98 patients had trivial 
or small changes in QOL, whereas 16 (16.3%) had moderate 
or large changes in QOL. Forty patients (40.8%) had 
worsening of their QOL before surgery. The change score 
after surgery (visit 2 to visit 3) was 2.3 (95% CI, 2.1-2.6), 
which indicates a large improvement in QOL (t97=15.7; 
P.001). After surgery, 73 patients (74.5%) demonstrated 
a large degree of improvement in QOL (change score 
1.5), 6 (6.1%) had a moderate improvement, 7 (7.1%) 
had a small improvement, and 7 (7.1%) had a trivial improvement. 
In addition, 5 patients (5.1%) had a worsening 
of their QOL after surgery: 1 (1.0%) to a large extent, 
2 (2.0%) to a moderate extent, and 2 (2.0%) to a small 
extent. The differences in degree of clinical change before 
and after surgery were significant (24=87.2; P.001). 
Change scores were converted into a measure of 
effect size, the SRM, to facilitate interpretation of results

toms. Tonsil obstruction greater than 75% was the only 
factor predictive of poorer QOL before surgery (P=.004). 

We performed a variety of statistical tests to discern 
whether longer follow-up was related to change in 
QOL score because some prospective studies have indicated 
that QOL scores may change after surgery. Although 
follow-up ranged from 21 to 98 days, mean follow-
up was 35.7 (14.8) days (median, 30 days). Note that 
75% of patients were followed for 41 days or less; 90% 
were followed for 55 days or less. There were only 3 extreme 
outliers: 1 patient at 76 days and 1 each at 97 and 
98 days. Linear regression analysis measuring any linear 
relationship between length of follow-up and improved 
QOL found no such relationship (r=0.13; P=.21). 
In addition, using a standard t test, we divided the group 
into 2 groups: (1) 30 days or less of follow-up and (2) 
more than 30 days of follow-up. The difference in survey 
change score was statistically significant, with a change 
of 1.97 (1.6) (n=50) vs 2.74 (1.24) (n=48) for the 2 
groups, respectively (P.01). However, this 0.77 difference 
represents a small difference in QOL change score 
as defined by Juniper et al.10 We also calculated the rate 
of change of QOL change scores by taking the change 
scores and dividing by the length of follow-up. This cal


culation yields a “QOL improvement score per patient-
month.” We then compared the average rates for the 2 
groups and found that the mean rate of improvement was 
slightly higher in the group with 30 days or less of follow-
up compared with the group with more than 30 days 
of follow-up: 2.24 (1.8) vs 1.97 (0.99); however, this difference 
was not statistically significant (P=.35). 

COMMENT 
As decisions concerning resource allocation become 
increasingly stringent, it is important to understand the 
personal impact of diseases and their treatments beyond 
the standard medical morbidity or functional limitations 
so that this can be incorporated into the decision-
making process. Procedures or treatments that have an 
impact on patient functioning above and beyond laboratory 
value improvements should be recognized. This 
study is the first, to our knowledge, to define QOL 
changes in children who undergo adenotonsillectomy 
for an OSD. We hope that this information will be helpful 
for clinicians to provide to parents who are considering 
the procedure for their child. Studies such as this 
will provide evidence for the effectiveness of this proce-

General health status instruments enable comparisons 
of health status impact between diseases. A recent 
study using the Child Health Questionnaire, a general 
instrument of child health-related QOL, reported that the 
impact of adenotonsillar disease (recurrent infection and 
adenotonsillar hypertrophy) on child QOL is similar to 
that of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.12 Disease-specific 
instruments such as the OSD-6 and others12-14 focus on 
areas of function that pertain to a particular disease or 
condition and are used to describe the impact of disease 
on individuals above and beyond the usual biomedical 
variables used to assess severity of the particular disease 
or condition. 

The OSD-6 is a disease-specific instrument that has 
been shown to be of use as an evaluative measure, showing 
changes in QOL before and after an intervention (eg, 
adenotonsillectomy). In the present study, almost 90% of 
all children undergoing the procedure had improvements 
in QOL after surgery. Seventy-five percent had large im

provements, and an additional 6% had moderate improvements 
in child QOL. Findings of this magnitude indicate 
the benefit of adenotonsillectomy for most children with 
OSDs. These findings support the objective improvements 
that are seen in follow-up polysomnographic studies 
and symptom questionnaires2-4,15 and quantify the subjective 
improvements that occur after the procedure. 

As is standard in most outcome studies, this study was 
conducted using information obtained in routine clinical 
practice. Sleep studies were not obtained routinely and in 
fact were performed on only 8% of patients. This finding 
concurs with usual clinical practice because most adenotonsillectomies 
are performed without preoperative polysomnographic 
testing unless there are special circumstances.
16,17 Sleep studies that are available to most 
practitioners are not considered diagnostic of the spectrum 
of OSDs because of the lack of esophageal pressure 
monitoring and the subsequent inability to diagnose 
UARS.1,9,18,19 Inability to diagnose UARS would lead to the 
misdiagnosis of children with significant sleep fragmentation.
1 A recent validation study14 of an OSD survey showed 
a statistically significant but only fair correlation with respiratory 
distress indices obtained from nap studies. This 
finding is likely because (1) a significant proportion of children 
with problematic sleep-disordered breathing have normal 
sleep study findings and (2) nap studies have been validated 
for use in adults only,20 and their sensitivity in 
detecting sleep-disordered breathing in children is so far 
undemonstrated, to our knowledge. Clearly, accurate diagnosis 
of the full spectrum of OSDs in children is still in 
evolution. However, as stated previously by others21 in reference 
to children with “normal” polysomnograms who underwent 
adenotonsillectomy subsequently, “otolaryngologists 
with good clinical sense decided to pursue the 
appropriate course of action despite a normal test.” As the 
diagnostic process evolves for determining who will benefit 
from surgery in a readily available and reliable manner, 
it is helpful to know that most children with compelling 
history and physical examination findings of OSDs who 
are selected for surgery will have large improvements in 
their QOL. In fact, given that 75% of children had large improvements 
and 88% had some degree of improvement in 
QOL after adenotonsillectomy, the debate over the necessity 
of routine polysomnographic testing may be moot. 

Regarding the 5 children who worsened after surgery, 
no predictive factors could be demonstrated, although 
the small sample size of patients in this category 
would limit the ability to find significant trends. Four of 
5 patients who worsened were seen after surgery at 22 
days, so it is possible that they were still experiencing

symptoms of recovery. We do not have longer-term data 
to know whether these patients ultimately improved. The 
fact that a small percentage of patients seems to worsen 
after surgery without explanation merits discussion with 
the parents, as does any other possible outcome discussed 
in obtaining informed consent. 

The times at which patients were seen for postoperative 
follow-up were variable (range, 21-98 days) because 
of factors beyond our control. However, mean follow-up 
was 35.7 days and median follow-up was 30 days. Note that 
75% of patients were followed for 41 days or less. Ninety 
percent of patients were followed for 55 days or less. Linear 
regression analysis found no relationship between length 
of follow-up and improved QOL. We divided the group into 
2 subgroups based on length of follow-up: (1) 30 days or 
less of follow-up and (2) more than 30 days of follow-up. 
The difference in survey change score was statistically significant, 
with a change of 1.97 (1.6) (n=50) vs 2.74 (1.24) 
(n=48) (P.01) for the 2 groups, respectively, using a standard 
t test. This 0.77 difference represents a small improvement 
in QOL change score as defined by Juniper et al.10 
This analysis reflects that QOL may continue to improve 
even beyond the early postoperative period (30 days), 
which would be a desirable outcome for these patients. This 
finding makes sense considering the usual clinical course 
of patients who demonstrate overall improved health and 
well-being within several months of adenotonsillectomy. 
We do not have longer-term follow-up data on these patients 
to be able to comment on whether this finding holds 
true for these patients. 

As seen in the previous study,6 there was poor correlation 
between clinical ratings of degree of airway obstruction 
and the mean survey score. In the present study, 
we attempted to find a better model for defining physical 
characteristics that would be predictive of improvement 
in QOL. Guilleminault et al9 showed that high scores on 
the clinical OCF scale and tonsillar scale were correlated 
with a diagnosis of UARS and obstructive sleep apnea in 
411 children presenting to a sleep center for evaluation. 
In the present study, these factors were not predictive of 
improved QOL in multivariate analysis. However, virtually 
all of our patients had a degree of tonsillar obstruction 
greater than 50%, so the data may have been too homogeneous 
to give a meaningful correlation. Regarding 
the OCF score, we found that children in all categories 
(low, medium, or high) had substantial improvements in 
QOL. This may indicate a lack of sensitivity of the scale 
or incorrect categorization of the physical characteristics 
by the many physicians participating in the study. It could 
also reflect that children with all types of OCF characteristics 
can achieve a large benefit in QOL from adenotonsillectomy. 
A larger sample size is needed to further clarify 
these findings. 

The results of the parental Satisfaction With Decision 
and Satisfaction With Office Visit scales were also 
not correlated with patient outcome. This was an important 
finding because we wanted to show that improvements 
after surgery were due to the surgery itself and were 
not biased by parents who were exceptionally satisfied 
with the perioperative care. Findings from the satisfaction 
survey were similar to those of Rosenfeld et al7 in 
parents who were having their children evaluated for tym


panostomy tube placement. Sixty-five percent of parents 
rated the overall visit as excellent, and 93% rated 
their visit as very good or excellent. The lowest area of 
satisfaction was concerning the explanation by the physician 
of what was done for the child. This was rated as 
excellent by only 69% of parents, although it was rated 
as very good and good by an additional 27% and 4% of 
parents, respectively. This finding reiterates the need to 
make sure parents have a true understanding of visit proceedings. 
Findings on the Satisfaction With Decision Scale 
were also independent of outcome. Results showed that 
only about two thirds of parents felt strongly that they 
were told enough to make a good decision for their child, 
felt it was the best decision for their child, expected to 
follow through with the decision, and were content overall 
with the decision to have surgery. These findings may 
indicate the apprehension that parents feel when electing 
to have a surgical procedure performed on their child, 
but they may also reinforce the need for adequate physician 
education so that parents can be as comfortable 
as possible with their decision. 

Strengths of this study include the high generalizability 
of the findings given the geographically diverse regions 
in which the study was performed, which included 
urban and suburban populations. The findings of this study 
are also easily generalizable to clinical practice because patients 
included in this study likely represent children all 
along the spectrum of sleep-disordered breathing. No effort 
was made to limit study participants to those with documented 
polysomnographic abnormalities. As discussed previously, 
this could have led to the exclusion of children with 
significant sleep fragmentation. 

Another limitation is the short time after surgery at 
which follow-up questionnaires were obtained. Most postoperative 
visits were scheduled beyond the point (4-5 
weeks) at which many clinicians typically see their patients 
(2-3 weeks) to avoid sampling symptoms of recovery. 
We found that compliance with the postoperative 
visit is often poor, and we believed that extension of 
the time any later after surgery would decrease patient 
return rates even further. Therefore, our results can only 
give insight into short-term QOL improvements. There 
is no reason to believe that the OSD would recur in most 
children, although there is a small possibility of symptomatic 
adenoid regrowth.22 In addition, there is the possibility 
that the onset of puberty in boys can lead to upper 
airway anatomic changes that can cause recurrence 
of sleep-disordered breathing.1,23,24 Further research is 
needed to comment on the long-term effects of adenotonsillectomy 
on child QOL. However, as more time 
elapses after surgery for patient evaluation, the more difficult 
it will be to dissect out improvement in QOL due 
to the surgical procedure from other medical, social, and 
developmental factors. 

In conclusion, most children with OSDs who are selected 
for surgery in pediatric otolaryngology practices 
will have a large improvement in QOL, at least in the short 
term, after adenotonsillectomy.
