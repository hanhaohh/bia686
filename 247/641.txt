bstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), characterized by snoring, repetitive apneic episodes, hypoxemia, sleep disruption, 
daytime sleepiness, and neurobehavioral dysfunction, is a treatable condition affecting 2% of school-aged children.1,2 
Because of its association with obesity, the prevalence of OSA is expected to rise as obesity rates increase.3,4 Besides 
obesity, OSA and OSA symptoms in childhood have been associated with other risk factors, including adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy,1 premature birth,2 and African-American2,5 or Hispanic6 ethnicity. The 
basis for these reported ethnic differences in OSA is unclear, but it has not been explained 
by obesity or respiratory problems such as asthma.5 Racial differences in biological 
characteristics such as craniofacial and upper airway structure possibly linked to OSA have 
been suggested,7,8 and ethnic differences in mode of inheritance of OSA have been See

of severe socioeconomic disadvantage with OSA; and (2) to 
assess confounding between residence in a neighborhood of 
severe socioeconomic disadvantage and recognized risk factors 
for OSA, including prematurity and African-American ethnicity. 
Secondary analyses further assessed the relationship 
between residence in a highly disadvantaged neighborhood 
and OSA, controlling for indicators of household-level SES 
or health characteristics. 

METHODS 


Sample 


The current study analyzes cross-sectional data collected 
as part of the Cleveland Children’s Sleep and Health 
Study (CCSHS), an ongoing investigation of the epidemiology 
of sleep-disordered breathing and health in an urban, 
ethnically diverse community-based cohort of children 8 to 11 
years of age.2,16,17 Details of the study cohort’s construction 
have been described elsewhere.2,16 Briefly, the cohort consists 
of a stratified, random sample of 907 term and preterm 
children born between 1988 and 1993 at three major Cleveland 
area hospitals. The study was designed to overrepresent 
African-American and former preterm children to increase 
internal validity and have stable estimates of the relationship 
between OSA and health outcomes for these subgroups. 

Measurements 
and 
Protocol 


The CCSHS’s extensive protocol included home visits 
to participating families, in-home overnight cardiorespiratory 
studies, physical exams, and assessments of behavior/functional 
outcomes, neuropsychological development, and the 
family/home environment. Demographic characteristics and 
children’s chronic health/behavioral conditions, including 
sleep symptoms and disorders, were obtained from the caregiver-
completed Children’s Health Questionnaire-PF5018 
and Children’s Sleep and Health Questionnaire.19 The in-
home overnight studies included cardiorespiratory recordings 
of thoracic and abdominal excursions, tidal volume, pulse 
oximetry, heart rate, and body position (PT-2, SensorMedics, 
Yorba Linda, Calif). Technically satisfactory home studies 
were obtained for 94% of the sample. The study was approved 
by the Institutional Review Boards of participating 
institutions. Written informed consent was obtained from 
guardians, and assent was obtained from children. Participants 
were enrolled between September 1998 and October 
2001. CCSHS data pertaining to OSA prevalence, sleep 
patterns, asthma, and behavioral outcomes have been previously 
reported.2,16,17,19-21 

Outcome 


OSA was defined as: (1) an obstructive apnea hypopnea 
index of at least 5 events per hour of estimated sleep time; or 

(2) an obstructive apnea index of at least 1 event per hour. 
These definitions represent respiratory disturbance indices 
commonly applied in clinical practice.2 Hypopneas were 
scored when respiratory efforts were accompanied by a 25% to 
50% reduction in estimated tidal volume and accompanied by 
at least 3% oxyhemoglobin desaturation, or when clearly discernable 
decreases in estimated tidal volume were associated 
with similar desaturations. 

Covariates 


Covariates shown to be associated with OSA in our 
previous analyses2,5 were included in adjusted regression analyses: 
participants’ preterm 
status 
(born at 37 weeks’ gestational 
age) and African-American 
ethnicity 
(parent report, using 
a 5-category response option). Child health covariates 
included: obesity, defined as body mass index (BMI) 95th 
percentile for age per established guidelines22; asthma, 
identified 
by caregiver report of doctor-diagnosed asthma; and 
enlarged 
tonsils, 
defined as 50% posterior pharyngeal obstruction 
identified during a physical exam. Primary caregiver 
characteristics consisted of two household-level measures of 
SES: caregiver’s 
education, 
categorized as did not complete 
high school, completed high school diploma/GED, or obtained 
more than high-school education; and caregiver’s 
marital 
status, 
dichotomized as married or not married (single, 
separated, divorced, widowed, or never married). Additional 
household characteristics included maternal 
smoking, defined 
as whether the child’s mother smoked at least one cigarette 
per day the previous year; and household 
smoker, defined as at 
least one smoker resident in the child’s home. 

Neighborhood 
SES 


The primary predictor in our analyses was an index of 
neighborhood SES. Information about participants’ neighborhood 
environments was ascertained by matching each 
child’s current address to the corresponding 2000 US Bureau 
of the Census tract. Census tracts have been used as a 
proxy for neighborhood or community environments in 
studies involving a range of health outcomes,23,24 and 
tract-level data from the US Census cover a wide range of 
characteristics, including poverty, family structure, employment, 
and education. Residence in a neighborhood of 
very low SES was based on published criteria15 utilizing 
four measures of neighborhood characteristics to capture 
the “compounding effect” of these conditions: poverty rate, 
proportion of families with related children headed by 
single females, high-school dropout rate, and proportion of 
civilian, non-institutionalized, working age (16-64 years) 
males unemployed or not in the labor force. Using this 
approach, severely disadvantaged (termed “distressed”) 
neighborhoods are defined as those census tracts with 
values at least 1 standard deviation above the mean for US 
Census tracts on at least 3 of the 4 measures.15 Using data 
for all 65,443 US Census tracts from the 2000 Census,25 
we created a binary variable indicating residence in a severely 
disadvantaged neighborhood by categorizing neighborhoods 
as severely disadvantaged if the census tract met 
at least three of the four criteria: (1) 25.1% persons in 
poverty; (2) 34.3% households headed by a single female

Analyses 


Groups were compared using two sample t 
tests, the 
Wilcoxon’s rank sum test, and 2 tests for normally distributed, 
skewed, and categorical data, respectively. Logistic regression 
was used to assess the unadjusted relationship between 
neighborhood distress and the probability of OSA as 
well as the adjusted relationship, controlling for recognized 
risk factors (ethnicity, prematurity, obesity). Parameter coefficients 
for the recognized risk factors were compared in 
models with and without inclusion of the distressed neighborhood 
indicator to assess the extent to which the former 
factors were confounded by this measure of SES. Given the 
evidence that the genetic underpinnings and inherited risk 
factors for OSA may differ among ethnic groups, and because 
the effects of ethnicity and SES may be difficult to discern, 
analyses also were repeated after stratifying by ethnicity. Exact 
logistic regression was used to estimate the associations with 
OSA due to the smaller sample and event size for these 
subgroups. Further secondary analyses were performed additionally 
controlling for either a measure of household-level 
SES or a health-related covariate. Associations between predictors 
and OSA are expressed as odds ratios with 95% CIs. 
Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the 
Social Sciences version 12.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill), Statistical 
Analytical Systems version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., 

Cary, NC), and LogXact version 2.1 (Cytel Software Corp., 
Cambridge, Mass).

The analytic sample consisted of 843 of the 907 cohort 
members (92.9%) whose addresses could be linked to a census 
tract and for whom OSA status was determined. Of the 64 
(7.1%) children excluded from analyses, 7 had addresses that 
could not be matched to a census tract, and 57 had an 
inadequate sleep study because of technical problems with 
data acquisition (ie, OSA status not determinable). Comparisons 
of the 843 children in the analytic sample with the 
excluded 64 children revealed no significant differences in any 
of the study variables. 

Forty (4.7%) children had OSA (Table I). Mean age of 
the sample was 9.5 . 
0.8 years, with nearly equal proportions 
of girls and boys. By design, about one third of children were 
African-American, and nearly 50% were born prematurely. 
The 843 children were residents of 442 unique census tracts. 
The mean and median number of children studied per census 
tract was 1.9 and 1.0, respectively, with a maximum of 8 
children from one tract. The 40 children with OSA lived in 
34 census tracts; no more than 2 OSA children were from the 
same tract.

age, gender, BMI percentile, obesity, and asthma (Table I). 
As reported previously,2 a significantly greater proportion 
of children with OSA were of preterm birth and were 
African-American. The OSA group also was more likely 
than the non-OSA group to have had enlarged tonsils, an 
unmarried and less educated primary caregiver, a mother 
who currently smoked, and at least one smoker in the 
household. 

Concerning neighborhood characteristics, one fifth 
(21.1%) of children lived in neighborhoods that were classified 
as severely socioeconomically disadvantaged. Comparison 
between children with and without OSA revealed that a 
greater proportion of children with OSA lived in severely 
disadvantaged neighborhoods (55.0% vs 19.4%, P 
. 
.001). 
Moreover, compared with children without OSA, children 
with OSA were significantly more likely to live in a census 
tract with: high poverty rate (62.5% vs 20.4%, P 
. 
.001), high 
proportion of female-headed families with related children 
(72.5% vs 36.1%, P 
. 
.001), and high percentage of civilian, 
non-institutionalized working-age males unemployed or not 
in labor force (55.0% vs 21.4%, P 
. 
.001). The proportion of 
children with OSA versus without OSA living in neighborhoods 
characterized by a high high-school dropout rate did 
not differ (12.5% vs 13.0%, P 
. 
.93).

Comparison of child and caregiver/household characteristics 
stratified by residence or nonresidence in a severely 
disadvantaged neighborhood revealed no significant 
differences in children’s age and proportions of children 
who were male, preterm, obese, or asthmatic. However, 
compared with children living in nonseverely disadvantaged 
neighborhoods, children living in severely disadvantaged 
neighborhoods were more likely to be African-
American (88.2% vs 22.6%, P 
. 
.001); have a greater 
median BMI percentile (69.3% vs 61.1%, P

Multivariable

Regression 
Analyses 
Predicting 
OSA 


Unadjusted analyses showed that children living in a 
distressed neighborhood had five times the odds of OSA 
compared with children not living in a distressed neighborhood 
(Table II). This association remained statistically significant 
after adjustment for prematurity, African-American 
ethnicity, and obesity. Severely disadvantaged neighborhood 
did not appreciably confound the association between prematurity 
and OSA (point estimate increased by 2.5%) or obesity 
and OSA (point estimate increased 11.5%). However, the 
point estimate for African-American ethnicity decreased by 
nearly 50%. Secondary analyses stratified by ethnicity showed 
that severe neighborhood disadvantage remained a significant 
predictor of OSA after controlling for prematurity and obesity 
among African-Americans (OR . 
3.80, 95% CI, 1.4211.95). 
Among non–African-Americans, analyses were limited 
by the small number of children with OSA (n . 
13), 
resulting in an elevated point estimate, but wide confidence 
intervall (OR . 
2.67, 95% CI 0.06-22.02). 

Additional secondary analyses assessed the relationship 
between severely disadvantaged neighborhoods and OSA, 
controlling for preterm status, African-American ethnicity, 
and obesity, as well as for either a child-health variable 
(asthma, large tonsil size), child-demographic factor (age, 
sex), family-level SES indicator (marital status or caregiver 
education), or other household characteristic (maternal smoking, 
household smoker). Adjusted results showed that children 
living in a neighborhood of severe socioeconomic disadvantage 
and preterm children remained at significantly 
increased odds of OSA in all analyses. Of the health, child-
demographic, and family/household-level variables, only large 
tonsil size was significantly associated with OSA (OR . 
2.16, 
95% CI 1.11-4.21, P 
. 
.02, controlling for preterm status, 
African-American ethnicity, obesity, and severe neighborhood 
disadvantage). Inclusion of tonsillar size did not alter 
the relationship between severe neighborhood disadvantage 
and OSA.

OSA, this study investigated the relationship between OSA 
and indices of neighborhood SES. Results indicated that 
living in a highly socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhood 
was a risk factor for OSA, and this relationship persisted 
even after adjusting for African-American ethnicity, preterm 
birth, obesity, as well as other child-health characteristics and 
measures of family SES, such as caregiver education and 
marital status. Furthermore, in stratified analyses, among the 
African-American subgroup, residence in a highly disadvantaged 
neighborhood presented additional risk for OSA beyond 
that attributed to other health (eg, obesity, prematurity) 
factors. Although severe neighborhood disadvantage was not 
significantly associated with OSA among non–African-
Americans, the small number of OSA cases in this subgroup 
may have limited our power to detect a difference. The 
finding that a measure of neighborhood-level SES had a 
significant effect after controlling for caregiver education or 
marital status suggested that something about neighborhood 
conditions, above and beyond family/individual risk factors 
associated with SES, may have contributed to OSA. This 
“added effect” of neighborhoods or communities has been 
found for other health conditions, such as asthma,23 breast 
cancer,24 and coronary heart disease.11 

The underlying bases for the association between 
neighborhood-level conditions and OSA are presently speculative. 
Reported risk factors for pediatric OSA (African-
American ethnicity, history of prematurity, asthma, and obesity2,3,5) 
may all disproportionately occur in children of low 
SES. However, even after adjustment for these factors, neighborhood 
distress remained significantly associated with OSA. 
Low SES may additionally result in exposures to a number of 
environmental and social stressors adversely affecting 
health.26 For example, housing conditions in poverty-stricken 
neighborhoods generally produce greater exposure to cockroach 
allergen, a factor associated with inner city asthma.27 
Also, exposure to irritants, such as environmental tobacco 
smoke, is often greater in neighborhoods with low SES,12,28 
with greater exposure possibly occurring both at home as well 
as in schools and other settings in low-SES neighborhoods.26 
Passive smoking is a well-known risk factor for habitual 
snoring, a cardinal symptom of OSA in children.29 Chronic 
exposures to allergens and/or irritants may augment upper 
airway inflammation, increasing nasal resistance, and perhaps 
triggering lymphoid hypertrophy and pharyngeal obstruction.
30,31 Additionally, children from low SES neighborhoods 
may experience greater exposure to toxins such as lead26 and 
environmental contaminants from toxic waste sites and active 
or former industrial sites.32 Although speculative, early life 
exposures to environmental neurotoxins may adversely influence 
neuromuscular function of the upper airway. Residents 
of low SES neighborhoods also experience greater exposure to 
environmental noise and community violence, which may also 
increase stress.33,34 Stress, noise, or both, may decrease sleep 
duration or quality. Sleep deprivation or fragmentation may 
increase the propensity for OSA.35 

Although prematurity is increased in African Ameri


cans and in low SES neighborhoods,36,37 preterm status remained 
a significant risk factor for OSA after accounting for 
the effects of household SES factors and other covariates, 
providing additional evidence of its relationship to OSA in 
pre-adolescent children and the need for anticipatory screening 
for OSA in preterm children.2 In contrast to prematurity, 
attenuation of the association of African-American ethnicity 
with OSA after considering residence in a neighborhood of 
severe socio-economic disadvantage suggested that a portion 
of the observed elevated risk of OSA for African-American 
children was related to components of the socio-economic 
conditions in which they live. However, residence in a severely 
disadvantaged neighborhood and African American 
ethnicity were highly associated. While not statistically significant, 
the adjusted point estimate for African American 
ethnicity suggested that African American children have a 
2-fold increased odds of OSA, consistent with prior work 
indicating that underlying biological, and perhaps genetic 
factors, also may contribute to risk of OSA.9 

Study limitations should be noted. First, our secondary 
stratified analysis had limited power to detect a significant 
association between severely disadvantaged neighborhoods 
and OSA among non–African-Americans because only 22% 
of non–African-Americans in this sample live in such neighborhoods, 
and only 13 non–African-American children had 
OSA. Second, results may have been confounded by other 
unmeasured variables related to SES on a neighborhood or 
family level and to OSA. Third, measures of household SES 
were limited to caregiver’s education and marital status; 
household income was unavailable. Fourth, the number of 
children with OSA restricted the number of predictors that 
could be modeled simultaneously. Fifth, because the duration 
of residence in a specific tract is unknown, the extent to which 
residence in a distressed neighborhood operated as a cumulative 
versus acute exposure cannot be determined. Finally, 
because these results are based on one Midwest urban area, it 
is unclear as to the extent to which the results would apply to 
other geographic areas, differing in factors such as climate, 
degree of urbanization, and pollution levels. 

Children living in highly disadvantaged neighborhoods 
experience multiple, cumulative stressors or risk factors for 
adverse health outcomes.12,38 In summary, our study found 
that residence in a neighborhood of severe socioeconomic 
disadvantage is also associated with childhood OSA, a condition 
associated with behavioral, cognitive, and academic 
problems.21,39 This study underscores the critical need to 
further assess the role of neighborhood conditions as a factor 
that influences children’s sleep because the nature of interventions 
to improve sleep may differ greatly depending on the 
actual etiological mechanism(s) involved. In the case of OSA, 
future research should investigate the role of specific characteristics 
of severely disadvantaged neighborhoods (eg, allergens, 
irritants, neighborhood-induced stress) in OSA’s etiology. 
Perhaps improving neighborhood conditions for the 
numerous children living in such locations will lead, among 
many positive outcomes, to improved sleep.
