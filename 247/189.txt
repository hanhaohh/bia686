ABSTRACT: This study was conducted to determine the influence of puberty on 
features of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in adolescents. 

The study was performed in a general population sample of 226 adolescents of both 
sexes (aged 11–19 yrs) recruited from the secondary school population of the city of 
Seville, Spain. Subjects were divided into two groups: 1) postpubertal, i.e. females who 
had undergone menarche and males in whom axillary hair development or peak height 
velocity had occurred w1 yr before the study; and 2) peripubertal, i.e. females who had 
not undergone menarche and males who had not developed axillary hair nor reached 
peak height velocity, or subjects in whom these pubertal changes had appeared v1yr 
before the study. All subjects answered a questionnaire on SDB and underwent 
overnight cardiorespiratory polygraphy. 

There were 50 males and 40 females (mean¡SD age 13.5¡1.2 yrs) in the peripubertal 
group, and 54 males and 82 females (age 16.3¡1.7 yrs) in the postpubertal group. 
Males exhibited significantly higher neck circumference/height index and waist/hip 
index than females in both the peripubertal and postpubertal groups. In the postpubertal 
group, snoring and polygraphic alterations (respiratory events and oximetric 
parameters) were significantly more frequent in males than in females. Postpubertal 
adolescents showed sex differences in clinical and polygraphic parameters that were not 
observed at earlier pubertal stages. 

These findings support the influence of sex hormones on sex differences in sleep-
disordered breathing.

This study was supported by grants 38/96 and

RESPIRA Research Network (RTIC 03/11), 
Health Institute "Carlos III", Madrid, Spain. 

Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) includes a broad range of 
symptoms, from slight snoring to severe cases of obstructive 
sleep apnoea syndrome. Population-based studies have linked 
even mild SDB among adults with a higher number of traffic 
accidents, cardiovascular disease and other adverse health 
outcomes [1–3]. SDB has been assumed to be a condition 
associated primarily with males. In clinical samples, the ratio 
of males to females for prevalence of SDB has been 
considered to be y10:1 [4, 5]. In general population samples, 
it has been shown that sleep apnoea occurs more frequently 
than assumed in females. Most estimates of the male/female 
ratio in the general public are in the region of 2:1 or 3:1 [6–8]. 
The reason for this sexual disparity is not fully understood; 
however, it has been suggested that the risk factors and 
mechanisms for the development of SDB, particularly in both 
the structure and function of the upper airway, may differ 
between males and females [9–13]. Sex hormones have also 
been thought to influence the development of obstructive 
sleep apnoea. It has been shown that menopause is a risk 
factor for SDB and that hormone replacement therapy 
modifies this risk [14]. Conversely, treatment with testosterone 
has been reported to cause obstructive sleep apnoea in 
males [15]. In addition, a case of a nonobese female with 
clinically significant obstructive sleep apnoea and a benign 
testosterone-producing ovarian tumour that resolved after 
successful removal of the tumour, along with normalisation of 
testosterone levels, has been reported [16]. 

SDB in childhood has clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic 
characteristics that are different from those found in adults 
[17]; however, sex differences in the prevalence of SDB in 
the paediatric age group have not been observed [18, 19]. 
Alterations in upper airway morphology at puberty may play 
a significant role in the development of SDB in early 
adulthood [20]. In the adolescent population, however, there 
is little information regarding the prevalence and clinical 
expression of SDB [21]. The present study was, therefore, 
performed to determine the influence of puberty on clinical, 
anthropometric and polygraphic features related to SDB in a 
general population sample of adolescents recruited from the 
secondary school population of the city of Seville, Spain. 

Methods 

A cross-sectional study was carried out in a general 
population sample of 226 adolescents of both sexes aged 
11–19 yrs. In order to obtain a representative sample of the 
general population of adolescents, a full official directory of 
the 220 public and private secondary schools in the city of 
Seville, Spain, was obtained. A total of 32 schools were 
chosen randomly using a table of aleatory numbers. In each 
school, all the subjects from the same classroom were 
contacted. No inclusion or exclusion criteria based on the 
absence or presence of previous or underlying diseases were

established. The study was approved by the science and 
education department of the autonomous government of 
Andalusia. Written informed consent was obtained from 
adolescents who voluntarily agreed to take part and from 
their parents or legal guardians. The study included the 
administration of a questionnaire for the investigation of 
SDB symptoms, measurement of anthropometric parameters 
and overnight home polygraphy. 

The questionnaire consisted of 82 items (grouped into 
demographics, salient features of family and personal history, 
school performance, and nocturnal and daytime symptoms 
suggestive of SDB), the details of which have been previously 
described [21]. Symptoms were assessed according to a frequency 
scale that included the following answers: "unknown", 
"never", "rarely" 
(f1 event?week-1), "sometimes" 
(2 events? 
week-1), and "often" 
(o3 events?week-1). Snorers answered 
"sometimes" 
or "often" 
for the question on snoring. Habitual 
snoring was defined as snoring on w3 days?week-1. Other 
symptoms, such as reported sleep apnoeas (stoppage of 
breathing during sleep observed by parents) were assessed 
using the same frequency scale and excessive daytime 
sleepiness according to a three-degree scale: slight, moderate 
and severe. Anthropometric measurements included weight, 
height, and neck, waist and hip circumference, as previously 
described [21]. The body mass index (BMI), defined as the 
weight in kilograms divided by height squared in metres, and 
the neck circumference-to-height and waist-to-hip perimeter 

-2

ratios were calculated. Subjects with a BMI of o28 kg?m 
were considered obese. 

Subjects were divided into two groups: 1) postpubertal, i.e. 
females who had undergone menarche and males in whom 
axillary hair development or peak height velocity had 
occurred w1 yr before the study; and 2) peripubertal, i.e. 
females who had not undergone menarche and males who had 
not developed axillary hair nor reached peak height velocity, 
or subjects in whom these pubertal changes had appeared 
v1 yr before the study. 

In all subjects, overnight home polygraphy was performed 
using a portable ambulatory device (Apnoescreen II; Erich 
Jaeger Gmbh & CoKg, Wu¨rzburg, Germany), with continuous 
monitoring of oronasal airflow (thermistor), chest and 
abdominal respiratory movements (thoracic and abdominal 
belts), arterial oxygen saturation (Sa,O2; digital pulse oximetry), 
cardiac frequency (digital probe), electrocardiography, 
body position (mercury sensor) and actigraphy (wristband 
with activity sensor). Analysis was carried out manually. The 
following parameters were assessed: respiratory events, defined 
as a decrease in oronasal airflow below a fixed threshold 
(established as a flow whose intensity corresponds to 35 bytes 
on the computer graphic scale) for o5 s; oxygen desaturation, 
defined as a drop in Sa,O2 of o4% for o8 s; and cardiac 
events, defined as a change in cardiac frequency of o10 beats? 
min-1 for o10 s. Cardiac events were considered to be related 
to respiratory events and/or desaturations if they occurred 
simultaneously. Variables analysed were total recording (sleep) 
time (TRT), TRT in the supine position (TRTsup), respiratory 
disturbance index (RDI; respiratory events per hour), RDI 
during TRTsup (RDIsup), oxygen desaturation index (ODI) 
(number of oxygen desaturations per hour), and total number 
of cardiac events concurrent with respiratory events and/or 
oxygen desaturation. 

Statistical analysis 

All results are expressed as mean¡SD. The unpaired two-
tailed t-test was used for comparison of quantitative variables 
and the Chi-squared test (with Fisher9s exact test when 

necessary) for comparison of categorical variables between 
peripubertal and postpubertal adolescents. Analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) was used to compare RDI (independent 
variable) between males and females in the postpubertal 
group after adjusting for age, BMI and waist/hip index. 
Significance was set at pv0.05. 

Results 

The target population was made up of 933 subjects, of 
whom 394 (42.2%) refused to participate in the study. Of the 
remaining 539, 313 (33.5%) refused to undergo overnight 
polygraphy but completed a few items of the questionnaire. 
Thus the study population comprised 226 (24.2%) subjects. 
There were no differences between the 313 unincluded subjects 
and the 226 adolescents included in male/female ratio 
(149/164 versus 104/122), age (14.5¡2.2 versus 14.9¡2.0 yrs), 
or frequency of snoring (18.4 versus 26.5%), witnessed apnoeas 

(4.1 versus 3.1%) or sleepiness (33.8 versus 30.1%). 
Of the 226 included adolescents, aged 14.9¡2.0 yrs, 104 
were male and 122 were female; 19¡8.4% were obese. At 
menarche and at onset of development of secondary sexual 
characteristics, females and males were aged 11.8¡1.1 and 
13¡1.3 yrs, respectively. Sixty subjects were classified as 
snorers and 35 as habitual snorers. The frequency distribution 
of anthropometric, clinical and polygraphic variables in the 
study population is shown in table 1. 

Sex differences in the peripubertal group 

The peripubertal group included 90 subjects, 55.5% male 
and 43.4% female, aged 13.5¡1.2 and 13.1¡0.8 yrs, respectively. 
Menarche or development of secondary sexual 
characteristics had not occurred in 30 of the adolescents, 
whereas, in the remaining 60, these changes had occurred 
within the year prior to the study. There were no differences 
between males and females in anthropometric, clinical and 
polygraphic variables, except for significantly higher neck

circumference/height index and waist/hip index in males compared 
to females, and excessive daytime sleepiness in females 
compared to males (table 2). The frequency of excessive 
daytime sleepiness was significantly higher in the postpubertal 
group than in the peripubertal group (37 versus 20%, p=0.04). 

Sex differences in the postpubertal group 

The postpubertal group included 136 subjects, 39.7% male 
and 60.3% female, aged 16.3¡1.7 and 15.6¡1.9 yrs, respectively. 
The study was carried out 3.3¡1.1 yrs after axillary 
hair development and peak height velocity in males, and 
4.1¡1.9 yrs after menarche in females (range 2–8 yrs). With 
regard to anthropometric variables, males compared to females 
exhibited significantly higher neck circumference/height index 
and waist/hip index (table 2). Conversely, the frequency of 
snoring was significantly higher in males, whereas headache 
was significantly higher in females. Results of cardiorespiratory 
polygraphy showed significant differences in favour of 
males, i.e. higher RDI, RDIsup, ODI and number of cardiac 
events and lower baseline Sa,O2 and Sa,O2 nadir (table 2). On 
ANCOVA, differences between males and females in RDI 
remained after controlling for age (p=0.019) and BMI 
(p=0.045). However, after adjusting for waist/hip index, sex 
differences in RDI were not observed. 

Discussion 

The present results indicate that, in adolescents at advanced 
stages of sexual maturation, there are differences between 
males and females in the frequency of some symptoms related 
to SDB, such as snoring, as well as in the frequency and 
severity of cardiorespiratory polygraphy alterations. These 
features were not found among adolescents who were in an 
early phase of puberty. 

It is well known that the clinical and polysomnographic 

characteristics of SDB are different in the various stages 
of life. In childhood, the mean prevalence of SDB is y2%, 
without sex differences. In adulthood, population-based studies 
showed a prevalence of SDB that was higher in males than in 
females, particularly in the 30–60-yr stratum [22]. Some 
authors have recently shown an increase in the prevalence of 
SDB in females after the menopause. Since the mid-1980s, 
there has been progressive interest shown in the scientific 
literature regarding the effect of sex hormones on SDB, 
although results of early studies based on small study series 
were unclear [23, 24]. Recently, BIXLER et al. [14] provided 
epidemiological evidence for a lower prevalence of SDB in 
postmenopausal females using hormone replecement therapy 
than in nonusers. Studies in the elderly population revealed a 
high frequency of SDB, and it has been shown that sex 
differences in the prevalence of SDB decrease as age increases 
[6]. These findings support a protective effect of female sex 
hormones on some of the pathogenetic factors related to 
SDB. Conversely, increased testosterone levels have been 
associated with exacerbation or occurrence of obstructive 
sleep apnoea in a few adult male and female cases [15, 16]. It 
has been speculated that testosterone may influence neuromuscular 
control of the upper airway and the central pattern 
of body fat distribution that have been related to SDB in 
adulthood. 

In contrast to the evidence of the effect of age and sex on 
SDB in adult population groups, in the adolescent population, 
as far as the present authors are aware, the influence of 
sex hormones on sex differences in SDB has not been 
examined previously. With regard to methodological aspects, 
the strengths of the study include the participation of a 
general population sample of 226 adolescents aged 11–19 yrs 
and performance of overnight polygraphy in all subjects. For 
logistical purposes and to avoid refusals related to blood 
sample testing, arbitrary clinical criteria were used to classify 
subjects into the peripubertal and postpubertal groups 
[25-28], rather than serum hormone levels. This is a limitation 
of the study and should be taken into account in interpreting

the results. Another methodological aspect that should be 
emphasised is that, rather than employing nasal prongs or an 
intraoesophageal catheter to monitor airflow, a thermistor 
was used. This does not invalidate the differences that were 
found in respiratory events between the two groups, although 
it is possible that some respiratory events associated with flow 
limitation might not have been detected. 

Of the adolescents,y15% were considered habitual snorers. 
This figure is similar to that reported by others for paediatric 
groups and student populations [18, 19, 29, 30]. Sex differences 
in the peripubertal group were not observed, but the 
frequency of habitual snorers was significantly higher among 
males than among females in the postpubertal group. These 
results may indicate that well-established clinical differences 
in adult subjects become evident at puberty. The frequency of 
daytime hypersomnolence was significantly higher in females 
than in males in the peripubertal group, whereas sex differences 
in excessive daytime sleepiness in the postpubertal 
group were not found. However, it is known that the cause of 
daytime hypersomnolence in adolescents is multifactorial [31, 
32]. Adolescence delays the "sleep-on" 
setting in the biological 
clock with a trend towards going to bed and waking up late, 
which cannot be accomplished within the scholarly timetable, 
and results in a cumulative sleep debt, leading to adolescent 
daytime sleepiness. 

Data regarding respiratory pattern in general population 
samples of adolescents are lacking, and, in most series, broader 
age ranges are included, subjects are selected according to 
certain characteristics, such as obesity, or polygraphy is only 
carried out on a subset of the participants [33, 34]. Sex 
differences in the peripubertal group regarding polygraphic 
alterations were not observed. However, a higher number of 
respiratory events on polygraphy were observed in postpubertal 
males than females. The same trend was observed for 
oximetric parameters. Sex differences in polygraphic alterations 
in the postpubertal group were not due to age or BMI, 
but differences disappeared after adjusting for waist/hip 
index, which indicates that body fat distribution, assessed 
by the waist-to-hip ratio, may have had an effect on the 
results obtained. However, it seems likely that, in adolescents 
in advanced stages of pubertal development, other anatomical 
factors, such as craniofacial alterations or nasal obstruction, 
which could be present from childhood, or functional ones, 
may account for the lower pharyngeal collapsibility among 
females. 

In summary, postpubertal adolescents showed sex differences 
in clinical and polygraphic parameters related to sleep-
disordered breathing that were not observed at earlier 
pubertal stages. These findings, which need to be confirmed 
in longitudinal studies, support the influence of sex hormones 
on sex differences in sleep-disordered breathing that seem to 
become apparent at the time of sexual maturation.
