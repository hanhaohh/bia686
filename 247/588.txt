OBJECTIVES: 
To compare the prevalence of obesity in children 
with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) who undergo adenotonsillectomy 
to that in the general pediatric population. 
DESIGN: 
Cross-sectional controlled study. 
METHODS: 
A body-mass-index (BMI-for-age) percentile was 
determined for children with SDB and for matched controls from 
a general pediatric clinic. Children who were obese (85th %) 
were analyzed. Groups were compared using a t 
test or 2 analysis. 
Risk factors were estimated with logistic regression. 
RESULTS: 
The study population included 299 children, of 
whom 170 (56.9%) had SDB. Compared with controls, more 
children with SDB were obese (46% vs 33%, P 
. 
0.029) or 
underweight (8% vs 3%, P 
. 
0.110), and fewer children with SDB 
were healthy weight (46% vs 64%, P 
. 
0.002). Among African 
American children, those who were obese were more likely to have 
SDB (OR, 2.22, P 
. 
0.01). 
CONCLUSIONS: 
Children with SDB who undergo adenotonsillectomy 
are more likely to be obese than children seen in a 
general pediatric clinic. African American children who are obese 
are more likely to have SDB.

besity in children is a rising national and global concern. 
In 2004, one third of all children in the United 
States aged two through 19 years were overweight or at-risk 
for overweight1 (greater than the 85th percentile in body 
mass index [BMI]), representing a dramatic increase in the 
prevalence of obese children over the past three decades. 
Although an increase in obesity has been seen in children of 
all racial and ethnic backgrounds, significantly more African 
American children are affected.2,3 Childhood obesity is 
associated with numerous sequelae that affect the health of 
cardiovascular, pulmonary, metabolic, endocrine, psychosocial, 
and neurocognitive systems.4-6 These sequelae make 
childhood obesity a priority in national health research and 
initiatives. 

Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is closely associated 
with obesity in children. SDB includes a broad spectrum of 
sleep disturbances that range in severity from primary snoring 
to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Approximately 30% 

of children with obesity are thought to have OSA compared 
with 1% to 3% of children in the general population.7 
Previous studies have shown that children with OSA, characterized 
by periods of apneas and hypopneas, experience 
partial or complete resolution of symptoms as well as an 
improved health-related quality-of-life after surgical therapy 
with adenotonsillectomy.8-10 In obese children, these 
improvements are significant but not as dramatic as those 
seen in normal-weight children.7-9 

Despite a known correlation between SDB and obesity in 
children, there is limited awareness of how demographic, 
socioeconomic, and environmental factors influence the 
relationship between these two entities. Furthermore, as the 
prevalence of obesity in the general pediatric population 
increases, it is unknown how many children may have 
unrecognized SDB. Therefore, the goals of the present report 
were 1) to examine the prevalence of obesity in children 
who presented for adenotonsillectomy with SDB as 
compared with children in the general pediatric population, 
and 2) to evaluate demographic predictive risk factors for 
obesity and SDB and identify possible trends or weaknesses 
in referral patterns for adenotonsillectomy. 

METHODS 


Approval for this study was obtained from the Institutional 
Review Board at Virginia Commonwealth University 
School of Medicine in Richmond, Virginia. Included in the 
study were: 1) children scheduled to undergo adenotonsillectomy 
for a diagnosis of SDB between April 1, 2004 and 
October 1, 2005, and 2) children who presented to the 
primary care pediatric clinic for well-child visits on randomly 
selected dates in April 2005 (controls). Both groups 
of children were derived from the same population in a 
single urban tertiary-care facility. Children in the control 
population were assumed to represent the general population 
and were not screened for SDB. 

Children were excluded from the study if they were less 
than two or greater than 19 years of age. This age exclusion

recently obtained from the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES).1 

Each child’s chart was reviewed for the following demographic 
data: age, gender, race/ethnicity, height, and 
weight. BMI was calculated from the height and weight of 
each child. An age-and gender-adjusted BMI percentile was 
plotted with the CDC-standardized BMI-for-age growth 
charts (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, 
GA). Each BMI percentile was then assigned a weight-
status category that were as follows: 1) underweight, less 
than 5th percentile; 2) healthy weight, 5th percentile up to 
the 85th percentile; 3) at-risk for overweight, 85th to less 
than the 95th percentile; and 4) overweight, equal to or 
greater than the 95th percentile. Children in the third and 
fourth category, with a BMI-for-age greater than the 85th 
percentile, were considered “obese.” All data were stored in 
a confidential computer database, where identifiers were 
removed to protect patient privacy. 

Overall prevalence of obesity was estimated for the entire 
group of children and the two separate groups (children 
with SDB scheduled to undergo adenotonsillectomy and the 
control group of children who presented for well-child visits). 
Prevalence estimates were also obtained for two subsets 
of age (2 to 6 and 6 to 18 as divided by prevalence 
reported with data from NHANES1), gender, and ethnicity. 

The demographic variables between the two groups were 
compared with unpaired t 
tests (continuous variables) or 2 
analyses (categorical variables), with the use of continuity 
correlation for all 2 . 
2 analyses. A P 
value less than 0.05 
was considered significant. Logistic regression models were 

used to determine the odds ratio of the impact of age, 
gender, and ethnicity on the frequency of obesity in each 
population, and a likelihood ratio was then calculated to 
confirm the independent effects of these demographic variables 
between the two groups. All statistical analyses were 
performed with SPSS version 13.0 (Chicago, IL).

with SDB and controls) are compared in Table 1. The mean 
age of all children was 7.1 years (range, 2.1 to 18 years). 
The mean BMI for all children was 19.2 (range, 6.5 to 43.4). 
A total of 149 (49.8%) of the children were boys, and the 
predominant ethnic group was African American (193 children, 
64.5%). 

The prevalence of the four CDC-defined BMI-for-age 
classifications in children with SDB and of controls is 
shown in Figure 1. In the SDB group, 14 (8%) children 
were underweight, whereas, in the control group, four 
(3%) children were underweight (P 
. 
0.11). Seventy-
eight (46%) children in the SDB group were healthy 
weight, whereas 82 (64%) controls were healthy weight 
(P 
. 
0.004). The prevalence of at-risk for overweight 
and overweight combined was 46% for children with 
SDB and 33% for controls (P 
. 
0.038). The overall 
distribution of BMI-for-age categories (underweight, 
healthy weight, at-risk for overweight, overweight) differed 
significantly in children with SDB from those in the 
control group (P 
. 
0.011). Children in the SDB group 
had higher frequencies in the underweight, at-risk for 
overweight, and overweight categories. 

Table 2 shows demographic variables as they relate to 
SDB for children who were obese (85th percentile). 
Within this subset of children, the mean BMI and mean age 
did not differ significantly between the two groups. However, 
African American children in this subset were one 
third less likely to be in the SDB group (OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 

0.13 to 0.83; P 
. 
0.02). 
Results of the multivariate analyses that examined the 
frequency of obesity while adjusting for age, gender, and 
ethnicity are shown in Table 3. Likelihood ratio tests that 
control for demographic variables in all children confirmed 
that while gender and age made no significant 
difference in the prediction of prevalence of obesity, 

DISCUSSION 


This article shows an increased prevalence of obesity in 
children with SDB who present for adenotonsillectomy 
compared with a population of healthy children. An evaluation 
of demographic variables shows that children who are 
African American and have SDB are significantly more 
likely to be obese. 

Previous articles have shown a high prevalence of obesity 
in children with SDB and that obesity is an independent 
risk factor for SDB in children and adolescents.7,11-14 As the 
numerous sequelae of SDB in childhood obesity are increasingly 
understood, the role of adenotonsillectomy as treatment 
for SDB in obese children is more apparent. Although 
it has been shown that obesity in children persists after 
adenotonsillectomy, the severity of SDB often lessens or 
resolves, which may result in fewer long-term cardiopulmonary 
consequences.10 Moreover, children who are obese 
have been noted to have a reduced health-related qualityof-
life that improves after surgical therapy with adenotonsillectomy.
9,15,16 Thus far, measures of outcome that assess 
the efficacy of adenotonsillectomy for SDB in obese children 
have been limited to BMI, polysomnography changes, 
and quality-of-life instruments. Future studies may identify

changes and/or improvements in metabolic factors, neurocognition, 
behavior, and self confidence after adenotonsillectomy 
in children with obesity and SDB. 

In the current study, we demonstrate that children with 
SDB who present for adenotonsillectomy are more likely 
to be obese than children in the general pediatric population. 
Prevalence estimates from recent studies state that 
in the general pediatric population, approximately 1% to 
3% of children have SDB, and in obese children, approximately 
30% to 40% of children have SDB.7,14 On the 
basis of these estimates, we would expect that obesity in 
children with SDB would occur approximately 10 times 
more commonly than obesity in the general pediatric 
population. This expected ratio is far greater than that 
demonstrated by the children in the present report. This 
observation may have two explanations. First, this study 
included two groups of children who are not representative 
of the overall population. Rather, the group of children 
with SDB and the control population were reflective 
of the ethnic and racial composition of the tertiary inner 
city hospital in Richmond. In addition, children were 
given a clinical diagnosis of SDB, based on symptoms 
and physical examination in the absence of polysomnography. 
Therefore a wide spectrum of severity of SDB and 
OSA may have been present. A more likely explanation 
for the closer than expected ratio of obesity in children 
with SDB compared to controls is that a lack of awareness 
of the association between obesity and SDB exists 
among primary health care providers and caregivers. 
Based on the population study estimates of SDB in obesity 
in children, it is highly probable that many children 
in the control population of children had unrecognized 
SDB worthy of referral for evaluation and surgical intervention. 


There is clearly a complex role that race and ethnicity 
play in predicting obesity and SDB in children. In this 
study, African American children were less likely overall 
to be in the SDB group. This finding is possibly due to the 
increased prevalence of underweight children in the SDB 
group when compared with controls. African American 
children have indeed been shown to be more likely to 
exhibit SDB when compared with children of other ethnicities. 
Redline et al13 estimated that African American 
children were 3.5 times more likely to have SDB than 
white children, independent of the presence of obesity. 
Likewise, Stepanski et al3 measured more oxygen desaturations 
and EEG disturbances in African American children 
when compared with white or Hispanic children, 
indicating a higher propensity for SDB. In the present 
study, being African American was an independent risk 
factor for obesity, especially among those children in the 
SDB group, a finding that is reflective of other reports. 
The most recent national data by Ogden et al1 showed 
that between 1999 and 2004, African American girls 
were significantly more likely to be overweight when 
compared with white girls. The results of the present 

study, in conjunction with other reports, stress a need for 
screening and prevention of obesity in African American 
children. The need to promote awareness of the association 
between SDB and obesity, particularly in African 
American children and adolescents, among educators, 
caregivers, primary care providers, and the general public 
cannot be overemphasized. 

Many limitations were present in this study. First, 
children in the study population were diagnosed by clinical 
symptoms and physical examination and did not 
undergo polysomnography to document the presence or 
severity of OSA. Moreover, all children were diagnosed 
with SDB in the presence of adenotonsillar hypertrophy 
and were therefore selected for surgical intervention. 
There may be obese children with SDB who do not have 
adenotonsillar hypertrophy and were not included in this 
cohort, and likewise, many of the children in this cohort 
with adenotonsillar hypertrophy may not have had OSA 
if polysomnography had been used for diagnosis. In addition, 
this report discusses the prevalence of SDB and 
risk factors for SDB in children who are “at-risk for 
overweight” and “overweight,” or have a BMI-for-age 

85th percentile. The significance of this grouping is 
unknown and may be too inclusive. The highest probability 
of childhood obesity leading to adult morbid obesity 
is seen in children who are older than 13 with a 
BMI-for-age 95th percentile.6 Another limitation of 
this article is that it is a cross-sectional study and does 
not determine long-term outcomes of obesity in children 
with SDB after adenotonsillectomy compared with controls. 
There are also some limitations to this study that are due 
to the nature of the control population. First, these children 
may have had undiagnosed SDB or other health comorbidities 
and may therefore not represent a “healthy” sample of 
children for comparison. In addition, the control group had 
many more African American children than the SDB group, 
perhaps signifying different referral patterns among children 
in different ethnic or racial groups. Although the children 
with SDB were referred to the otolaryngology service 
by providers from the general pediatric clinic, it was not 
possible to identify the source of referral for every patient. 
These issues are beyond the scope of this report but should 
be addressed in future studies. 

Despite these limitations, this report shows a higher 
prevalence of obesity in children who present for adenotonsillectomy 
when compared with healthy controls. It demonstrates 
a closer than expected ratio of obese children with 
SDB to obese children in the general population, and 
thereby suggests a pattern of decreased awareness of SDB 
in children who are obese. The report also reinforces that 
being African American is an independent risk factor for 
obesity and that African American children with SDB are at 
even greater risk of obesity. These findings help to better 
define the relationship of SDB to obesity in children and to

obesity and SDB. 

CONCLUSIONS 


The prevalence of obesity in children with SDB who present 
for adenotonsillectomy is higher than that seen in a population 
of healthy children. However, the difference in prevalence 
of obesity between the two groups of children is far 
less than would be expected. Children who are African 
American are significantly more likely to be obese, especially 
among those who have SDB. These findings may be 
indicative of a decreased awareness of the relationship between 
SDB and obesity in children, particularly in children 
who are African American.
