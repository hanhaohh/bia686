Background: 
The 
Tucson 
Children’s 
Assessment 
of 
Sleep 
Apnea 
study 
(TuCASA) 
was 
designed 
to 
investigate 
the 
prevalence 
and 
correlates 
of 
objectively 
measured 
sleep-
related 
breathing 
disorder 
(SBD) 
in 
preadolescent 
Hispanic 
and 
white 
children. 


Objective: 
To 
describe 
the 
associations 
of 
SBD 
and 
elevation 
in 
resting 
blood 
pressure 
in 
the 
first 
239 
children 
enrolled 
in 
TuCASA. 


Design: 
Children 
between 
the 
ages 
of 
6 
and 
11 
years 
(45% 
girls 
and 
51% 
Hispanic) 
from 
elementary 
schools 
of 
the 
Tucson 
Unified 
School 
District 
were 
enrolled 
in 
this 
prospective 
cohort 
study. 
Resting 
systolic 
and 
diastolic 
blood 
pressure, 
sleep 
symptoms, 
and 
parental 
smoking 
status 
were 
obtained 
during 
evening 
home 
visits, 
followed 
by 
overnight 
unattended 
home 
polysomnography. 


Results: 
The 
mean 
(SD) 
systolic 
and 
diastolic 
blood 
pressures 
were 
98.4 
(10.6) 
mm 
Hg 
and 
62.0 
(8.9) 
mm 
Hg, 
respectively. 
Fifteen 
children 
had 
hypertension. 
The 
mean 
(SD) 
respiratory 
disturbance 
index 
(2%), 
defined 
as 
the 
number 
of 
apneas 
and 
hypopneas 
per 
hour 
of 
sleep 
associated 
with 
a 
2% 
oxygen 
desaturation, 
was 
2.3 
(3.8) 
events 
per 
hour. 
Factors 
independently 
associated 
with 
systolic 
and 
diastolic 
blood 
pressure 
elevation 
were 
obesity, 
sleep 
efficiency, 
and 
respiratory 
disturbance 
index 
(2%). 


Conclusions: 
In 
preadolescent 
children, 
elevated 
blood 
pressure 
is 
associated 
with 
SBD 
and 
obesity, 
as 
previously 
noted 
in 
adults. 
The 
control 
of 
obesity 
in 
childhood 
may 
be 
important 
to 
reduce 
the 
daytime 
consequences 
of 
SBD 
and 
to 
reduce 
the 
risks 
of 
life-long 
hypertension.

HE 
ASSOCIATION 
between 
sleep-related 
breathing 
disorder 
(SBD) 
and 
hypertension 
has 
been 
recognized 
in 
adults 
since 
the 
mid 
1980s.1 
The 
cross-sectional 
associations 
of 
systolic 
and 
diastolic 
blood 
pressure 
(BP) 
(and 
hypertension) 
with 
multiple 
indices 
of 
SBD 
were 
recently 
confirmed 
in 
a 
large 
community-
based 
study2 
of 
more 
than 
6000 
adults 
(the 
Sleep 
Heart 
Health 
Study). 
Furthermore, 
higher 
mean 
diastolic 
BP 
during 
sleep 
was 
noted 
in 
a 
study 
of 
41 
children 
with 
clinically 
significant 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
syndrome 
when 
compared 
with 
children 
with 
primary 
snoring.3 
Although 
factors 
that 
influence 
BP 
in 
children 
have 
been 
studied 
in 
large 
cohorts,4-7 
to 
our 
knowledge, 
there 
are 
no 
previous 
reports 
of 
the 
association 
between 
elevations 
in 
BP 
and 
objectively 
measured 
SBD 
from 
a 
community-
based 
sample 
of 
children. 


The 
Tucson 
Children’s 
Assessment 
of 
Sleep 
Apnea 
study 
(TuCASA) 
was 
designed 
to 
investigate 
the 
prevalence 
and 


correlates 
of 
objectively 
measured 
SBD 
in 
a 
population-based 
cohort 
of 
preadolescent 
children.8 
TuCASA 
included 
BP 
measurements 
as 
part 
of 
its 
protocol 
and 
thus 
allowed 
us 
to 
investigate 
the 
relationship 
between 
BP 
elevation 
and 
SBD 
in 
children 
of 
this 
age 
group. 


METHODS
RECRUITMENT 


White 
and 
Hispanic 
children 
aged 
6 
to 
11 
years 
were 
recruited 
from 
elementary 
schools 
in 
Tucson, 
Ariz. 
The 
Tucson 
Unified 
School 
District 
(TUSD) 
is 
a 
large 
district 
with 
children 
representative 
of 
those 
living 
in 
southern 
Arizona. 
To 
recruit 
a 
final 
cohort 
that 
was 
approximately 
50% 
Hispanic, 
we 
selected 
elementary 
schools 
with 
25% 
to 
75% 
Hispanic 
students 
enrolled. 
We 
sent 
the 
parents 
of 
each 
child 
a 
1-page 
child’s 
sleep 
habits 
questionnaire, 
which 
focused 
on 
symptoms 
associated 
with 
SBD 
(Table 
1). 
The 
return 
rate 
of 
this 
screening 
instrument 
was 
approximately 
31%.9 
From 
parents 
who 
agreed 
to 
be 
contacted,

*Responses 
were 
checked 
as 
“don’t 
know; 
never; 
rarely; 
occasionally; 
frequently; 
or 
almost 
always.” 
Questions 
regarding 
birth 
date, 
sex, 
weight, 
height, 
and 
ethnicity 
were 
also 
asked. 


quested 
permission 
to 
perform 
an 
unattended 
polysomnogram 
(PSG) 
on 
the 
child 
in 
their 
home. 
The 
TuCASA 
protocol 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
University 
of 
Arizona 
Human 
Subjects 
Committee 
and 
TUSD 
Research 
Committee. 
Informed 
consent 
was 
obtained 
from 
a 
parent 
or 
legal 
guardian, 
and 
a 
children’s 
assent 
form 
approved 
by 
the 
institutional 
review 
board 
was 
completed 
by 
each 
child. 
Full 
details 
of 
the 
study 
design 
have 
been 
previously 
published.8 


HOME 
VISITS 


Visits 
to 
each 
child’s 
home 
were 
scheduled 
to 
occur 
approximately 
1 
hour 
before 
the 
child’s 
usual 
bedtime. 
One 
of 
the 
child’s 
parents 
was 
given 
a 
self-administered 
questionnaire 
that 
contained 
items 
concerning 
the 
child’s 
sleep 
habits, 
daytime 
activity 
levels, 
and 
whether 
either 
parent 
smoked 
cigarettes 
during 
the 
previous 
2 
months 
(parental 
smoking). 
The 
child’s 
height, 
weight, 
and 
arm 
and 
neck 
circumference 
(size) 
were 
measured 
using 
standardized 
techniques. 
Body 
mass 
index 
(BMI) 
was 
calculated 
as 
weight 
in 
kilograms 
divided 
by 
the 
square 
of 
height 
in 
meters. 
A 
categorical 
variable 
of 
obesity 
was 
defined 
as 
a 
BMI 
of 
greater 
than 
the 
95th 
percentile 
standardized 
for 
age, 
sex, 
and 
ethnicity.10,11 


After 
a 
few 
minutes 
of 
rest 
while 
seated, 
the 
child’s 
BP 
was 
measured 
in 
triplicate 
from 
the 
right 
arm 
using 
a 
portable 
mercury 
sphygmomanometer 
and 
standardized 
techniques.12 
The 
appropriate 
BP 
cuff 
was 
selected 
according 
to 
the 
measured 
arm 
size 
(upper 
arm 
circumferences 
of 
6-15 
cm 
for 
infants, 
16-22 
cm 
for 
children, 
and 
23-30 
cm 
for 
regular-sized 
adults). 
The 
initial 
cuff 
inflation 
pressure 
was 
determined 
by 
adding 
30 
mm 
Hg 
to 
the 
palpated 
systolic 
BP. 
Cuff 
deflation 
was 
at 
2 
mm/s. 
At 
least 
30 
seconds 
elapsed 
between 
each 
of 
the 
3 
successive 
measurements. 
The 
mean 
of 
the 
final 
2 
of 
3 
BP 
measurements 
was 
used 
for 
the 
analyses 
for 
this 
report. 
We 
defined 
BP 
elevation 
as 
a 
systolic 
and 
diastolic 
BP 
above 
the 
90th 
percentile 
when 
adjusted 
for 
age, 
height, 
and 
sex.7 


POLYSOMNOGRAPHY 


After 
BP 
was 
measured, 
the 
PSG 
procedure 
was 
explained 
to 
the 
parent(s) 
and 
child. 
The 
PSG 
electrodes 
and 
sensors 
were 
attached 
using 
a 
vest 
and 
a 
portable, 
battery-powered 
sleep 
recording 
system 
(PS-2 
SleepWatch; 
Compumedics 
Ltd, 
Abbots-
ford, 
Victoria, 
Australia). 
The 
system 
consists 
of 
a 
patient 
interface 
box 
containing 
amplifiers 
and 
filters 
to 
which 
electrodes 
and 
sensors 
are 
connected. 
The 
following 
signals 
were 
acquired 
as 
part 
of 
the 
TuCASA 
montage: 
C3/A2 
and 
C4/A1 
electroencephalogram, 
right 
and 
left 
electroculogram, 
a 
bipolar 
sub-
mental 
electromyogram, 
thoracic 
and 
abdominal 
displacement 
(inductive 
plethysmography 
bands), 
airflow 
(nasal/oral 
thermistor), 
nasal 
pressure 
cannula, 
finger 
pulse 
oximetry, 
single-
lead 
electrocardiogram, 
snoring 
(microphone), 
body 
position, 
and 
ambient 
light. 
The 
PSG 
signals 
were 
verified 
before 
the 
study 
team 
left 
the 
home. 
The 
equipment 
was 
removed 
the 


following 
morning, 
and 
the 
stored 
data 
were 
downloaded 
for 
review. 


The 
software 
system 
(W-series 
Replay, 
version 
2.0, 
release 
22; 
Compumedics 
Ltd) 
was 
used 
to 
process 
all 
PSGs. 
Scoring 
procedures 
have 
been 
previously 
described.8 
Sleep 
stages 
were 
scored 
according 
to 
the 
criteria 
of 
Rechtschaffen 
and 
Kales.13 
Arousals 
were 
identified 
using 
criteria 
published 
by 
the 
American 
Academy 
of 
Sleep 
Medicine.14 
Sleep 
efficiency 
was 
expressed 
by 
the 
total 
sleep 
time 
as 
a 
percentage 
of 
the 
sleep 
period 
time. 
The 
arousal 
index 
was 
calculated 
as 
the 
total 
number 
of 
arousals 
divided 
by 
the 
total 
sleep 
time. 
Apneas 
were 
scored 
if 
the 
amplitude 
(peak 
to 
trough) 
of 
the 
airflow 
signal 
using 
the 
thermistor 
decreased 
below 
at 
least 
25% 
of 
the 
amplitude 
of 
baseline 
breathing 
(identified 
during 
a 
period 
of 
regular 
breathing 
with 
stable 
oxygen 
levels), 
if 
this 
change 
lasted 
for 
more 
than 
6 
seconds 
or 
2 
breath 
cycles. 
Hypopneas 
were 
designated 
if 
the 
amplitude 
of 
any 
respiratory 
signal 
decreased 
below 
70% 
of 
the 
amplitude 
of 
baseline 
and 
if 
the 
thermistor 
signal 
did 
not 
meet 
the 
criterion 
for 
apnea. 
Central 
events 
were 
marked 
if 
no 
displacement 
was 
noted 
on 
both 
the 
chestand 
abdominalinductancechannels.Otherwise,events 
were 
scored 
as 
obstructive. 
For 
this 
analysis, 
the 
nasal 
pressure 
signal 
wasnotused 
todefineSBDevents.ThePSGswithless 
than4hours 
of 
a 
valid 
oximetry 
signal 
were 
classified 
as 
failed 
studies. 


After 
full 
scoring, 
analysis 
software 
was 
used 
to 
link 
each 
breathing 
event 
to 
data 
from 
the 
oxygen 
saturation 
and 
electroencephalogram 
channels. 
Respiratory 
events 
were 
marked 
independently 
of 
concomitant 
oxygen 
desaturation; 
this 
allowed 
characterization 
of 
events 
according 
to 
differing 
degrees 
of 
associated 
desaturations 
and 
arousals 
or 
various 
combinations 
of 
these 
measures. 
In 
this 
manner, 
the 
respiratory 
disturbance 
index 
(RDI) 
was 
defined 
as 
the 
number 
of 
respiratory 
events 
(apneas 
and 
hypopneas) 
per 
hour 
of 
the 
total 
sleep 
time. 
In 
addition, 
scoring 
software 
marked 
respiratory 
events 
in 
terms 
of 
associated 
desaturations 
(0%, 
2%, 
3%, 
or 
4%, 
with 
or 
without 
arousal). 


All 
studies 
were 
scored 
by 
a 
single 
registered 
PSG 
technologist, 
who 
was 
required 
to 
demonstrate 
a 
complete 
understanding 
of 
the 
study’s 
scoring 
rules 
and 
to 
articulate 
reasons 
for 
assigning 
epoch-by-epoch 
codes 
for 
sleep 
and 
respiratory 
scoring. 
Approximately 
5% 
of 
studies 
were 
rescored 
by 
the 
same 
scorer 
on 
a 
blinded 
basis 
to 
determine 
consistency 
in 
scoring. 
No 
systematic 
differences 
were 
observed 
between 
initial 
and 
rescored 
studies. 


STATISTICAL 
ANALYSIS 


All 
study 
results 
were 
entered 
or 
transferred 
to 
a 
computer 
database 
for 
data 
verification 
and 
cleaning. 
The 
data 
for 
this 
analysis 
were 
transferred 
to 
SPSS 
statistical 
software 
version 
10 
(SPSS 
Inc, 
Chicago, 
Ill) 
for 
statistical 
analyses. 
Descriptive 
statistics 
(distributions 
of 
continuous 
variables) 
were 
reviewed 
for 
normalcy 
and 
outliers. 
Exploratory 
univariate 
analyses 
of 
the 
key 
variables 
were 
performed 
using 
nominal/logistic 
regression 
and 


2 
analyses. 
Because 
RDI 
distributions 
were 
not 
normal, 
they 
were 
log 
transformed 
before 
analysis. 
Those 
variables 
associated 
with 
elevations 
in 
systolic 
or 
diastolic 
BP 
on 
univariate 
analyses 
were 
then 
used 
in 
multivariate 
nominal 
and 
logistic 
regression 
analyses. 
Diagnostic 
analyses 
to 
detect 
the 
presence 
of 
collinearity 
were 
performed 
for 
measures 
of 
body 
size, 
sleep 
quality, 
and 
indices 
of 
RDI.

to 
8-year 
age 
group, 
and 
12% 
were 
obese. 
A 
parent 
of 
15% 
of 
the 
children 
reported 
hearing 
the 
child 
snoring 
loudly 
(frequently 
or 
almost 
always). 
Fifteen 
(6%) 
had 
hypertension, 
and 
19% 
had 
parents 
who 
smoked 
cigarettes. 
See 
Table 
2 
for 
additional 
participant 
characteristics. 


Significant 
univariate 
associations 
were 
noted 
between 
elevations 
in 
systolic 
and 
diastolic 
BP 
and 
indices 
of 
body 
size, 
sleep 
fragmentation, 
and 
SBD. 
In 
exploratory 
analyses, 
we 
found 
qualitatively 
similar 
associations 
between 
systolic 
and 
diastolic 
BP 
elevation 
and 
RDI2%, 
RDI3%, 
and 
RDI4% 
but 
not 
RDI0%. 
However, 
because 
the 
absolute 
number 
of 
desaturation 
events 
for 
RDI2% 
was 
larger 
than 
for 
the 
other 
definitions 
of 
SBD, 
we 
elected 
to 
present 
only 
the 
data 
for 
RDI2% 
in 
Table 
3 
and 
to 
use 
this 
definition 
for 
subsequent 
multivariate 
analyses. 
In 
addition, 
we 
found 
that 
sleep 
efficiency 
and 
arousal 
index 
were 
colinear. 
Inasmuch 
as 
the 
best-
fitting 
multivariate 
model 
incorporated 
sleep 
efficiency, 
but 
not 
arousal 
index, 
data 
using 
the 
former 
are 
presented 
in 
Table 
3. 
Similarly, 
collinearity 
was 
observed 
for 
neck 
circumference, 
BMI, 
weight, 
and 
categorical

was 
associated 
with 
the 
most 
parsimonious 
model 
and 
is 
used 
in 
Table

as 
well. 
For 
systolic 
BP 
elevation, 
there 
were 
significant 
associations 
with 
habitual 
loud 
snoring, 
witnessed 
apnea, 
RDI2%, 
and 
poorer 
sleep 
efficiency. 
For 
diastolic 
BP 
elevation, 
relationships 
were 
observed 
with 
obesity, 
poorer 
sleep 
efficiency, 
RDI2%, 
and 
arousal 
index. 
Factors 
not 
associated 
with 
either 
systolic

hypertension 
were 
sex,

COMMENT
Obesity 
and 
hypertension 
are 
becoming 
a 
significant 
health 
problem 
in 
children.15 
In 
this 
study 
performed 
in 
a 
general 
population 
sample, 
children 
with 
elevations 
in 
BP 
were 
more 
likely 
to 
be 
obese, 
have 
poorer 
sleep, 
and 
have 
evidence 
of 
SBD. 
These 
data 
provide 
evidence 
that 
SBD 
and 
obesity 
contribute 
to 
the 
development 
of 
hypertension 
in 
children 
and 
adults. 


Our 
study 
provides 
evidence 
that 
SBD 
may 
be 
an 
important 
factor 
in 
the 
development 
of 
hypertension 
in 
children. 
To 
our 
knowledge, 
the 
only 
previous 
study 
of 
hypertension 
and 
SBD 
in 
children 
is 
that 
of 
Marcus 
and 
coworkers,16 
who 
studied 
a 
cohort 
of 
children 
referred 
to 
a 
sleep 
disorders 
center. 
These 
investigators 
found 
that 
mean 
diastolic 
BP 
measured 
automatically 
during 
both 
wakefulness 
and 
sleep 
was 
higher 
in 
young 
children 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
when 
compared 
with 
children 
with 
only 
snoring. 
The 
results 
of 
our 
study 
extend 
these 
findings 
by 
demonstrating 
an 
association 
between 
SBD 
and 
daytime 
hypertension 
in 
a 
large 
community-based 
sample 
of 
children. 
These 
findings 
may 
have 
significant 
implications 
for 
the 
health 
of 
children 
as 
they 
mature 
into 
adulthood. 
It 
is 
possible 
that 
children 
with 
unrecognized 
SBD 
and 
hypertension 
may

by 
many 
years 
of 
untreated 
BP 
elevation. 
Furthermore, 
children 
without 
hypertension 
but 
with 
unrecognized 
SBD 
may 
be 
at 
increased 
risk 
for 
developing 
hypertension 
as 
an 
adult. 


Elevations 
in 
BP 
during 
wakefulness 
were 
associated 
only 
with 
SBD 
events 
that 
resulted 
in 
some 
degree 
of 
oxygen 
desaturation. 
This 
observation 
is 
consistent 
with 
data 
from 
a 
large 
cohort 
of 
adults 
in 
which 
the 
risk 
of 
hypertension 
increased 
with 
the 
amount 
of 
nocturnal 
oxygen 
desaturation.2 
Furthermore, 
our 
results 
are 
consistent 
with 
data 
from 
animal 
models 
of 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea. 
Experimentally 
induced 
chronic 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
results 
in 
persistent 
daytime 
hypertension 
in 
dogs.17 
Moreover, 
an 
important 
factor 
in 
the 
development 
of 
hypertension 
in 
rats 
is 
episodic 
hypoxia.18 


We 
observed 
that 
poorer 
sleep 
efficiency 
was 
independently 
associated 
with 
both 
systolic 
and 
diastolic 
BP 
elevation. 
In 
many 
cases, 
poorer 
sleep 
efficiency 
is 
a 
reflection 
of 
cortical 
arousals 
and 
sleep 
fragmentation. 
This 
is 
consistent 
with 
our 
finding 
that 
the 
arousal 
index 
and 
sleep 
efficiency 
were 
colinear 
in 
our 
study 
population. 
Acute 
elevations 
in

occur 
in

Sleep-related 
breathing 
disorders 
are 
associated 
with 
BP 
elevation 
and 
obesity 
in 
adults. 
Our 
study 
observed 
this 
association 
in 
elementary 
school–aged 
children 
as 
well. 


tivity.19,20 
Thus, 
our 
data 
suggest 
that 
nocturnal 
arousals 
contribute 
to 
the 
development 
of 
daytime 
hypertension 
in 
children. 
However, 
they 
are 
not 
consistent 
with 
some 
experimental 
data 
in 
dogs17 
and 
adults2 
that 
indicate 
that 
sleep 
fragmentation 
is 
not 
important 
in 
the 
pathogenesis 
of 
daytime 
hypertension. 
These 
discrepancies 
may 
be 
explained 
by 
differences 
in 
the 
arousal 
response 
to 
apnea 
in 
children 
when 
compared 
with 
adults.21 


We 
observed 
that 
an 
elevation 
in 
diastolic 
BP 
was 
related 
to 
obesity. 
The 
importance 
of 
obesity 
has 
been 
emphasized 
as 
a 
remedial 
cause 
of 
hypertension 
in 
children.
15 
It 
is 
possible 
that 
the 
saying 
“The 
child 
is 
father 
of 
the 
man” 
is 
applicable 
because 
a 
child’s 
body 
habitus 
(obesity 
and 
thick 
neck) 
persists 
into 
adulthood. 
Thus, 
subtle 
increases 
of 
BP 
may 
result 
in 
frank 
hypertension 
as 
the 
child 
grows 
into 
adulthood.22 
Longitudinal 
studies 
will 
be 
necessary 
to 
study 
this 
hypothesis, 
but 
meanwhile 
our 
results 
add 
to 
the 
accumulating 
body 
of 
evidence 
that 
childhood 
obesity 
is 
not 
benign. 


A 
limitation 
of 
our 
study 
is 
the 
lack 
of 
recordings 
of 
leg 
movement. 
Our 
sleep 
recorder 
did 
not 
have 
enough 
bandwidth 
to 
add 
another 
electromyogram 
channel. 
Periodic 
leg 
movements 
are 
one 
mechanism 
known 
to 
increase 
the 
arousal 
index 
and 
are 
associated 
with 
inattention 
in 
children.23 
Differences 
in 
BP 
and 
SBD 
may 
be 
present 
in 
children 
from 
ethnic 
groups 
that 
we 
did 
not 
study 
(African 
American, 
Asian 
American, 
and 
American 
Indian, 
for 
instance). 
Finally, 
we 
acknowledge 
that 
our 
definition 
of 
BP 
elevation 
includes 
those 
children 
who 
are 
considered 
to 
have 
high 
normal 
pressures 
(90th 
and 


95th 
percentile) 
and 
those 
considered 
hypertensive 
(95th 
percentile).12 
Nevertheless, 
our 
data 
demonstrate 
an 
association 
between 
SBD 
and 
this 
definition 
of 
BP 
elevation. 
Moreover, 
it 
has 
been 
recommended 
that 
children 
with 
high 
normal 
values 
be 
further 
observed 
and 
other 
risk 
factors 
evaluated.12
