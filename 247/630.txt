Summary The most common sleep disorder in children is obstructive sleep apnea 
syndrome (OSAS). The majority of children with OSAS improve following tonsillectomy 
and adenoidectomy (T&A). T&A as an outpatient procedure in children is very 
common. Young age in considered risk factors for postoperative respiratory 
complications. The purpose of this study is to analyze our experience with 
postoperative T&A complications in patients younger than 2 years of age. A total of 
39 T&A were performed in children younger than 2 years of age. OSAS diagnosis was 
confirmed by overnight polysomnography (PSG). All the patients were hospitalized 
and monitored by overnight pulse oximetry monitoring. Post-operatively there was 
marked improvement in respiratory function in all the patients comparing pre-and 
post-operative nadir oxygen saturation (P B 
0.05). Complications were documented 
in seven patients (20%). Five of the complications occurred in children older than 1 
year of age. Bleeding occurred in two patients (5.7%). Three patients (8.6%) had 
dehydration, one patient (2.9%) had hypercarbia and one patient had laryngospasm. 
In this study there was a low incidence of peri-and post-operative respiratory 
complications in children younger than 2 years of age who undergo T&A for OSAS. 
Identification of OSAS severity may be an important factor in determining the risk of 
T&A in a young child.

infants [1]. The overall prevalence of OSAS has 
been estimated in children at 1. 
2% [2], and the 
cause of OSAS suggested as a combination of 
neuromuscular and structural factors [3]. The 
most common structural problem is adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy [4,5], and the majority of children 
with OSAS improve following tonsillectomy and 
adenoidectomy (T&A) [1,6. 
8]. Potential complications 
of T&A include anesthetic complications and 
immediate postoperative problems such as pain,

poor oral intake and hemorrhage [8]. In addition, in 
the immediate post operative period, patients with 
OSAS may develop respiratory complications, such 
as worsening of OSAS or pulmonary edema [8]. 
Those complications are uncommon, thus T&A as 
an outpatient procedure in children has been 
widely reported and is advocated by numerous 
investigators [9. 
13]. There are several risk factors 
for postoperative respiratory complications such as 
failure to thrive (FTT), obesity, post prematurity, 
cardiac complications of OSAS (right ventricular 
hypertrophy), craniofacial anomaly, neuromuscular 
disorders, recent respiratory infection and severe 
OSAS in polysomnography [8]. Some authors found 
that children younger than 3 years with OSAS are 
also more prone to developing postoperative respiratory 
complications [11,14. 
18], but others 
reported complication rates similar to those of 
older children [19. 
21]. Recently, the subcommittee 
on OSAS of the American Academy of Pediatrics 
published their clinical practice guideline for 
diagnosis and management of OSAS in children 
[8]. Their recommendation included as risk factors, 
children younger than 3 years of age, and children 
with severe OSAS undergoing T&A requiring overnight 
hospitalization and monitoring with pulse 
oximetry in the immediate post-operative period. 

At our institution the main indication for T&A in 
children younger than 2 years of age is OSAS. 
Postoperatively, these young children are hospitalized 
in a pediatric department for monitoring. A 
retrospective study was undertaken to analyze our 
experience with postoperative T&A complications 
in patients younger than 2 years of age. 

2. Methods 
2.1. Patients 
A retrospective review was undertaken of the 
charts of all children who had T&A due to OSAS 
during the years 1999. 
2001 at Soroka University 
Medical Center, Beer-Sheva, Israel. The inclusion 
criteria were infants younger than 2 years of age 
with OSAS proven by polysomnography (PSG). 
Diagnostic evaluation included a detailed clinical 
history obtained using a standard questionnaire 
[22], physical examination by a pediatrician and 
pediatric otolaryngologist, and an overnight PSG. 
All patients had an T&A. Bipolar or electrocautery 
were used during all the surgeries. All the patients 
were hospitalized in a pediatric ward for at least 
the night following the surgery. Overnight pulse 
oximetry monitoring was done to all patients. 
Children with complicating factors such as any 

other surgery, blood dyscrasias, immune system 
compromise and craniofacial anomalies were excluded. 
However, children with other chronic 
medical illnesses such as prematurity, bronchopulmonary 
dysplasia, cyanotic spells, asthma, laryngomalacia, 
cardiac valve abnormality, pulmonary 
hypertension and FTT were included in our study. 
The medical records were reviewed retrospectively 
and data were obtained on patient age, gender, 
coexisting medical problems, respiratory disturbance 
index (RDI), nadir SaO2 recorded during the 
PSG (preoperative desaturation), the nadir SaO2 
recorded during the night following surgery (postoperative 
desaturation), anesthesia technique and 
complications. Complications were defined as any 
of the following: (1) airway complications such as 
oxygen desaturation below 90%, (2) hemorrhage 
within 24 h of surgery (immediate) and after 24 h of 
surgery (delayed), (3) dehydration* 
inadequate 
oral intake after discharge requiring readmission 
to the hospital for intravenous hydration. Complications 
were reviewed to determine type, time of 
occurrence, intervention required, and need for 
extended hospital stay and for PICU admission. The 
institutional ethics committee approved the study 
protocol. 

2.2. Polysomnographic evaluation 
Children were studied a few days to 12 weeks 
prior to T&A. The mean duration from the PSG 
study until surgery was 1.89/1.1 months, for 
children less than 12 months was 1.29/0.8 months. 
PSG study was done using a computerized commercially 
available sleep monitoring system (Sensor-
Medics Inc, Yorba Linda, CA, USA) and streamed 
through to an optical disk. All the PSG tests were 
full overnight PSG done in our pediatric sleep 
laboratory according to ATS recommendations 

[23] as previously described [24]. 
2.3. Scoring 
Scoring was done by a trained technician, reviewed 
by a trained polysomnographer and a report 
was sent to the referring pediatric otolaryngologist. 
Sleep/wake and sleep stages were scored 
according to Rechtschaffen and Kales criteria 
[25]. Obstructive apneic and hypopneic events 
were scored according to the recommended pediatric 
criteria of the American Thoracic Society [23]. 
Obstructive apnea was defined as paradoxical 
breathing for at least two respiratory cycles with 
complete cessation of nasal airflow (airflow reduction 
of at least 80%). A hypopnea was scored when 
the paradoxical breathing was accompanied by a 


Complications of adenotonsillectomy in children with OSAS younger than 2 years of age 

reduction of at least 50% in airflow, resulting in 
either an arousal or in oxygen desaturation of at 
least 4%. The RDI was calculated as the number of 
respiratory events (apnea/hypopnea) per hour of 
sleep. The oxygen saturation variables included 
mean and nadir SaO2 and the desaturation index 
(DI) [the number of desaturation events (SaO2 
decrease of at least 4%) per hour of sleep]. 

2.4. Post-operative observation 
All the patients were hospitalized for at least one 
night post operation. All the patients were monitored 
by pulse oximeter (Biox 3700, Ohmeda, 
USA). Any respiratory compromise such as an apnea 
event, desaturation, frequent need for repositioning 
of the child in bed or increased respiratory 
effort were recorded in the patient’s chart by the 
medical staff. 

2.5. Data analyses 
Data are presented as mean9/S.D. The null 
hypothesis was rejected at the 5% level. In order 
to assess the relationship between post-T&A complications 
and OSAS severity, we also analyzed the 
data for three different patient groups according to 
their RDI. Mild OSA was defined as RDIB 
three 
events/h, moderate OSA was defined as RDI between 
three and ten events/h; and severe OSA was 
defined as RDI. 
ten events/h of sleep [26]. 

3. Results 
A total of 39 T&A were performed on children 
younger than 2 years of age, with OSAS proven by 
PSG. Four patients were excluded due to incomplete 
data. There were 24 males and 11 females. 
The patients’ ages ranged between 6 and 23 
months (average 15.86, S.D. 4.85), of whom ten 
were younger than 12 months and 25 were older 
than 12 months of age. Four patients had laryngomalacia, 
two patients had mild asthma, four 
patients were born as premature infants (gestational 
age of 27. 
33 weeks), two patients had 
periventricular hemorrhage and bronchopulmonary 
dysplasia, one patient had pulmonary hypertension 
and one patient had a ventricular septal defect. 
The age distribution and OSAS severity are shown in 
Table 1. All the patients were anaesthetized with 
nitric oxide and halothane. Atropine was used in 11 
patients, Scolin in eight patients, Pentothal in six 
patients and Fentanyl in only three patients. Postoperatively 
there was marked improvement in 
respiratory function in all the patients comparing 

pre-and post-operative maximal desaturation as 
shown in Fig. 1. The difference between pre-and 
post-operation nadir saturation in the moderate 
and severe OSAS groups was statistically significant 
(P B 
0.05). Complications were documented in 
seven patients (20%), as shown in Table 2. Five of 
the complications occurred in children older than 1 
year of age. Airway complications occurred in only 
two patients, both with severe OSAS: one patient 
(2.9%) had hypercarbia that resolved spontaneously 
after 20 min, and one patient was reintubated in 
the operating room due to laryngospasms and 
extubated 1 h later with no further complications. 

Bleeding occurred in two patients (5.7%): in one 
of them it was immediate, in the other, 7 days postoperative. 
Three patients (8.6%) had dehydration, 
Postoperative complication were not related to the 
type of anesthesia. 

4. Discussion 
The results of the present study show a low rate 
of respiratory complications in the immediate 
postoperative period, and that the main risk factor 
that predicts post-operative airway complications 
after T&A in younger children (5 
2 years of age) is 
OSAS severity as defined by PSG data, namely RDI 
of ] 
ten events/h. 

Several studies were done to assess and determine 
the risk factors for patients who might need 
post-operative special care. The purpose of this 
study was to present the incidence of post T&A 
complications at our medical center in young 
children with proven OSAS. Ruboyianes et al. [15] 
reported a high rate of postoperative airway 
complications in children younger than 3 years of 
age. There were 44 patients in his study and the 
range of age of the patients was 9 months. 
16 
years. Rosen et al. [16] found more post-operative 
complications in children younger than 2 years of 
age. However, all the young children with postoperative 
complications in his study had associated 
medical problems such as craniofacial anomalies, 
low muscle tone, FTT, cor pulmonale and recurrent 
pneumonia. McColley et al. [17] also found that 
OSAS patients younger than 3 years of age were at 
higher risk for complications post-T&A especially 
respiratory complications. However, 39% of the 
children in that study had additional medical 
problems such as cardiac and craniofacial abnormalities. 
Wiatrak et al. [14] found that the overall 
post-T&A complication rate in young OSAS children 
is similar to that in older children. However, their 
percentage of airway-related complications is 
higher. Not all the patients in that study had a

pre-operative PSG, so there are no data about their 
OSAS severity. Wilson et al. [27] found that the 
most important factor in predicting post-T&A 
complications was OSAS severity, and that the 
patient’s age had a relatively small role as a 
predictive value. Helfaer et al. [28] reported that 
young children with mild OSAS do not have increased 
risk for postoperative complications. In our 
study only two patients (both with severe OSAS) 
had airway complications (5.71%). One of them (21 
months old) had hypercapnea that resolved spontaneously 
after 20 min. The other child (7 months 
old) was reintubated due to laryngospasm and 
extubated 1 h later. The incidence of laryngospasm 
in our study is similar to the incidence of post-

factors maintaining airway patency and those 
promoting airway collapse is perturbed [18].This 
balance is determined by the interactions between 
central ventilatory responses to hypoxia, hypercapnea, 
anatomic size and resistance of the upper 
airway, and the upper airway neromuscular tone. In 
patients with neruromuscular dysfunction, relief of 
the anatomic obstruction can, paradoxically, cause 
worsening of the upper airway obstruction because 
of maladjustment. Several causes may augment 
the breach of the balance such as non-complete 
maturation of the system, residual effect of 
opioids, sedatives as analgesic agents, and the 
presence of other systemic illnesses. 

In the present study, patients with complicating 
medical problems such as any other surgery, blood 
dyscrasias, immune system compromise and craniofacial 
anomalies were excluded. However, children 
with other chronic medical illnesses such as 
prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, cyanotic 
spells, asthma, laryngomalacia, cardiac valve abnormality, 
pulmonary hypertension and FTT were 
included in our study. Postoperative complications 
were not related to the type of anesthesia; this is 
similar to other reports [17,27,28,30]. Overnight 
PSG should be considered for young children with

symptoms suggesting severe OSAS. Documentation 
of severe OSAS may be then helpful for a more 
careful postoperative care. 

In summary, as opposed to other publications, at 
this study a low rate of peri-and post T&A 
respiratory complications was found in a group of 
children younger than 2 years of age. However, all 
the patiensts with respiratory complications had 
severe OSAS. Upon those results, identification of 
OSAS severity may be an important factor in 
determining the risk of post T&A respiratory 
complications in a young child. Because there is 
no formal classification of OSAS severity in children, 
further prospective studies are needed in 
order to refine the polysomnographic and clinical 
factors that will best determine the risk of T&A in 
young patients.
