Summary 


Objective: 
To determine the efficacy of powered intracapsular tonsillectomy (PIT, 

e.g. regrowthrate)in childrenwho underwentPITatthree different institutions.We 
also wanted to determine if the trend to greater safety through reduced bleeding and 
re-admission for dehydration, noted in our initial reports, would become statistically 
significant in a larger sample. 
Study 
design 
and 
setting: 
Multi-center retrospective case series. 
Patients 
and 
methods: 
We retrospectively reviewed all charts’ of children who 
underwent PITat three different institutions: the Children’s Hospital at the Cleveland 
Clinic, Alfred I. DuPont Hospital for Children, and the New York Otolaryngology 
Institute. For comparison, we reviewed the outpatient and inpatient records of all 
children who underwent conventional tonsillectomy performed by the same surgeons 
at the Children’s Hospital at the Cleveland Clinic and Alfred I. DuPont Hospital for 
Children during the same period.No comparison group was available for the NewYork 
Otolaryngology Institute group. Three outcome measures were recorded: regrowth,

All 
statistical 
analyses 
were 
performed 
using

considered 
statistically 
significant. 
Results: 
We 
identified 
870 
children 
that 
underwent 
PIT 
at 
three 
different 
institutions. 
In 
addition, 
1121 
children 
underwent 
conventional 
tonsillectomy 
at 
two 
of 
the 
three 
institutions. 
The 
mean 
follow-up 
for 
the 
PIT 
group 
was 
1.2 
years 
(range, 
0.1—2.6 
years) 
and 
1.5 
years 
(range, 
0.1—3.0 
years) 
for 
the 
conventional 
tonsillectomy 
group.

When 
comparing 
conventional 
tonsillectomy 
to 
PIT, 
the 
bleeding 
rate, 
re-admission 
for 
dehydration, 
and 
the

Conclusion: 
PIT 
is 
a 
safe 
and 
effective 
technique 
in 
the 
management 
of 
obstructive

in 
children. 
PIT 
has 
the

Introduction 
Obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
(OSA) 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
common 
conditions 
in 
children 
that 
result 
in 
referral 
to 
a 
pediatric 
otolaryngologist. 
In 
most 
cases, 
OSA 
is 
treated 
with 
adenotonsillectomy. 
Obstruction 
of 
the 
airway 
can 
be 
due 
to 
enlarged 
adenoids, 
enlarged 
tonsils, 
or 
both. 
However, 
it 
is 
the 
surgical 
removal 
of 
the 
tonsils 
that 
is 
associated 
with 
the 
post-operative 
complications 
of 
pain, 
dehydration, 
and 
postoperative 
hemorrhage. 
Conventional 
tonsillectomy 
can 
be 
performed 
using 
a 
variety 
of 
technical 
means, 
including 
cold 
dissection, 
electrocautery, 
microbipolar 
cautery, 
and 
more 
recently, 
coblation 
[1,2]. 
Although 
effective, 
conventional 
tonsillectomy 
is 
associated 
with 
a 
difficult 
recovery 
in 
children 
due 
to 
prolonged 
post-operative 
pain 
and 
delayed 
hemorrhage, 
the 
latter 
of 
which 
affects 
1—3% 
of 
patients 
[1]. 
Pain 
occurs 
because 
total 
tonsillectomy 
predisposes 
the 
pharyngeal 
musculature 
to 
injury, 
bacterial 
colonization 
and 
subsequent 
inflammation. 
Bleeding 
remains 
a 
risk 
until 
the 
primary 
tonsillar 
feeding 
vessels 
have 
healed. 


The 
Institute 
of 
Medicine 
(IOM) 
reports 
have 
challenged 
physicians 
to 
focus 
on 
safety 
for 
all 
medical 
care 
delivered 
to 
patients 
and 
particularly, 
when 
surgical 
procedures 
are 
performed 
[3].Since 
tonsillectomy 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
common 
surgical 
procedures 
performed 
on 
children 
in 
the 
United 
States, 
improvements 
in 
safety 
while 
ensuring 
efficacy, 
appears 
essential. 
To 
reduce 
the 
morbidity 
of 
children 
who 
must 
undergo 
tonsillectomy, 
we 
developed 
a 
new 
technique 
called 
powered 
intracapsular 
tonsillectomy 
(PIT), 
which 
we 
began 
performing 
in 
1996. 
In 
this 
procedure, 
the 
tonsils 
are 
shaved 
away 
using 
an 
endoscopic 
microdebrider. 
Thetonsillar 
capsuleispreserved, 
which 
acts 
as 
a 


biologic 
dressing 
for 
the 
pharyngeal 
muscles. 
We 
previously 
reported 
that 
PIT 
significantly 
reduces 
post-operative 
pain, 
allows 
for 
a 
faster 
and 
easier 
recovery, 
and 
is 
as 
equally 
effective 
in 
eliminating 
the 
source 
of 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
as 
conventional 
‘‘total’’ tonsillectomy. 
A 
trend 
towards 
reduced 
post-operative 
hemorrhage 
and 
re-admission 
for 
dehydration 
was 
also 
noted, 
but 
statistical 
significance 
was 
not 
observed 
due 
to 
the 
modest 
number 
of 
patients 
[4,5]. 


One 
important 
concern 
about 
the 
efficacy 
of 
PIT 
is 
the 
possibility 
of 
tonsillar 
regrowth 
resulting 
in 
subsequent 
problems 
with 
recurrence 
of 
obstruction 
and 
infection. 
There 
are 
historical 
reports 
of 
regrowth 
after 
partial 
removal 
of 
the 
tonsils, 
but 
only 
in 
a 
small 
percentage 
of 
cases 
[6]. 
The 
goal 
of 
this 
study 
was 
to 
determine 
the 
regrowth 
rate 
in 
children 
who 
underwent 
PIT 
at 
three 
different 
institutions. 
Regrowth 
after 
PIT 
has 
not 
been 
previously 
reported. 
We 
also 
wanted 
to 
determine 
if 
the 
increased 
safety 
of 
reduced 
bleeding 
and 
re-admission 
for 
dehydration, 
noted 
in 
our 
initial 
report, 
would 
become 
statistically 
significant 
in 
a 
larger 
sample. 


2. 
Patients 
and 
methods 
2.1. 
Patients 
We 
retrospectively 
reviewed 
the 
outpatient 
and 
inpatient 
medical 
records 
of 
all 
children 
who 
underwent 
PIT 
at 
three 
different 
institutions: 
The 
Children’s 
Hospital 
at 
the 
Cleveland 
Clinic, 
Cleveland, 
OH 
(1998—2002); 
Alfred 
I. 
DuPont 
Hospital 
for 
Children, 
Wilmington, 
DE 
(2000—2002), 
and 
the 
New 
York 
Otolaryngology 
Institute, 
NYC, 
NY 
(2000— 


Safety 
and 
efficacy 
of 
powered 
intracapsular 
tonsillectomy 
in

2002). 
The 
surgical 
procedure 
for 
PIT, 
which 
was 
followed 
by 
all 
surgeons 
in 
this 
study, 
has 
been 
described 
previously 
[4]. 
For 
comparison, 
we 
reviewed 
the 
outpatient 
and 
inpatient 
records 
of 
all 
children 
who 
underwent 
conventional 
tonsillectomy 
performed 
by 
the 
same 
surgeons 
at 
the 
Children’s 
Hospital 
at 
the 
Cleveland 
Clinic 
(1998—2002) 
and 
Alfred 
I. 
DuPont 
Hospital 
for 
Children 
(2000— 
2002) 
during 
the 
same 
period 
for 
the 
same 
indications. 
The 
conventional 
tonsillectomy 
group 
was 
comparable 
to 
the 
PIT 
group 
in 
disease 
severeness 
and 
gender 
distribution. 
Patients 
in 
the 
PIT 
group 
were 
slightly 
younger. 
No 
comparison 
group 
was 
available 
for 
the 
New 
York 
Otolaryngology 
Institute 
group. 
Using 
the 
data 
from 
the 
medical 
records, 
we 
recorded 
three 
outcome 
measures: 
regrowth, 
bleeding 
and 
re-admission 
for 
dehydration 
rates. 


The 
caregivers 
were 
left 
to 
decide 
whether 
their 
child 
would 
undergo 
PIT 
or 
conventional 
tonsillectomy 
after 
a 
full 
consultation 
with 
the 
operating 
surgeon. 
During 
the 
pre-operative 
consultation, 
we 
told 
the 
caregivers 
that 
our 
experience 
suggested 
that 
children 
who 
have 
PIT 
may 
have 
less 
post-operative 
discomfort 
than 
those 
who 
have 
conventional 
tonsillectomy. 
They 
were 
also 
told 
that 
there 
was 
a 
risk 
of 
tonsillar 
regrowth 
following 
partial 
resection. 
Patients 
in 
both 
groups 
were 
seen 
on 
follow-up 
in 
the 
outpatient 
clinic 
at 
approximately 
1 
month 
and 
at 
6 
months. 
Some 
patients 
had 
longer 
follow-ups 
due 
to 
non-related 
otolaryngologic 
problems. 
In 
addition, 
a 
phone 
survey 
of 
caregivers 
was 
conducted 
on 
all 
patients 
(i.e. 
patients 
that 
underwent 
conventional 
tonsillectomy 
and 
patients 
that 
underwent 
PIT) 
to 
asses 
whether 
there 
had 
been 
recurrence 
of 
OSDB 
symptoms. 


The 
Institutional 
Review 
Board 
at 
the 
Cleveland 
Clinic 
Foundation 
approved 
this 
study.

Statistical 
methods 
The 
bleeding 
rate, 
re-admission 
for 
dehydration 
rate, 
combined 
major 
complication 
rate 
(obtained 


by 
adding 
the 
bleeding 
and 
re-admission 
for 
dehydration 
rates) 
and 
regrowth 
rate 
and 
their 
corresponding 
95% 
CI 
were 
estimated 
for 
the 
patients 
who 
underwent 
PIT 
by 
combining 
the 
data 
from 
the 
three 
centers 
and 
using 
the 
sample 
size 
as 
the 
weight 
for 
each 
study. 
In 
addition, 
the 
bleeding 
rate, 
re-admission 
for 
dehydration 
rate 
and 
major 
complication 
rate 
were 
compared 
between 
the 
conventional 
tonsillectomy 
and 
PIT 
groups 
using 
combined 
data 
from 
the 
Children’s 
Hospital 
at 
the 
Cleveland 
Clinic 
and 
Alfred 
I. 
DuPont 
Hospital 
for 
Children 
and 
the

All 
statistical 
analyses 
were 
performed 
using 
SAS, 
and 
P

was 
considered 
statistically 
significant.

tonsillar 
regrowth 
as 
well 
as 
major 
complications 
after 
tonsillectomy 


(i.e. 
post-operative 
bleeding 
and 
re-admission 
for 
dehydration). 
Our 
findings 
suggest 
that 
PIT 
is 
associated 
with 
a 
low 
incidence 
of 
regrowth 
and 
a 
low 
incidence 
of 
major 
complications 
in 
a 
large 
series 
of 
children 
at 
multiple 
participating 
centers. 
The 
risk 
of 
tonsillar 
regrowth 
is 
a 
major 
concern 
after 
partial 
removal 
of 
the 
tonsils. 
A 
review 
of 
the 
historical 
literature 
demonstrates 
a 
precedent 
for 
this 
concern. 
In 
1899, 
F.E. 
Hopkins 
addressed 
the 
issue 
of 
recurrence 
of 
the 
tonsil 
after 
surgery. 
Along 
with 
his 
case 
report, 
he 
found 
seven 
other 
papers 
documenting 
regrowth 
following 
tonsillotomy, 
or 
partial 
tonsil 
removal. 
He 
concluded 
that 
recurrence 
of 
any 
considerable 
enlargement 
of 
remaining 
tonsil 
tissue 
was 
due 
to 
insufficient 
removal 
during 
the 
first 
operation 
[6]. 


Robertson 
proposed 
separating 
diseased 
tonsils 
into 
those 
producing 
a 
mechanical 
obstruction 
and 
those 
prone 
to 
infection, 
and 
agreed 
that 
partial 
excision 
was 
sufficient 
in 
the 
former, 
but 
recommended 
complete 
removal 
in 
the 
latter 
[7]. 
In 
the 
early 
1900s, 
several 
methods 
of 
complete 
removal 
of 
the 
tonsils 
or 
tonsillectomy 
were 
described 
[8].In 
the 
next 
30 
years, 
a 
debate 
occurred 
in 
the 
medical 
literature 
weighing 
the 
advantages 
and 
disadvantages 
of 
tonsillotomy 
versus 
tonsillectomy 
[9,10].In 
1925, 
indications 
for 
both 
procedures 
were 
specified 
by 
Portmann 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Bordeaux, 
who 
recommended 
partial 
removal 
of 
tonsil 
tissue 
in 
cases 
in 
which 
‘‘obstruction 
was 
the 
chief 
difficulty’’ 
and 
complete 
removal 
for 
the 
‘‘diseased 
types’’ 

[11]. 
A 
new 
important 
concept 
that 
appeared 
in 
the 
literature 
was 
the 
distinction 
between 
an 
extra-
capsular 
and 
intracapsular 
tonsillectomy 
introduced 
by 
G. 
Hudson 
Makuen. 
He 
recommended 
intracapsular 
tonsillectomy, 
an 
operation 
in 
which 
a 
thin 
layer 
of 
the 
capsule 
was 
left 
as 
a 
lining 
for 
the 
tonsilar 
fossa, 
which 
was 
meant 
to 
serve 
as 
a 
wall 
of 
defense 
against 
infection 
[12]. 


Roberts 
reinforced 
the 
concept 
of 
tonsillectomy 
over 
tonsillotomy 
stating 
that 
‘‘evidence 
that 
a 
tonsil 
thoroughly 
removed 
ever 
grows 
is 
lacking’’ 
[13]. 
Comments 
like 
this 
can 
be 
found 
as 
recently 
as 
1977 
[14]. 
Kaiser 
published 
a 
series 
of 
2200 
patients 
after 
3 
and 
10 
years 
following 
a 
tonsil 
operation 
and 
reported 
that 
tonsillotomies 
were 
not 
as 
effective 
as 
complete 
tonsil 
removal 
[15]. 
Rhoads 
and 
Dick 
published 
their 
study 
of 
403 
patients 
who 
had 
had 
more 
than 
one 
tonsil 
operation 
and 
concluded 
that 
there 
were 
instances 
in 
which 
the 
condition 
resulting 
from 
incomplete 
tonsillectomy 
was 
worse 
than 
the 
initial 
problem 
[16]. 
Case 
reports 
of 
patients 
with 
systemic 
diseases 
attributable 
to 
infected 
tonsils 
that 
failed 
to 
improve 
after 
tonsillotomy, 
but 
improved 
after 
removal 
of 
residual 
tonsillar 
tissue 
are 
well 
documented 
[17]. 


By 
the 
1930s, 
complete 
excision 
or 
tonsillectomy 
had 
become 
the 
standard 
of 
care 
in 
the 
United 
States, 
regardless 
of 
the 
indication 
for 
the 
operation. 
As 
a 
result, 
the 
concept 
of 
partial 
removal 
of 
tonsil 
tissue 
or 
tonsillotomy 
was 
totally 
abandoned. 
During 
this 
time, 
authors 
like 
Gleason 
and 
Fowler 
discussed 
tonsillotomy 
as 
a 
historical 
procedure 
[18,19]. 
Although 
the 
debate 
of 
guillotine 
versus 
dissection 
continued 
in 
England 
into 
the 
1940s, 
the 
objective 
of 
tonsil 
surgery 
at 
that 
time 
was 
clear: 
‘‘our 
aim 
must 
be 
to 
remove 
the 
tonsil, 
the 
whole 
tonsil, 
and 
nothing 
but 
the 
tonsil’’ regardless 
of 
the 
instrument(s) 
used 
[20]. 


Lately, 
European 
physicians 
have 
revisited 
the 
concept 
of 
tonsillotomy. 
Two 
Russian 
physicians 
described 
the 
use 
of 
a 
Bochon 
loop 
for 
the 
partial 
removal 
of 
hypertrophic 
tonsils 
in 
children 
in 
1993, 
and 
proposed 
that 
this 
procedure 
preserves 
the 
relevant 
physiological 
function 
of 
the 
tonsil 
while 
reducing 
the 
duration 
of 
treatment 
and 
preventing 
chronic 
inflammation 
[21]. 
Two 
groups 
in 
Sweden 



Safety 
and 
efficacy 
of 
powered 
intracapsular 
tonsillectomy 
in 
children 


have 
reported 
their 
experience 
with 
tonsillotomy 
for 
the 
relief 
of 
obstructive 
symptoms 
in 
children 
using 
a 
CO2 
laser. 
These 
studies 
showed 
that 
tonsillotomy 
is 
effective 
in 
relieving 
obstructive 
symptoms, 
while 
reducing 
post-operative 
pain, 
parent 
distress, 
surgical 
time 
and 
overall 
cost. 
After 
a 
follow-up 
period 
of 
2 
years, 
there 
was 
no 
indication 
of 
recurrence 
of 
obstructive 
symptoms 
in 
the 
majority 
of 
patients. 
No 
comments 
were 
made 
regarding 
regrowth 
of 
the 
remaining 
tonsil 
tissue 
after 
surgery 
in 
any 
of 
the 
studies 
[22—24]. 


In 
the 
United 
States, 
a 
surgical 
technique 
to 
remove 
only 
a 
portion 
of 
the 
tonsil 
using 
cryosurgery 
was 
described 
in 
an 
animal 
model 
as 
early 
as 
1965 
[25]. 
Hill 
reported 
his 
experience 
with 
46 
adults 
who 
had 
undergone 
this 
procedure 
and 
found 
that 
the 
amount 
of 
discomfort 
was 
about 
50% 
of 
that 
of 
surgical 
removal 
and 
that 
the 
amount 
of 
tissue 
destruction 
was 
about 
40%. 
No 
comments 
on 
regrowth 
of 
remaining 
tonsil 
tissue 
were 
made 
[26]. 
By 
the 
1980s, 
this 
procedure 
was 
abandoned 
due 
to 
the 
cost, 
inconveniences 
of 
handling 
liquid 
nitrogen, 
reports 
of 
post-operative 
bleeding 
and 
accounts 
of 
life-threatening 
post-operative 
edema 
[27]. 
More 
recently, 
Lee 
et 
al. 
described 
the 
removal 
of 
90—95% 
of 
the 
tonsil 
using 
ionized 
field 
ablation 
for 
19 
children 
with 
obstructive 
tonsillar 
hypertrophy 
[2]. 
Unfortunately, 
these 
patients 
were 
followed 
post-operatively 
only 
for 
a 
14-day 
period, 
and 
thus 
the 
risk 
of 
tonsillar 
regrowth 
was 
not 
assessed. 
A 
larger 
series 
of 
528 
patients 
was 
published 
by 
the 
same 
group 
with 
a 
follow-up 
period 
of 
a 
minimum 
of 
4 
weeks 
after 
surgery, 
but 
again, 
no 
comments 
on 
regrowth 
of 
remaining 
tonsil 
tissue 
were 
made 
[28]. 
Our 
technique 
differs 
significantly 
from 
previously 
reported 
techniques 
for 
tonsillotomy 
[4]. 
The 
microdebrider 
allows 
the 
surgeon 
to 
control 
the 
amount 
of 
tonsil 
tissue 
that 
is 
removed, 
leaving 
minimal 
tonsil 
remnants. 
These 
tonsil 
remnants 
are 
then 
electrodessicated 
to 
form 
a 
mature 
eschar 
over 
the 
intact 
tonsillar 
capsule. 


As 
our 
medical 
knowledge 
improves 
and 
the 
indications 
for 
tonsil 
surgery 
become 
more 
refined, 
it 
makes 
sense 
to 
revisit 
the 
concept 
of 
the 
partial 
removal 
of 
tonsil 
tissue 
for 
the 
surgical 
management 
of 
tonsillar 
hypertrophy 
causing 
obstructive 
sleep 
disordered 
breathing 
in 
children. 
To 
our 
knowledge, 
this 
report 
is 
the 
most 
comprehensive 
examination 
of 
tonsillar 
tissue 
regrowth 
after 
partial 
resection 
and, 
in 
our 
experience, 
is 
a 
rare 
event 
occurring 
in 
0.46% 
of 
cases, 
usually 
during 
the 
first 
or 
second 
post-operative 
year. 
We 
have 
found 
the 
few 
cases 
to 
be 
amenable 
to 
completion 
tonsillectomy. 


In 
addition 
to 
tonsillar 
regrowth, 
post-tonsillectomy 
hemorrhage 
is 
another 
concern. 
In 
fact, 
hemorrhage 
is 
still 
the 
most 
significant 
complication 


associated 
with 
tonsillectomy, 
generally 
occurring 
in 
1—3% 
of 
cases 
[1]. 
However, 
it 
has 
been 
reported 
in 
up 
to 
8% 
of 
cases 
[29]. 
Post-tonsillectomy 
bleeding 
continues 
to 
be 
the 
most 
common 
cause 
of 
tonsillectomy 
related 
death. 
Post-operative 
hemorrhage 
is 
generally 
divided 
into 
two 
categories: 
primary, 
which 
occurs 
within 
24 
hours 
of 
surgery, 
and 
delayed, 
which 
usually 
occurs 
7—10 
days 
after 
surgery 
[29]. 
Primary 
post-tonsillectomy 
bleeding 
is 
usually 
related 
to 
insufficient 
hemostasis 
at 
the 
time 
of 
surgery. 
Delayed 
hemorrhage, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
appears 
to 
be 
independent 
of 
surgical 
hemostasis. 
Despite 
advances 
in 
tonsillar 
surgery, 
the 
prevalence 
of 
delayed 
post-tonsillectomy 
bleed 
has 
remained 
unchanged. 
Our 
data 
show 
that 
the 
incidence 
of 
delayed 
hemorrhage 
in 
PIT 
is 
significantly 
lower 
than 
that 
associated 
with 
the 
conventional 
tonsillectomy. 
With 
PIT, 
post-operative 
hemorrhage 
is 
decreased 
because 
the 
resection 
is 
performed 
distal 
to 
the 
arborization 
of 
the 
primary 
vessels, 
exposing 
only 
the 
smaller 
branched 
arterioles 
that 
seem 
to 
be 
less 
prone 
to 
delayed 
hemorrhage. 


Severe 
post-operative 
pain 
often 
results 
in 
decreased 
oral 
intake, 
short-term 
weight 
loss, 
and 
in 
some 
cases 
severe 
dehydration 
requiring 
hospital 
admission 
and 
intravenous 
hydration 
[29]. 
Our 
previous 
reports 
showed 
that 
PIT 
is 
associated 
with 
a 
faster 
and 
easier 
recovery 
[4,5]. 
As 
we 
expected, 
the 
incidence 
of 
hospital 
admission 
for 
dehydration 
after 
tonsillectomy 
was 
reduced 
in 
the 
group 
that 
underwent 
PIT 
compared 
to 
the 
one 
that 
underwent 
conventional 
tonsillectomy, 
presumably 
because 
of 
decreased 
pain 
and 
improved 
oral 
intake. 


The 
current 
study 
has 
the 
limitations 
of 
a 
retrospective 
study, 
which 
limits 
our 
ability 
to 
substantiate 
our 
results. 
There 
are 
several 
factors 
that 
may 
affect 
the 
surgical 
results 
that 
could 
not 
be 
controlled 
for 
in 
the 
study 
due 
to 
its 
retrospective 
nature. 
For 
example, 
the 
selection 
of 
PIT 
versus 
conventional 
tonsillectomy 
was 
not 
random, 
as 
it 
was 
decided 
on 
a 
case-by-case 
basis. 
Also, 
the 
participation 
of 
three 
different 
centers 
with 
somewhat 
different 
follow-up 
protocols 
may 
have 
influenced 
the 
results. 
Indeed, 
only 
a 
prospective 
randomized 
trial 
would 
totally 
eliminate 
the 
intrinsic 
bias 
of 
this 
study. 
Nevertheless, 
considering 
the 
low 
incidence 
of 
regrowth 
and 
the 
decreased 
incidence 
of 
major 
complications, 
together 
with 
the 
previously 
published 
observations, 
we 
can 
conclude 
that 
PIT 
is 
a 
safe 
and 
effective 
technique 
in 
the 
management 
of 
obstructive 
sleep 
disordered 
breathing 
in 
children. 
PIT 
has 
the 
advantages 
of 
decreased 
pain, 
dehydration 
and 
post-operative 
bleeding, 
and 
with 
a 
mean 
follow-up 
of 
1.15 
years, 
a 
low 
incidence 
of 
tonsillar 
regrowth. 
As 
our 
experience 
with 
this 
technique 
increases, 
and 
as 
our 
long 



C.A. 
Solares 
et 
al. 
term 
follow-up 
is 
extended, 
the 
overall 
incidence 
of 
major 
complications 
and 
regrowth 
will 
be 
determined. 
We 
believe 
that 
PIT 
is 
a 
revolution 
in 
tonsil 
surgery 
and 
provides 
a 
higher 
degree 
of 
safety. 
We 
encourage 
other 
surgeons 
to 
expand 
on 
our 
experience 
with 
PIT.
