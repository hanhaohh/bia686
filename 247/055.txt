Aims: 
To 
evaluate 
the 
frequency 
of 
sleep 
problems 
in 
Australian 
children 
aged 
4.5–16.5 
years, 
and 
to 
determine 
whether 
the 
frequency 
of 
sleep 
problems 
on 
questionnaire 
predicts 
the 
reporting 
of 
sleep 
problems 
at 
consultation. 
Methods: 
Parents 
of 
361 
children 
(aged 
4.5–16.5 
years) 
attending 
their 
general 
practitioner 
for 
‘‘sick’’ 
visits 
were 
asked 
to 
assess 
their 
child’s 
sleep 
over 
the 
previous 
six 
months 
using 
the 
Sleep 
Disturbance 
Scale 
for 
Children, 
from 
which 
six 
sleep 
‘‘disorder’’ 
factors 
and 
a 
total 
sleep 
problem 
score 
were 
obtained. 
Results: 
The 
percentage 
of 
children 
with 
a 
total 
sleep 
problem 
score 
indicative 
of 
clinical 
significance 
(T 
score 
.70 
or 
.95th 
centile) 
was 
24.6% 
(89/361). 
Despite 
this 
high 
frequency, 
parents 
only 
addressed 
sleep 
problems 
in 
4.1% 
(13/317) 
of 
cases 
and 
reported 
that 
GPs 
discussed 
sleep 
problems 
in 
7.9% 
(25/ 
317) 
of 
cases. 
Of 
the 
79 
children 
who 
reported 
total 
sleep 
problem 
T 
scores 
in 
the 
clinical 
range, 
only 
13.9% 
(11/79) 
discussed 
sleep 
with 
their 
general 
practitioner 
within 
the 
previous 
12 
months. 
Regression 
analyses 
revealed 
an 
age 
related 
decrease 
in 
problems 
with 
sleep-wake 
transition 
and 
sleep 
related 
obstructive 
breathing; 
sleep 
hyperhydrosis, 
initiating 
and 
maintaining 
sleep, 
and 
excessive 
daytime 
sleepiness 
did 
not 
significantly 
decrease 
with 
age. 
No 
significant 
gender 
differences 
were 
observed. 
Conclusions: 
Results 
suggest 
that 
chronic 
sleep 
problems 
in 
Australian 
children 
are 
significantly 
under-
reported 
by 
parents 
during 
general 
practice 
consultations 
despite 
a 
relatively 
high 
frequency 
across 
all 
age 
groups. 
Given 
the 
impact 
on 
children 
and 
families, 
there 
is 
a 
need 
for 
increased 
awareness 
of 
children’s 
sleep 
problems 
in 
the 
community 
and 
for 
these 
to 
be 
more 
actively 
addressed 
at 
consultation. 


C
C
hildhood 
is 
characterised 
by 
considerable 
changes 
in 
the 
organisation, 
timing, 
and 
structure 
of 
sleep1 
with 
a 
high 
incidence 
of 
transient 
sleep 
problems 
such 
as 
bedtime 
struggles 
and 
sleep 
related 
anxiety.23 
What 
is 
less 
well 
recognised 
is 
that 
chronic 
sleep 
problems 
are 
also 
common, 
affecting 
up 
to 
30% 
of 
children.4–7 
These 
include 
problems 
with 
sleep 
related 
breathing 
(snoring, 
sleep 
apnoea), 
initiating 
and 
maintaining 
sleep 
(sleep 
onset 
insomnia, 
night-time 
awakenings, 
etc), 
parasomnias 
including 
sleep-
wake 
transition 
disorders 
(restless 
legs, 
rhythmic 
movement 
disorders, 
etc) 
and 
arousal 
disorders 
(sleep 
walking, 
night 
terrors, 
etc), 
and 
excessive 
daytime 
sleepiness. 
Chronic 
sleep 
problems 
are 
reported 
to 
have 
negative 
effects 
on 
families 
and 
on 
children’s 
academic, 
neurocognitive, 
and 
behavioural 
performance.8–12 
However, 
despite 
the 
relatively 
high 
prevalence 
rates 
and 
the 
potential 
for 
daytime 
sequelae, 
chronic 
sleep 
problems 
in 
children 
are 
reportedly 
under-diagnosed 
at 
the 
primary 
care 
level.13 
14 
A 
contributing 
factor 
may 
be 
the 
lack 
of 
community 
awareness 
of 
the 
negative 
effects 
of 
sleep 
problems 
on 
daytime 
functioning 
in 
children 
and 
hence 
the 
under-reporting 
by 
parents 
at 
medical 
consultation. 


To 
assess 
whether 
sleep 
problems 
are 
under-reported 
at 
general 
practitioner 
consultation, 
we 
undertook 
a 
prospective 
study 
in 
which 
parents 
of 
children 
aged 
4.5–16.5 
years 
attending 
for 
‘‘sick 
visits’’, 
reported 
by 
questionnaire 
the 
frequency 
of 
their 
sleep 
problems 
over 
the 
previous 
six 
months; 
we 
compared 
this 
to 
the 
frequency 
with 
which 
sleep 
problems 
were 
discussed 
with 
general 
practitioners. 
As 
sleep 
problems 
are 
reported 
to 
be 
higher 
in 
younger 
children111 
and 
possibly 
males,715 
we 
also 
investigated 
the 
effects 
of 
age 
and 
gender 
on 
the 
frequency 
of 
reported 
sleep 
problems. 


METHODS 


Between 
July 
2000 
and 
March 
2001, 
parents 
of 
children 
aged 
4.5–16.5 
years, 
attending 
their 
general 
practitioner 
(GP) 
for 
‘‘sick’’ 
visits 
in 
five 
general 
practices 
in 
the 
northern 
suburbs 
of 
Adelaide, 
completed 
the 
Sleep 
Disturbance 
Scale 
for 


Children 
(SDSC)16 
while 
awaiting 
consultation. 
The 
SDSC 
was 
chosen 
because 
of 
its 
robust 
factor 
structure 
on 
principle 
component 
analyses, 
the 
availability 
of 
standardised 
norms, 
and 
the 
overlap 
of 
the 
normative 
age 
group 
with 
that 
assessed 
in 
the 
present 
study.16 
It 
is 
also 
one 
of 
the 
few 
available 
child 
instruments 
with 
a 
measure 
of 
sleep 
hyperhydrosis, 
which, 
although 
being 
considered 
as 
a 
sleep 
disorder 
in 
children17 
remains 
under-investigated. 
In 
this 
study, 
the 
SDSC 
was 
used 
to 
assess 
sleep 
problems 
in 
children 
of 
a 
broader 
age 
range 
than 
the 
normative 
sample 
(6.5–15.3 
years)—that 
is, 
children 
of 
school 
age 
in 
South 
Australia 
(4.5–16.5 
years). 
The 
SDSC 
contains 
26 
items, 
two 
rated 
on 
a 
five 
point 
intensity 
scale: 
‘‘How 
many 
hours 
sleep 
does 
your 
child 
get 
on 
most 
nights?’’ 
(1 
=9–11 
h, 
2 
=8–9 
h, 
3 
=7–8 
h, 
4 
=5–7 
h, 
and 
5 
= 
,5h); 
and 
‘‘How 
long 
after 
going 
to 
bed 
does 
your 
child 
usually 
fall 
asleep?’’ 
(1 
= 
,15 
min, 
2 
= 
15–30 
min, 
3 
= 
30–45 
min, 
4 
= 
45–60 
min, 
and 
5 
= 
.60 
min); 
and 
the 
remainder 
using 
a 
five 
point 
frequency 
scale 
(1 
= 
never, 
2 
= 
occasionally 
(1–2 
times 
per 
month), 
3 
= 
sometimes 
(1–2 
times 
per 
week), 
4 
= 
often 
(3–5 
times 
per 
week), 
and 
5 
= 
always). 


The 
SDSC 
provides 
six 
sleep 
disturbance 
factors: 
‘‘disorders’’ 
of 
(1) 
sleep 
breathing 
(frequency 
of 
snoring, 
sleep 
apnoea, 
and 
difficulty 
breathing), 
(2) 
initiating 
and 
maintaining 
sleep 
(prolonged 
sleep 
onset, 
night 
awakenings, 
etc), 


(3) 
arousal 
(sleepwalking, 
nightmares, 
and 
sleep 
terrors), 
(4) 
sleep-wake 
transition 
(hypnic 
jerks, 
restless 
legs, 
head 
banging, 
rocking, 
sleep 
talking, 
etc), 
(5) 
excessive 
somnolence 
(morning 
and 
daytime 
sleepiness, 
etc), 
and 
(6) 
sleep 
hyperhydrosis 
(night 
sweating). 
A 
total 
sleep 
problem 
score 
was 
derived 
by 
summing 
all 
sleep 
factor 
scores. 
Standardised 
norms 
were 
used 
to 
calculate 
T 
scores 
(mean 
= 
50, 
SD 
= 
10), 
with 
T 
scores 
greater 
than 
two 
standard 
deviations 
above 
the 
mean 
(T 
score 
.70) 
taken 
as 
clinically 
significant, 
and 
with 
these 
normative 
values 
(that 
is, 
for 
ages 
6.5–15.3 
years16) 
being 
applied 
to 
our 
sample 
of 
children 
4.5–16.5 
years. 
Parents 
were 
instructed 
to 
consider 
their 
child’s 
sleep 
when 
well, 
over 
the 
previous 
six 
months.

To 
examine 
how 
often 
parents 
discussed 
their 
child’s 
sleep 
problems 
at 
consultation, 
parents, 
while 
completing 
the 
SDSC, 
were 
asked 
to 
recall 
if 
they 
had 
sought 
medical 
advice 
(yes 
once, 
yes 
.once, 
and 
no) 
or 
had 
discussed 
sleep 
problems 
(yes, 
no, 
and 
don’t 
know) 
during 
GP 
consultation 
within 
the 
previous 
12 
months. 
Similarly, 
immediately 
after 
the 
consultation 
on 
the 
day 
of 
questionnaire 
completion, 
GPs 
were 
asked 
to 
record 
if 
parents 
had 
raised 
sleep 
problems 
within 
the 
past 
12 
months 
(yes, 
no, 
don’t 
know, 
and 
new 
patient). 
Parents 
and 
GPs 
were 
also 
asked 
to 
specify 
the 
reason 
for 
consultation 
(sleep, 
snoring, 
and 
other). 
For 
this 
study, 
snoring 
and 
sleep 
responses 
were 
combined. 
The 
snoring 
data 
are 
detailed 
in 
another 
study 
whose 
participants 
overlap 
with 
the 
present 
sample.18 


Questionnaires 
were 
distributed 
on 
selected 
days 
over 
an 
eight 
month 
period 
by 
reception 
staff 
according 
to 
their 
availability. 
Completion 
of 
the 
questionnaire, 
which 
included 
a 
brief 
description 
of 
the 
study, 
was 
taken 
as 
informed 
consent 
and 
the 
study 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
Human 
Ethics 
Committee 
of 
the 
University 
of 
South 
Australia. 
The 
northern 
suburbs 
of 
Adelaide 
contain 
a 
high 
proportion 
of 
low 
income 
families.19 


Statistical 
analysis 


To 
examine 
whether 
children 
with 
sleep 
problems 
on 
questionnaire 
were 
more 
likely 
to 
report 
sleep 
problems 
at 
consultation, 
we 
divided 
children 
into 
three 
clinical 
categories 
according 
to 
their 
total 
sleep 
problem 
T 
scores: 
(1) 
normal 
(T 
scores 
,50); 
(2) 
borderline 
(T 
score 
50–70); 
and 


(3) 
clinically 
significant 
(T 
score 
.70, 
that 
is, 
.95th 
centile). 
All 
T 
scores 
were 
based 
on 
normative 
data.16 
To 
assess 
if 
age 
and 
gender 
were 
predictive 
of 
increased 
frequency 
of 
sleep 
problems, 
logistic 
regression 
analyses 
were 
undertaken. 
For 
this 
purpose, 
each 
sleep 
disturbance 
factor 
score 
was 
converted 
to 
a 
binary 
variable: 
T 
scores 
in 
the 
normal 
range 
(that 
is, 
T 
scores 
(70) 
and 
T 
scores 
in 
the 
clinical 
range 
(that 
is, 
T 
scores 
.70). 
These 
binary 
variables 
were 
entered 
as 
dependent 
variables 
and 
age 
and 
gender 
were 
entered 
as 
independent 
variables. 
Pearson 
r 
correlations 
were 
used 
to 
explore 
the 
relation 
between 
SDSC 
factor 
raw 
scores 
with 
significance 
tested 
using 
Fisher’s 
r-z 
transformations. 
Given 
the 
exploratory 
nature 
of 
the 
study, 
no 
corrections 
were 
made 
for 
multiple 
comparisons. 
RESULTS 


A 
response 
rate 
was 
not 
obtained, 
but 
90% 
of 
questionnaires 
distributed 
were 
returned 
and 
based 
on 
GPs’ 
calculations; 
we 
estimated 
that 
26% 
of 
children 
presenting 
for 
consultation 


were 
sampled. 
We 
obtained 
370 
questionnaires 
from 
children 
who 
had 
at 
least 
one 
visit 
in 
the 
previous 
12 
months. 
From 
these, 
we 
omitted 
nine 
with 
two 
or 
more 
missing 
responses 
leaving 
a 
final 
sample 
of 
361, 
consisting 
of 
198 
males 
(54.8%) 
and 
163 
females 
(45.1%) 
(mean 
(SD) 
age 
9.2 
(3.4) 
years, 
with 
48.1% 
in 
the 
4.5–8.5 
year 
age 
range. 
No 
significant 
age 
difference 
was 
found 
between 
gender 
(mean 
(SD) 
age: 
males 


9.1 
(3.4) 
and 
females 
9.4 
(3.4) 
years; 
t 
(359) 
= 
0.88, 
p 
. 
0.05). 
Table 
1 
presents 
the 
percentage 
of 
children 
with 
total 
sleep 
problem 
T 
scores 
in 
the 
clinically 
significant 
range 
(that 
is, 
T 
scores 
.70) 
according 
to 
age. 
Of 
note 
is 
that 
24.6% 
(89) 
of 
the 
complete 
sample 
(n 
= 
361) 
reported 
total 
sleep 
problem 
T 
scores 
in 
the 
clinical 
range. 
Analyses 
were 
also 
undertaken 
on 
a 
subset 
of 
the 
total 
sample 
(n 
= 
248) 
that 
matched 
the 
age 
norms 
reported 
for 
the 
SDSC16 
(that 
is, 
6.5–15.3 
years). 
These 
revealed

23.6% 
(59) 
of

Findings 
revealed 
that

significantly 
predicted

for 
sleep

(SBD), 
arousal 
(AD), 
and 
sleep 
wake

(SWTD) 
problems, 
with 
younger 
children 
reporting 
more 
frequent 
sleep 
problems 
than 
older 
children. 
Other 
SDSC 
sleep 
problems 
scores 
did 
not 
show 
a 
significant 
age

decrease. 
Apart 
from 
a 
non-significant 
trend 
for 
higher 
hyperhydrosis 
scores 
in 
males 
(p 
= 
0.07), 
gender 
was 
not 
predictive 
of 
sleep 
problems. 


Discussion 
of 
sleep 
problems 
on 
the 
day 
of 
questionnaire 
completion 


To 
examine 
how 
many 
parents 
and 
GPs 
reported 
sleep 
problems 
at 
the 
current 
visit, 
questionnaires 
with 
missing 
responses 
were 
eliminated 
(parents 
= 
35, 
GPs 
= 
24, 
both 
missing 
= 
15), 
leaving 
317 
cases. 
In 
this 
group 
we 
found 
that 
4.1% 
(13/317) 
of 
children 
were 
visiting 
their 
general 
practitioner 
for 
sleep 
problems 
(seven 
sleep, 
six 
snoring). 
Of 
these 
13 
children, 
nine 
had 
recorded 
total 
sleep 
problem 
T 
scores 
in 
the 
clinical 
range 
and 
11 
were 
,8.5 
years. 
Similarly, 
GPs 
reported 
that 
3.8% 
(12/317) 
of 
children 
were 
visiting 
for 
sleep 
problems 
(four 
sleep, 
eight 
snoring). 
Of 
these 
12 
children, 
eight 
had 
recorded 
a 
total 
SDSC 
problem 
T 
score 
in 
the 
clinical 
range 
and 
seven 
were 
,8.5 
years.

Discussion 
of 
sleep 
problems 
during 
the 
past 
12 
months 


The 
frequency 
in 
which 
sleep 
problems 
were 
discussed 
by 
parents 
and 
GPs 
within 
the 
past 
12 
months 
is 
also 
summarised 
in 
table 
3. 
When 
asked 
if 
sleep 
had 
been 
discussed 
during 
the 
previous 
12 
months, 
5.7% 
(18) 
and 
3.4% 


(11) 
of 
GPs 
responded 
‘‘don’t 
know’’. 
Overall, 
a 
trend 
was 
observed 
towards 
parents 
and 
GPs 
discussing 
more 
sleep 
problems 
during 
consultation 
in 
children 
who 
reported 
higher 
total 
sleep 
problem 
T 
scores 
on 
questionnaire. 
Despite 
this, 
over 
the 
past 
12 
months, 
sleep 
problems 
were 
only 
reported 
by 
parents 
in 
13.9% 
(11/79) 
of 
children 
with 
total 
sleep 
problem 
T 
scores 
in 
the 
clinical 
range. 


Further 
analyses 
were 
undertaken 
to 
examine 
which 
of 
the 
individual 
sleep 
problems 
might 
contribute 
to 
reporting 
sleep 
problems 
at 
consultation. 
Overall, 
when 
any 
individual 
sleep 
problem 
score 
was 
in 
the 
clinical 
range, 
parents 
and 
GPs 
were 
more 
likely 
to 
discuss 
sleep 
during 
consultation. 
Inspection 
of 
individual 
T 
scores 
revealed 
that 
parents 
of 
children 
with 
sleep 
breathing 
(SBD) 
problem 
scores 
in 
the 
clinical 
range 
were 
most 
likely 
to 
discuss 
sleep 
problems 
(SBD 
= 
14.0 
(7/ 
50)), 
followed 
by

The 
correspondence 
between 
parental 
and 
GP 
recall 
of 
discussing 
sleep 
over 
12 
months 
was 
also 
examined. 
Parents 
recalled 
seeking 
medical 
advice 
for 
sleep 
problems 
in 
4.4% 
(14/317, 
7 
once, 
7 
. 
once) 
of 
cases; 
of 
these, 
11 
children 
had 
total 
sleep 
problem 
T 
scores 
in 
the 
clinical 
range 
and 
nine 
were 
,8.5 
years. 
GPs 
reported 
that 
5.0% 
(16/317) 
of 
parents 
discussed 
sleep 
problems, 
12 
of 
whom 
reported 
a 
total 
sleep 
problem 
T 
score 
in 
the 
clinical 
range 
and 
13 
were 
,8.5

Overall, 
in 
only 
nine 
cases 
did 
both 
parents 
and 
GPs 
recall 
discussing 
sleep 
problems 
during 
a 
consultation 
for 
the 
same 
child 
over 
the 
past 
12 
months. 


In 
summary, 
with 
parents’ 
and 
doctors’ 
responses 
considered 
together, 
sleep 
problems 
in 
symptomatic 
children 
were 
discussed 
in 
less 
than 
approximately 
15% 
of 
cases. 


The

The 
comorbidity 
between 
sleep

was 
explored 
by 
intercorrelating 
SDSC 
raw 
scores. 
Results 
are 
reported 
in 
table 
4. 
Although 
the 
magnitude 
of 
the 
correlations 
was 
low 
to 
moderate, 
all 
SDSC 
raw 
factors 
were 
significantly 
intercorrelated. 
Of 
specific 
note 
is 
that 
sleep 
wake 
transition 
scores 
moderately 
correlated 
with 
all 
other 
sleep 
problems 
scores 
and 
that 
‘‘disorders’’ 
of 
initiating 
and 
maintaining 
sleep 
and 
excessive 
daytime 
sleepiness 
also 
showed 
a 
strong 
relation. 


DISCUSSION 


The 
main 
finding 
of 
this 
study 
was 
that 
chronic 
sleep 
problems 
were 
seldom 
raised 
during 
medical 
consultation. 
Specifically, 
parents 
of 
children 
with 
T 
scores 
in 
the 
clinical 
range 
(n 
= 
79) 
raised 
sleep 
problems 
in 
only 
13.9% 
(11/79) 
of 
cases 
during 
consultations 
in 
the 
past 
12 
months, 
with 
11.4% 
(9/79) 
seeking 
advice 
for 
sleep 
problems 
on 
the 
day 
of 
the 
survey. 
This 
is 
despite 
a 
relatively 
high 
percentage 
of 
reported 
sleep 
disturbance 
on 
questionnaire, 
with 
24.6% 
(89/361) 
of 
children 
reporting 
sleep 
problem 
scores 
in 
the 
clinical 
range. 
We 
also 
found 
that 
sleep 
problems 
were 
persistent 
across 
the 
whole 
4.5–16.5 
year 
age 
range, 
showing 
only 
a 
small 
age 
related 
decrease 
and 
apart 
from 
a 
trend 
for 
sleep 
hyperhydrosis, 
no 
strong 
gender 
differences. 


The 
present 
study 
suggests 
that 
parents 
under-report 
sleep 
problems 
at 
consultation. 
Similar 
findings 
have 
been 
reported 
by 
Stein 
and 
colleagues,20 
who 
found 
that 
although 
10.8% 
of 
4–12 
year 
olds 
(n 
= 
472) 
reported 
persistent 
sleep 
problems 
(Sleep 
Behaviour 
Questionnaire) 
within 
the 
previous 
six 
months, 
less 
than 
50% 
of 
parents 
discussed 
sleep 
at 
consultation. 
Similarly 
Smedje 
and 
colleagues21 
reported 
that 
while 
sleep 
problems 
were 
common 
in 
their 
sample 
of 
1844 
five 
to 
seven 
year 
olds, 
it 
was 
only 
raised 
at 
consultation 
by 
6.7% 
of 
parents. 
Reasons 
for 
under-reporting 
of 
sleep 
problems 
may 
be 
multifactorial. 
While 
it 
is 
possible 
that 


under-reporting 
in 
the 
present 
study 
may 
be 
influenced 
by 
problems 
with 
parental 
recall 
and 
a 
range 
of 
other 
rater 
biases,22 
parental 
recall 
estimates 
were 
similar 
to 
those 
reported 
by 
GPs 
who 
had 
access 
to 
records 
in 
their 
case 
notes 
when 
completing 
their 
responses. 
Furthermore, 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
parental 
under-reporting 
was 
influenced 
by 
their 
limited 
awareness 
of 
the 
importance 
and 
potential 
sequelae 
of 
sleep 
problems 
in 
children, 
such 
as 
reduced 
academic 
performance, 
neurocognitive 
function, 
and 
increased 
problematic 
daytime 
behaviour.4 
8–12 
20 
23 
This 
would 
indicate 
a 
need 
for 
wider 
community 
education 
regarding 
the 
importance 
of 
sleep 
in 
children 
and 
the 
timely 
recognition 
of 
sleep 
problems. 
More 
broadly, 
it 
has 
also 
been 
suggested 
that 
reliance 
on 
the 
biomedical 
model 
for 
history 
taking 
at 
consultation 
may 
also 
inhibit 
and 
thus 
decrease 
parental 
reporting 
of 
sleep 
problems.24 


There 
is 
also 
evidence 
that 
medical 
practitioners 
may 
under-report 
sleep 
problems 
in 
children. 
For 
example, 
Chervin 
and 
colleagues14 
reported 
that 
only 
15% 
of 
symptomatic 
children 
had 
documentation 
of 
sleep 
problems 
in 
case 
notes, 
with 
diagnosis 
recorded 
in 
2% 
(2/86) 
and 
treatment 
not 
recorded 
at 
all. 
Owens13 
reported 
that 
only 
34% 
of 
paediatricians 
(n 
= 
626) 
were 
confident 
in 
evaluating 
sleep 
problems 
in 
children 
and 
adolescents, 
with 
only 
25% 
confident 
to 
treat 
them. 
In 
the 
present 
study, 
parents 
reported 
that 
general 
practitioners 
raised 
sleep 
problems 
in 
only 
10.1% 
(8/79) 
of 
symptomatic 
children. 
It 
may 
be 
the 
case 
that 
sleep 
problems 
are 
discussed 
during 
consultation 
but 
not 
documented, 
or 
alternatively, 
that 
busy 
general 
practitioners 
are 
less 
likely 
to 
discuss 
and 
document 
sleep 
during 
‘‘sick’’ 
visits 
compared 
to 
‘‘well’’ 
visits, 
concentrating 
instead 
on 
the 
problem 
at 
hand. 
Nonetheless, 
taken 
together 
these 
findings 
indicate 
significant 
gaps 
in 
the 
understanding 
of 
sleep 
problems 
in 
clinical 
practice. 
As 
has 
been 
suggested 
by 
Mindell 
and 
colleagues,25 
there 
is 
a 
need 
for 
increased 
instruction 
in 
sleep 
medicine 
despite 
the 
already 
overloaded 
medical 
curriculae. 
This 
is 
particularly 
important 
as 
the 
primary 
care 
physician 
is 
well 
placed 
to 
diagnose 
sleep 
problems 
and 
be 
an 
advocate 
for 
sleep 
education 
in 
the 
community, 


As 
younger 
children 
are 
more 
likely 
to 
experience 
sleep 
disturbance1 
and 
given 
the 
inclusion 
of 
younger 
age 
groups 
compared 
to 
the 
normative 
sample, 
it 
is 
not 
surprising 
that 
the 
frequency 
of 
sleep 
problems 
was 
relatively 
high 
in 
this 
study. 
Nonetheless, 
the 
frequency 
estimates 
for 
the 
six 
sleep 
problems 
observed 
in 
the 
present 
study 
are 
broadly 
comparable 
to 
those 
reported 
in 
community5–7 
11 
15 
and 
general 
practice 
surveys.14

Similarly, 
the 
finding 
of 
an 
age 
related 
decrease 
in 
problems 
with 
sleep-wake 
transition, 
sleep 
breathing, 
and 
arousal 
are 
consistent 
with 
previous 
reports.511

Unlike 
previous 
studies 
however,112 
we 
did 
not 
observe 
an 
age 
related 
decrease 
in 
problems 
with 
initiating

sleep, 
nor 
excessive

to 
find 
an 
age 
related 
decrease 
in 
initiating 
and 
maintaining 
sleep 
remains 
unexplained. 
The 
failure 
to 
find 
an 
age 
related 
decrease 
in 
daytime 
sleepiness 
in 
our 
sample 
may 
have 
been 
influenced 
by 
the 
common 
problem 
of 
later 
sleep 
phase 
timing 
and 
the 
curtailment 
of 
sleep 
in 
the 
morning 
common 
in 
adolescents 
in 
general4 
or 
by 
the 
high 
rate 
of 
comorbid 
sleep 
problems 
in 
our 
older 
children 
(for 
example, 
problems 
with 
initiating 
and 
maintaining 
sleep 
and/or 
sleep-wake 
transition). 
That 
is, 
the 
significant 
inter-correlation 
of 
other 
sleep 
problems 
observed 
in 
this 
study 
may 
also 
have 
contributed 
to 
the 
reports 
of 
excessive 
daytime 
sleepiness 
in 
this 
sample. 
Finally, 
there 
was 
a 
trend 
for 
a 
male 
predominance 
in 
sleep 
hyperhyrosis. 
Comparable 
findings 
have 
been 
reported 
by 
Bruni 
and 
colleagues16 
but 
remain 
unexplained. 


The 
present 
study 
has 
several 
potential 
limitations. 
Estimates 
of 
sleep 
problems 
in 
this 
sample 
may 
have 
been 
affected 
by 
selection 
bias 
as 
not 
all 
families 
attending 
their 
GP 
received 
the 
questionnaires, 
a 
potential 
rater 
bias 
due 
to 
the 
use 
of 
parental 
report 
for 
data 
collection, 
and 
a 
possible 
recall 
bias 
for 
both 
parental 
and 
practitioner 
recall. 
The 
use 
of 
a 
sample 
of 
convenience 
(with 
children 
attending 
their 
GPs 
for 
‘‘sick’’ 
visits) 
may 
have 
reduced 
reporting 
rates 
as 
GPs 
are 
less 
likely 
to 
discuss 
sleep 
during 
‘‘sick’’ 
visits, 
although 
any 
impact 
is 
likely 
to 
have 
been 
small 
given 
that 
our 
prevalence 
estimates 
are 
similar 
to 
previous 
studies. 
There 
are 
also 
inherent 
difficulties 
in 
using 
sleep 
screening 
questionnaires 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
a 
detailed 
clinical 
history 
given 
their 
inadequacy 
as 
diagnostic 
tools. 
For 
example, 
a 
T 
score 
.70 
which 
is 
greater 
than 
the 
95th 
centile 
on 
the 
SDSC 
may 
be 
suggestive 
but 
not 
conclusive 
of 
clinical 
significance. 
The 
frequency 
response 
format 
of 
the 
SDSC 
may 
also 
have 
led 
to 
overestimation 
of 
some 
sleep 
problems 
such 
as 
sleep 
wake 
transition, 
while 
underestimating 
others 
such 
as 
arousal, 
although 
the 
use 
of 
T 
scores 
in 
this 
study 
would 
minimise 
this 
problem. 
We 
believe 
however, 
that 
these 
limitations 
do 
not 
sufficiently 
detract 
from 
the 
findings 
of 
this 
study 
which 
are 
that 
sleep 
problems 
are 
common 
in 
children 
but 
are 
infrequently 
reported 
and 
thereby 
remain 
untreated. 
Furthermore, 
there 
is 
a 
need 
for 
both 
increased 
professional 
and 
community 
awareness 
of 
sleep 
problems 
in 
children.
