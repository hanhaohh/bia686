Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been shown to be an independent 
risk factor for cardiovascular disease in adults. However, there 
are severe limitations in the extent to which the cardiovascular 
consequences of OSA are being studied in children. To investigate 
the echocardiographic changes in children with OSA, right and left 
ventricular (RV, LV) dimensions and LV mass index and geometry 
were measured in 28 children with OSA and 19 children with primary 
snoring (PS). The study showed that LV mass index and relative 
wall thickness were greater in the OSA group compared with 
those with PS (p  0.012 and p &BLDlt; 0.0001, respectively). An 
apnea–hypopnea index of more than 10 per hour was significantly 
associated with RV dimension above the 95th percentile (odds ratios, 
6.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.4–32) and LV mass index 
above the 95th percentile (odds ratios, 11.2; confidence interval, 
1.9–64). Abnormality of LV geometry was present in 15% of children 
with PS compared with 39% of children with OSA. We conclude 
that OSA in children is associated with increased LV mass.

Adult patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) have higher 
morbidity and mortality due to cardiovascular disease compared 
with the general population (1–6). Cardiac dysfunction, 
nocturnal hypertension, and myocardial and cerebral ischemia 
during obstructive apnea have been documented in adults (7– 
10). Several epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that OSA 
in adults is associated with high prevalence of sustained systemic 
hypertension, which is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular 
morbidity (11–13). In pediatric patients, severe OSA 
can lead to congestive heart failure. However, neither the early 
stages of the pathophysiologic changes that link OSA to cardiovascular 
disease nor the long-term impact of milder degrees 
of the disorder on the cardiovascular system are well understood. 
The goal of this study is to evaluate cardiac structure in 
children with OSA. We hypothesized that the intermittent increase 
in systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance that occurs 
with OSA leads to elevation of systemic and pulmonary 
pressures and subsequent remodeling and hypertrophy of the 
left and right ventricles (LV, RV).

METHODS 

Study Design 

Pediatric patients who were referred for evaluation of obstructive 
breathing disorder during sleep underwent a polysomnography followed 
by echocardiography. The evaluation at the time of enrollment 
consisted of a history and physical examination, resting blood pressure, 
and body mass index (BMI). BMI was expressed as a percentage 
of the 50th percentile for age and sex (14). In the history, snoring was 
quantified as less than 1, 1–2, 3–5, or 7 nights/week (15). All subjects 
presented with a history of snoring 7 nights/week. Polysomnography 
results were used to subdivide subjects into those with OSA and those 
with primary snoring (PS). Subjects classified as having PS presented 
with a history of snoring nightly, snored during the polysomnogram, 
and had an obstructive apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) between 0 and 
1 per hour of sleep. Children with an obstructive AHI higher than 1 
per hour of sleep were classified as having OSA. Informed consent 
was obtained from the parents/legal guardian of each child, and assent 
was obtained from children older than 11 years of age. The Institutional 
Review Board of Children’s Hospital Medical Center in Cincinnati, 
Ohio, approved the study. 

Study Group 

Patients aged 2–18 years who were referred to the pediatric Sleep Disorder 
Clinic at Children’s Hospital Medical Center for evaluation for 
obstructive breathing during sleep were recruited sequentially. Children 
with genetic syndromes or congenital or acquired cardiac diseases 
were excluded from the study. 

Polysomnography 

Polysomnography studies were performed overnight according to the 
American Thoracic Society Standards (16) using computerized systems 
(Grass; Telefactor, West Warwick, RI). The following parameters 
were recorded during the study: (1) electroencephalogram, (2) 
right and left electrooculogram, (3) submental and tibial electromyogram, 
(4) electrocardiography, (5) nasal/oral airflow measured by 
thermocouple, (6) end-tidal CO2 tension measured at the nose by infrared 
capnometry and oxygen saturation using the Nelcor N1000 
(Van Nuys, CA) and oximeter pulse waveform, (7) snoring microphone, 
(8) video monitoring using an infrared video camera, (9) chest 
and abdominal wall motion by computer-assisted respiratory inductance 
plethysmograph (Somnostar; Noninvasive Monitoring System 
Inc., Miami Beach, FL). The following parameters were measured. (1) 
Sleep architecture—sleep staging was scored according to published 
standards (17). Arousals were defined as recommended by the American 
Sleep Disorders Association (18). (2) OSA was defined as the 
presence of chest/abdominal wall motion in the absence or decrease 
of airflow and/or the sum channel from the inductive plethysmography 
by more than 80% of the preceding breath. All obstructive 
events greater than or equal to two breaths duration were counted. 

(3) Obstructive hypopnea was defined as reduction in airflow and/or 
the sum channel from the inductive plethysmography between 20 and 
50%, in the presence of chest/abdominal wall motion, associated with 
oxyhemoglobin desaturation 4% or less and/or followed by arousal. 
(4) Apnea index was defined as the number of obstructive apnea per 
hour of sleep. (5) AHI was defined as the number of obstructive apnea 
and obstructive hypopnea per hour of sleep. (6) Oxyhemoglobin 

1396 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE VOL 165 2002 

desaturation index was defined as the number of events per hour of 
sleep where oxygen saturation decreased by 4% or greater. (7) Peak 
end-tidal CO2 tension during sleep was determined. 

Echocardiography 

Echocardiographic examinations were performed using the Sonos 
5,500 Ultrasound Imaging System (Agilent, Andover, MA) and Vivid 5 
(General Electric, Milwaukee, WI). Two-dimensional and two-dimensionally 
directed M-mode echocardiographic images were recorded to 
determine LV mass and relative wall thickness. Echocardiographic 
measurements were made on three or more cardiac cycles according 
to the recommendations of the American Society of Echocardiography 
(19). All measurements were made under standardized resting 
conditions with the subjects in the supine position after a minimum 
rest period of 5 minutes in a quiet, darkened examination room. The 
sonographer was blinded to the results of the polysomnography. The 
correlation for intraobserver and interobserver has been 0.96 and 
0.84, respectively (20). 

Left Ventricular Structure 

The primary measure of LV structure is the LV mass. This was calculated 
from M-mode measurements of the LV end-diastolic dimension, 
the thickness of the interventricular septum, and the thickness of the 
LV posterior wall. End-diastole was defined as the onset of the QRS 
complex. 

LV mass was calculated using the equation described by Devereux 
and colleagues (21). 

LV mass (g)  0.8 (1.04[IVS  PWT  LVED]3  [LVED]3)  
0.06, where LVED is LV end-diastolic dimension, IVS is interventricular 
septum, and PWT is LV posterior wall. Relative wall thickness 
was calculated by RWT  2(PWT)/(LVED), where RWT is relative 
wall thickness, PWT is LV posterior wall, and LVED is LV end-diastolic 
dimension. To minimize the impact of variation of body size on 
heart size, LV mass was divided by the subject’s height raised to the 
power of 2.7 as described by de Simone and colleagues (22) to provide 
LV mass index. 

Left Ventricular Geometry 

The LV geometry was categorized as normal, concentric remodeling, eccentric 
hypertrophy, or concentric hypertrophy on the basis of LV mass 
and relative wall thickness as described by Ganau and colleagues (23). 

Right Ventricular Structure 

The RV end-diastolic dimension was calculated from the M-mode 
echocardiographic images. RV dimension was indexed to height by 
dividing the dimension by the subject’s height. RV dimension was also 
indexed to body surface area by dividing the dimension by the square 
root of the body surface area (19). 

Statistical Analysis 

Demographic and polysomnographic differences between OSA and 
PS subjects were compared using Student’s t test. All results are ex


pressed as mean  SD. All variables except age and blood pressure 
were log-transformed to improve normality, and the log-transformed 
values were used in the analyses. Pearson correlation was performed 
between log-transformed echocardiographic measurements and log-
transformed polysomnographic and demographic variables. Multiple 
regression analysis was performed to identify demographic and polysomnographic 
factors that might predict LV mass index, relative wall 
thickness, and RV dimension. The following independent variables 
were entered in a stepwise regression analysis: age, race, sex, BMI as a 
percentage of 50th percentile for age and sex, AHI, desaturation index, 
maximum end-tidal CO2, arousal index, and systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure. Variables with a p value of 0.05 or less were kept in 
the model. To control for possible effects of age, sex, and BMI on the 
echocardiographic measurements, we forced these three variables in 
the model generated by stepwise regression. Logistic regression analysis 
was performed to determine the odds ratios for having RV dimension 
or LV mass index above the 95th percentile if AHI was 
greater than 10 per hour relative to AHI below 10 per hour while controlling 
for age, sex, and BMI. A value of 38.6 was used as the cutoff 
point for the 95th percentile for LV mass index (24). Published age-
appropriate values for the 95th percentile for RV dimension were 
used in calculating the odds ratios (19). Chi-square analysis was performed 
to examine the differences between groups regarding presence 
or absence of abnormal LV geometry. 

RESULTS 

Study Population 

The total number of study participants was 47 (Table 1). 
There was no difference between the two groups regarding 
age, race, BMI, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Patients 
with OSA were more likely than those with PS to be 
males. 

Polysomnographic Variables and Cardiac Structure 

Of the subjects with OSA, 13 had an AHI of 1.1–10 per hour, 
and 15 had an AHI greater than 10 per hour. Children with 
OSA had a statistically significant increased LV mass index 
and LV relative thickness compared with children with PS. 
There was no difference in the RV dimension adjusted for height 
or for body surface area between the two groups (Table 2). 

Bivariate Correlations 

LV mass index and relative wall thickness of the LV correlated 
with measures of severity of the disorder, namely AHI 
and desaturation index, and with lowest oxygen saturation 
(Table 3). LV mass index correlated negatively with age, suggesting 
a differential effect of OSA on LV mass in younger 
compared with older children. RV dimension adjusted for 
height correlated with AHI, maximum end-tidal CO2, and 
with frequency of arousals from sleep (Table 3).

Multiple Regression Analysis 

LV Parameters. Multiple regression analysis showed that 19% 
of the variability of LV mass index (squared correlation  
0.19) was predicted by a model that only included AHI. (p  
0.0027). When age, sex, and BMI were forced in the model, 
AHI remained the only significant variable (p  0.048). AHI 
and systolic blood pressure predicted 30% of the variability of 
relative wall thickness (p  0.0001) (squared correlation  
0.3). When age, sex, and BMI were forced in the model, AHI 
remained the only significant variable (p  0.0004). The addition 
of age, sex, and BMI to either regression equation increased 
the squared correlation by only 7%, which demonstrates 
that most of the LV mass index and relative wall 
thickness variability is explained by the AHI. 

RV Dimension. RV dimension adjusted for height was predicted 
by arousal index (p  0.01). The model, however, loses 
its statistical significance when age, sex, and BMI are forced in 
the model. 

Logistic Regression 

Out of 47 subjects, 20 had RV dimension above the 95th percentile, 
12 had an LV mass index above the 95th percentile, 
and eight had both RV and LV masses above the 95th percentile. 
After controlling for age, sex, and BMI, subjects with 
AHI more than 10 per hour compared with subjects with AHI 
of less than 10 per hour had an odds ratios of 6.7 for the presence 
of RV dimension above the 95th percentile (confidence 
interval, 1.4–32) or of 11.2 for LV mass index above the 95th 
percentile (confidence interval, 1.9–64). 

The results of logistic regression indicate that patients with 
OSA are more likely to have RV and LV abnormalities than 
patients with PS. 

Left Ventricular Geometry 

A total of 14 subjects (29%) had abnormal geometry of the 

LV. Three subjects had an AHI between 0 and 1 (PS group), 
and 11 subjects had an AHI more than 1 (OSA group). Thirteen 
subjects had LV hypertrophy and one subject had LV re-

modeling. Eleven subjects had eccentric hypertrophy, and two 
had concentric hypertrophy. There was a trend toward increased 
prevalence of abnormal LV geometry with increased 
severity of OSA. Three subjects (15%) in the PS group, two 
subjects (16%) in the group with apnea index less than 10 per 
hour, and nine subjects (60%) in the group with apnea index 
more than 10 per hour had abnormal LV geometry. However, 
this trend did not reach statistical significance due to the small 
sample size. 

Blood Pressure 

Neither resting systolic blood pressure nor diastolic blood 
pressure was a statistically significant predictor for LV mass 
index or RV dimension adjusted for height in patients with 
OSA. This suggests that the effects of OSA on the heart do 
not operate through elevation of daytime blood pressure. There 
was a tendency toward higher blood pressures in the OSA 
group compared with the snoring group. Two out of 19 subjects 
in the PS group had systolic blood pressure above the 
95th percentile, whereas 9 out of 28 subjects in the OSA group 
had systolic blood pressure above the 95th percentile (p  
NS). One patient in the OSA group had diastolic blood pressure 
above the 95th percentile. 

DISCUSSION 

This study has shown for the first time that OSA in children is 
associated with cardiac remodeling and hypertrophy involving 
both RV and LV and that the degree of LV hypertrophy is related 
to the degree of severity of OSA. In contrast, most previous 
studies that have examined the structural changes of the 
heart in children with OSA have focused on the changes in the 
dimension of the RV (25–28). The importance of this observation 
stems from the knowledge that LV hypertrophy is an independent 
risk factor for future cardiovascular disease (29, 30). 

The relationship between LV hypertrophy and adverse cardiovascular 
outcomes has been investigated in the context of 
systemic hypertension. Investigators in the Framingham study 
have demonstrated the relationship between hypertension, 
LV hypertrophy, and the development of congestive heart 
failure. Adults with longstanding hypertension and electrocardiographic 
evidence of LV hypertrophy had a risk of developing 
congestive heart failure 10 times greater than that of those 
without hypertrophy (31). The Framingham study demonstrated 
a significant association between LV mass and cardiovascular 
mortality (32). Koren and colleagues have shown that 
LV mass stratifies risk of morbidity and mortality of adult patients 
with hypertension independently and more strongly 


1398 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE VOL 165 2002 

than do blood pressure and other modifiable risk factors (33). 
The association between OSA and LV hypertrophy in children 
is therefore likely to increase their risks for cardiovascular 
morbidity and mortality at an older age. 

This study has shown that OSA in children is associated 
with an at least 11-fold increase in the risk for LV hypertrophy. 
The mechanism whereby OSA leads to changes in cardiac 
structure remains to be further investigated. Hedner and 
colleagues showed that adult normotensive patients with OSA 
had a higher LV mass index compared with normotensive 
control patients (34). Ventricular hypertrophy may either be 
eccentric, which occurs primarily in response to volume overload, 
or concentric, which occurs primarily in response to 
pressure overload. Among the 12 patients with LV hypertrophy 
in our study, 10 had eccentric hypertrophy, whereas 2 had 
concentric hypertrophy. Finding a majority of patients with 
eccentric hypertrophy among patients with OSA and abnormal 
LV geometry suggests that, at least in the initial phase of 
the disease, sustained pressure overload is probably not the 
main mechanism of LV hypertrophy. 

Several animal studies have examined the relationship between 
chronic episodic hypoxia and LV mass. Studies have 
demonstrated that exposure to chronic episodic hypoxia in a 
rat model was associated with an increase in the ratio of LV 
weight to total body weight compared with control subjects 
(35). The same studies have also demonstrated that animals 
exposed to episodic hypoxia develop persistent elevation of 
mean arterial pressure (36). In an attempt to separate the effect 
of hypertension on LV from the effect of hypoxia, Fletcher 
and associates performed the same experiments on animals 
that had chemical sympathectomy. These studies show that, 
although mean arterial pressure was not different from baseline 
values after a period of episodic hypoxia, the animals still 
showed evidence of LV hypertrophy (35). These observations, 
like those from the present study, suggest that LV hypertrophy 
secondary to episodic hypoxia may develop independent 
of persistent elevation of blood pressure, suggesting that more 
than one mechanism could be implicated in the development 
of LV hypertrophy in patients with OSA. 

The role of humoral factors and cytokines in mediating myocardial 
hypertrophy has also been examined in animal models. 
Animal studies have shown that continuous intravenous infusion 
of norepinephrine induces LV hypertrophy in rats even 
when the LV afterload is maintained within a normal range. 
LV hypertrophy seems to be mediated through a series of cytokines 
such as interleukin 6 and interleukin 1. The use of 
adrenergic receptor blockers prevents the release of these cytokines 
and the development of LV hypertrophy (37). Therefore, 
several mechanisms could contribute to LV hypertrophy in 
patients with OSA besides persistent elevation of systemic 
blood pressure. 

Our study has arrived at a different conclusion from that of 
Niroumand and colleagues (38), which did not detect a relationship 
between OSA in adults and LV mass after adjusting 
for age, sex, and BMI. A possible explanation for the difference 
between the two studies could be due to the different 
methods used to index LV mass to body size. Whereas we indexed 
LV mass to height raised to power 2.7, Niroumand and 
associates indexed LV mass to height. There has been much 
research on determining the best method for standardizing 
LV mass for body size so that comparisons among individuals 
of different sizes can be made. One suggestion has been to use 
height as a method for indexing. Although this method would 
not allow for the effect of obesity on LV mass, de Simone and 
colleagues have suggested that it is more appropriate to use a 
higher power of height because it would be expected that the 

relationship of mass of LV to other measures of body size would 
reflect the geometric relationships between variables with different 
dimensions (22). Height, which is one dimension, would 
be a poor variable with which to standardize LV mass, which 
is three-dimensional. Research into these allometric relationships 
across the age range from childhood to adulthood has 
determined that height raised to the power of 2.7 provides the 
best method for standardizing LV mass for body size. 

There are several limitations to this study. Although a larger 
number of subjects in the OSA group had RV dimension above 
the 95th percentile compared with the PS group and more subjects 
with severe OSA had abnormal LV geometry compared 
with subjects with mild OSA and the PS group, these trends 
did not reach statistical significance. It is likely that the small 
sample size provided limited scope to detect a significant difference 
among these variables. It is also possible that a significant 
difference could have been identified if a group of normal 
children without evidence of obstructive breathing during sleep 
had been used as the control group rather than children with 
PS. This study did not show an association between increase in 
LV mass, altered LV geometry, and elevation of systemic 
blood pressure. Without 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure 
recording, it is not possible to examine the association between 
abnormalities in nocturnal blood pressure, increased 
blood pressure load, and variability and end organ damage in 
the form of LV hypertrophy. 

In summary, this study demonstrates that OSA in children 
causes structural changes involving both RV and LV, independent 
of body weight and blood pressure elevation. These cardiac 
changes are helpful in understanding better the effects of 
OSA on the cardiovascular system over time. The presence of 
LV hypertrophy may also be useful in determining a subset of 
patients for whom more aggressive management of OSA is indicated.
