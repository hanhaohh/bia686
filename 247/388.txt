Objective. To investigate sleeping energy expenditure in paediatric patients with 
obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome. 
Design. Retrospective study. 
Setting. University teaching hospital, Hong Kong. 
Patients and methods. A retrospective analysis comparing sleeping energy 
expenditure in patients with confirmed obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome and 
control subjects matched for age, sex, and ideal weight for body height. Subjects 
were recruited from the Paediatric Chest Clinic and all had undergone overnight 
polysomnography and sleeping energy expenditure measurement by open-circuit 
indirect calorimetry using a metabolic cart and canopy system. The measurements 
were taken during slow-wave sleep. 
Results. Twenty-four cases with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (apnoea 
hypopnoea index >5) and 23 control subjects were studied. Mean age and 
ideal weight for body height were 9.4 (standard deviation, 3.9) years and 152.5% 
(27.2%), respectively. Mean sleeping energy expenditure corrected for body 
weight for the cases and the control group were 44.83 (standard deviation, 
10.49) Kcal/day and 40.71 (10.60) Kcal/day, respectively. Sleeping energy 
expenditure was not found to be associated with the severity of obstructive sleep 
apnoea syndrome (r=0.34, P=0.27). 
Conclusion. A trend towards greater sleeping energy expenditure was found in 
patients with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome. Further studies on the metabolic 
aspects of this condition are required.

Introduction 

Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) in children is characterised by 
recurrent events of partial or complete upper airway obstruction during sleep, 
resulting in disruption of normal ventilation and sleep patterns.1 The condition is 
increasingly being recognised, and studies have reported the prevalence to be 
around 2% to 4% among the paediatric population.2,3 If the condition is

unrecognised and left untreated, poor weight gain may 
result. Early reports quoted a prevalence of failure to thrive 
of 27% to 56%.4,5 Various mechanisms have been proposed 
to explain the poor growth associated with OSAS. These 
include dysphagia or anorexia as a result of adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy,6,7 abnormal nocturnal growth 
hormone secretion,8,9 nocturnal hypoxaemia and respiratory 
acidosis,10 and increased energy expenditure.11,12 However, 
the mechanism remains unclear. 

To further elucidate metabolic aspects of OSAS, a 
retrospective study to assess the sleeping energy expenditure 
(SEE) of paediatric patients with obstructive sleep apnoea 
was planned. It was hypothesised that in patients with OSAS, 
resting energy expenditure is increased secondary to 
increased work associated with breathing during sleep. 

Patients and methods 

Patients 

Twenty-four consecutive paediatric cases with confirmed 
OSAS attending the Prince of Wales Hospital Paediatric 
Chest Clinic were studied. The cases were matched 
according to sex, age, and ideal weight for body height with 
a control group free from OSAS. Those patients with a 
known syndrome, chronic lung disease, neurological or 
craniofacial abnormalities, and those who had had 
previous upper airway surgery were excluded. Children 
studied had undergone physical examination, overnight 
polysomnography (PSG), and SEE assessed by indirect 
calorimetry, after informed consent was obtained from the 
parents. None of the subjects were on medications that would 
interfere with the polysomnographic sleep study or SEE 
assessment. 

Methods 

A complete physical examination was carried out on each 
child to assess physical state, especially growth parameters 
(height and weight), and signs of pulmonary hypertension 
or cor pulmonale. 

An overnight PSG was performed on each child, using a 
16-channel recorder (Oxford Medilog MPA-S; Oxford 
Instruments Ltd, Oxford, UK). In each PSG study, the stage 
of sleep was assessed by electroencephalography, bilateral 
electro-oculography, and submental electromyography. 
Chest wall and abdominal movements were 
measured by respiratory impedence plethysmography; 
and airflow through the nose was measured with a 
thermistor. Oxygen saturation was measured by pulse 
oximetry and body movements were recorded by a body-
position sensor. 

Sleep stage was scored by trained personnel and followed 
standard criteria.13 An obstructive event was defined as 
cessation of airflow, with an increase in irregular respiratory 
and abdominal movement for more than two consecutive 
breaths. Central apnoea was defined as cessation of 

breathing with no respiratory effort for more than 10 
seconds, associated with desaturation, arousal, or heart rate 
changes. Apnoeic episodes with features of both obstructive 
and central events were categorised as mixed apnoea. 
Hypopnoea was defined as a reduction in oronasal flow 
by more than 50%, associated with arousal and/or 
desaturation. The apnoea hypopnoea index (AHI) was 
defined as the total number of episodes of apnoea and 
hypopnoea per hour of sleep. The number of times oxygen 
saturation decreased by more than 4% from baseline per 
hour of sleep was also noted (oxygen desaturation index). 
An AHI cut-off level of greater than five was viewed as 
diagnostic of sleep apnoea. 

Energy expenditure during sleep was measured during 
PSG by indirect calorimetry, using a Deltatrac metabolic 
monitor (Deltatrac II MBM-200; Instrumentarium Corp, 
Helsinki, Finland). During measurements, the subject was 
covered with an airtight transparent plastic canopy. The 
metabolic monitor generated a constant airflow through the 
canopy and back to the monitor of 3 L/minute. All exhaled 
gases were collected in this constant flow. Oxygen consumption 
and carbon dioxide production were calculated 
every minute from the difference in the oxygen and carbon 
dioxide concentration of the inhaled and exhaled gases, 
respectively, after adjustment to standard temperature (0.C) 
and pressure (760 mm Hg or 101.3 kPa) conditions. The 
calculation of SEE was based on the Weir formula.14 Each 
measurement was continued for 30 minutes, and the mean 
value of each variable obtained. All measurements were 
carried out during slow-wave sleep. None of the subjects 
were sedated. 

Statistical analysis 

The values were calculated as a mean ± standard deviation 
(SD) for the cases and controls. Variables were compared 
by the paired t test. The correlation between PSG results and 
SEE was assessed by the Pearson correlation coefficient. 
Analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for 
the Social Sciences (Windows version 10.1; SPSS Inc., 
Chicago, US). The level of significance was set at 5% for all 
comparisons, and all statistical testing was two-sided. 

Results 

Demographic data for the 24 cases and 23 controls are shown 
in Table 1. None of the subjects had features of pulmonary 
hypertension or cor pulmonale on physical examination.

All subjects slept well in the sleep laboratory, with a 
mean sleep efficiency of 84.6%. The measurement of SEE 
did not appear to affect sleep quality. The cases with OSAS 
had a higher AHI than the control group (9.6±18.7 versus 
2.3±1.6; P<0.05). The oxygen desaturation index was also 
significantly higher in the cases than the control subjects 
(9.8±21.4 versus 1.2±1.1; P<0.05). Central and mixed 
apnoea were rare. There were no statistical differences in 
sleep architecture between the two groups. 

Energy expenditure during sleep (corrected for body 
weight) for the cases and the control group were 44.83 
(SD, 10.49) Kcal/day and 40.71 (SD, 10.60) Kcal/day, 
respectively (Table 2). There was no correlation found 
between SEE and the severity of OSAS (r=0.34; P=0.27). 

Discussion 

Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome is caused by a collapse 
of the upper airway during sleep, when muscle tone of the 
upper respiratory tract decreases. It is therefore prone to 
occur in patients with narrowing of the upper airway. 

In the paediatric population, common causes for upper 
airway narrowing are adeno-tonsillar hypertrophy and 
obesity. If OSAS remains untreated, it may lead to a variety 
of complications, one of which is growth failure. Although 
the exact cause of this growth failure is unknown, various 
mechanisms have been proposed. These include anorexia 
or dysphagia as a result of adeno-tonsillar hypertrophy, 
abnormal nocturnal growth hormone secretion, nocturnal 
hypoxaemia, and nocturnal respiratory acidosis.6-10 Marcus 
et al11 demonstrated substantial reduction in SEE in 14 
children with OSAS after adeno-tonsillectomy. This 
decrease in SEE was accompanied by an increase in weight 
gain. Children with OSAS have laboured breathing, using 
their accessory muscles of respiration, and often have 
paradoxical inward rib cage motion during inspiration. Like 
children with other types of respiratory disease, they have 
increased work associated with breathing, and hence 
hypermetabolism. As suggested by Marcus et al,11 this 
might explain the poor weight gain seen in cases of OSAS. 
Stenlof et al12 studied five adult subjects with OSAS 
using a whole body calorimeter, and showed that SEE and 
24-hour energy expenditure were significantly increased 
relative to controls and declined after treatment. However, 
Bland et al15 in a subsequent study measured total energy 
expenditure (TEE) in 11 children with OSAS and found 
no significant difference in TEE between patients and 

controls. Differences in TEE within patients observed 
before and after adeno-tonsillectomy were minor and 
not statistically significant. 

In our series of 24 subjects with 23 controls matched 
for age, sex, and ideal weight for body height, cases had 
greater SEE than controls, but this difference between the 
groups did not reach statistical significance. This may 
suggest that increased energy expenditure during sleep 
could partly account for the poor weight gain seen in some 
paediatric patients with OSAS. However, we did not 
find a positive correlation between severity of sleep 
apnoea and resting energy expenditure. This could be 
explained by the small sample size of the study or may reflect 
the possibility that poor weight gain in paediatric 
patients with OSAS involves an interplay of multiple factors. 
Bar et al16 in their recent study measured changes in the 
insulin growth factor–1 (IGF-1) axis before and after surgery 
in 10 children with OSAS. They showed that there was a 
significant increase in serum IGF-1 levels after surgery, 
which were associated with improvements in nutritional 
status. 

There are certain limitations to the current study that 
should be noted. Firstly, the measurement of SEE was taken 
during slow-wave sleep only. This is a major weakness of 
our study, as childhood sleep apnoea has been shown to be 
most severe during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.1 A 
better reflection of actual SEE could be obtained if data were 
recorded for the total duration of sleep. Due to limited 
resources and manpower, we were not able to monitor SEE 
beyond the first 90 minutes of sleep, and during that 
timeframe a less than representative amount of REM sleep 
was recorded. Secondly, important information could be 
gained by assessing TEE and dietary intake. That would 
again entail much greater resources and personnel than was 
possible in this study. Lastly, there were only 24 cases in 
the study. Though it is the largest number of paediatric cases 
reported to date, a larger study population may be required 
to demonstrate significant differences between cases and 
controls. 

It is likely that growth failure seen in some cases of OSAS 
involves a complex interaction between various pathophysiological 
mechanisms, with increased resting energy 
expenditure only one of several. As OSAS becomes better 
recognised, further investigation of metabolic aspects of this 
condition may be undertaken in studies involving larger 
numbers of patients.
