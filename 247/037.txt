Study Objectives: The upper airway compensatory response to subatmospheric 
pressure loading declines with age. The epidemiology of 
obstructive sleep apnea suggests that sex hormones play a role in modulating 
upper airway function. Sex hormones increase gradually during 
puberty, from minimally detectable to adult levels. We hypothesized 
that the upper airway response to subatmospheric pressure loading 
decreased with increasing pubertal Tanner stage in males but remained 
stable during puberty in females.

Design: Upper airway dynamic function during sleep was measured 
over the course of puberty.

Participants: Normal subjects of Tanner stages 1 to 5.

Measurements: During sleep, maximal inspiratory airflow was measured 
while varying the level of nasal pressure. The slope of the upstream 
pressure-flow relationship (SPF) was measured.

Results: The SPF correlated with age and Tanner stage. However, the 
relationship with Tanner stage became nonsignificant when the correlation 
due to the mutual association with age was removed. Females had 
a lower SPF than males.

Conclusions: In both sexes, the upper airway compensatory response 
to subatmospheric pressure loading decreased with age rather than 
degree of pubertal development. Thus, changes in sex hormones are 
unlikely to be a primary modulator of upper airway function during the 
transition from childhood to adulthood. Although further studies of upper 
airway structural changes during puberty are needed, we speculate 
that the changes in upper airway function with age are due to the 
depressant effect of age on ventilatory drive, leading to a decrease in 
upper airway neuromotor tone.

NORMAL CHILDREN HAVE FEWER OBSTRUCTIVE APNEAS 
DURING SLEEP THEN DO NORMAL ADULTS.1,2 
CONSISTENT WITH THIS CLINICAL FINDING, WE HAVE 
previously shown that normal children are able to maintain near-
constant inspiratory airflow despite the application of increasing 
subatmospheric nasal pressure loads during sleep, i.e., the pediatric 
upper airway appears to dynamically regulate airflow.3-5 This 
compensatory response to upper airway subatmospheric pressure 
loading declines with age.4,5 However, the upper airway response 
to subatmospheric pressure loading has not been studied in detail 
during puberty and adolescence, the transitional period from 
childhood to adulthood.

In children, most community-based studies have shown that 
the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) 
is similar amongst boys and girls,6-9 although this is somewhat 
controversial, as 1 study showed a higher prevalence of obstructive 
apneas in infant boys than girls,10 and some studies 
have shown more snoring in boys than in girls.11,12 In adults, 
the prevalence of OSAS in men is about 3 times that of premenopausal 
women.13 The prevalence of OSAS then increases 
in women after menopause.14 This epidemiology suggests that 
sex hormones play a critical role in upper airway function, with 
male sex hormones associated with increased upper airway collapsibility 
and female sex hormones having a protective effect. 
During puberty, sex hormone levels progress from minimally 
detectable to adult levels, making puberty the ideal natural 
physiologic model with which to determine the role of sex 
hormones on upper airway function during sleep. We therefore 
studied upper airway dynamic function during sleep in males 
and females at different stages of puberty. Our initial hypothesis 
was that the upper airway compensatory response to a subatmospheric 
pressure load declines with increasing pubertal Tanner 
stage in males but remains stable during puberty in females.

For this study, we measured the upper airway pressure-flow 
relationship during sleep, using techniques similar to those previously 
used to evaluate the upper airway in children and adults.3-
5,15-20 This approach is based on the concept that the upper airway 
functions as a simple collapsible tube, as predicted by the Starling 
resistor model.21 According to this model, under conditions 
of flow limitation, maximal inspiratory airflow is determined by 
the pressure changes upstream (nasal) to a collapsible locus of 
the upper airway and is independent of the downstream (hypopharyngeal) 
pressure generated by the diaphragm. The upper airway 
can be represented as a tube with a collapsible segment, the 
resistance of which is 0. The segments upstream and downstream 
from the collapsible segment have fixed diameters and resistances. 
Upstream (nasal) resistance (RN) can be determined by calculating 
the reciprocal of the slope of the pressure-flow curve. In 
this model of the upper airway, inspiratory pressure at the nares 
is atmospheric and downstream pressure is equal to hypopharyngeal/
tracheal pressure. Collapse would occur when the pressure 
surrounding the collapsible segment of the upper airway (criti

cal tissue pressure, Pcrit) becomes greater than the pressure within 
the collapsible segment of the airway. In the normal subject with 
low upstream resistance or subatmospheric Pcrit, who is breathing 
at atmospheric pressure, the downstream pressure never drops 
to Pcrit; thus, airflow is not limited and is largely determined by 
negative tracheal (inspiratory) pressure. However, if the downstream 
pressure falls below Pcrit, inspiratory flow (VImax) reaches a 
maximum (inspiratory airflow limitation) and becomes independent 
of downstream pressure swings. Under these circumstances, 
RN and Pcrit determine maximal inspiratory flow, as described by 
the following equation: VImax = (PN - Pcrit)/RN. The slope of the 
pressure-flow curve (SPF) represents the conductance of the upper 
airway (1/RN). Airflow will become 0 (i.e., the airway will 
occlude) when PN falls below Pcrit. Thus, both Pcrit and SPF can be 
used to characterize the flow response to changes in PN. This is 
analogous to using both the slope and X-intercept of the minute 
ventilation-Pco2 curve in order to characterize the sensitivity of 
the ventilatory response to hypercapnia. Previous studies in children 
have found a very flat SPF. This precludes the determination 
of Pcrit in many subjects, as airway collapse does not occur even at 
maximal subatmospheric PN.3-5 Therefore, pediatric studies have 
used the SPF as the primary outcome parameter.

Methods

Study Group

Normal healthy subjects aged 8 to 18 years were recruited 
from the general community by means of advertisements. Subjects 
with a history of nightly snoring, adenoidectomy and/or 
tonsillectomy, obesity (body mass index > 95th percentile for 
age, race and sex22), or with medical conditions requiring daily 
medications were excluded. The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia 
Institutional Review Board for human studies approved 
the protocol. Informed consent was obtained from 18-year-old 
subjects and the parents or guardians of subjects younger than 
18 and assent from those subjects younger than 18 years.

Study Design

Subjects underwent baseline polysomnography to ensure 
that they did not have a sleep disorder, using standard pediatric 
techniques,23-25 as previously described for our laboratory.15 
Pubertal staging was performed by trained male and female investigators 
using the method of Tanner of genital development 
and pubic hair distribution for boys and breast development for 
girls.26 Tanner stage was corroborated with serum hormone levels, 
which were obtained first thing in the morning following 
the polysomnogram in order to minimize circadian variability. 
Ultrasensitive luteinizing hormone levels were obtained in all 
subjects, follicular stimulating hormone and estradiol in females, 
and testosterone in males. On a separate night, the subject 
underwent repeat monitoring with determination of upper 
airway pressure-flow responses.

Pressure-Flow Measurements

Pressure-flow relationships were measured during a second 
overnight polysomnogram, using previously published 
techniques.4,5,15 Routine polysomnographic measurements were 
obtained. In addition, the subject wore a gel continuous positive 
airway pressure nasal mask (Respironics, Murrysville, PA) 
attached to a heated pneumotachometer (Hans Rudolph, Inc., 
Kansas City, MO) and pressure transducer (Validyne Engineering 
Corp., Northridge, CA). A thermistor measured airflow at 
the mouth in order to assess for mouth breathing. Nasal pressure 
(PN) was measured at the mask, using a differential pressure 
transducer referenced to atmosphere. Signals were acquired on 
a PowerLab system (ADInstruments, Colorado Springs, CO) 
and simultaneously displayed on a Rembrandt polysomnography 
system (Embla, Denver, CO). PN was altered in either a 
positive or subatmospheric direction using a device provided 
by Respironics.4,5,15 A toggle switch allowed the patient to be 
switched rapidly between positive and negative nasal pressure, 
ranging from -25 to +30 cm H2O.

Measurements were performed preferentially during slow 
wave sleep, as subjects are least likely to arouse during this 
stage. If this was not possible due to insufficient amounts of 
slow wave sleep during the night, measurements were performed 
during stage 2 sleep. It has been shown that there is no 
difference in pressure-flow relationships using these techniques 
between stage 2 and slow wave sleep.4 Studies were initiated 
with the subject breathing continuous positive airway pressure 
of 2 cm H2O, which in all cases was sufficient to overcome 
inspiratory airflow limitation. Flow limitation was determined 
by the characteristic waveform pattern, consisting of increasing 
inspiratory flow followed by a midinspiratory plateau,3,5,15,27 
rather than by using invasive esophageal pressure measurements 
in these young volunteers.28 PN was decreased in a stepwise 
fashion by 2-cm H2O decrements every 30 seconds until 
flow approached 0 or the subject aroused from sleep.

Data Analysis

The average midinspiratory flow was measured from the 
lowest 2 consecutive breaths at each level of PN.5,15 Pressure-
flow curves were constructed by plotting maximal inspiratory 
airflow (VImax) of flow-limited breaths against PN. PN versus V. 
curves were fitted by least squares linear regression. The SPF 
was the primary outcome parameter. The critical closing pressure 
(Pcrit) was defined as the X-axis intercept of the regression 
line (VImax = 0). Because many pediatric subjects are able to 
maintain airflow even at markedly subatmospheric pressures, 
the X-intercept cannot always be determined without extreme 
extrapolation.3-5,15 Therefore, as in previous studies, we arbitrarily 
assigned a threshold value of -25 cm H2O (the lowest 
PN deliverable by our equipment) to Pcrit data that were extrapolated 
to less than -25 cm H2O.5,15 This allowed us to apply statistical 
methods to the Pcrit data, although it resulted in a floor 
effect and, hence, an underestimation of differences between 
groups. For this reason, SPF rather than Pcrit was the primary 
outcome measure.

Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated, followed by 
partial correlation coefficients. A partial correlation is the correlation 
that remains between 2 variables after removing the 
correlation that is due to their mutual association with some 
other variable or variables. Differences in groups with Pcrit values 
greater than -25 cm H2O or less than -25 cm H2O were 
determined using Mann-Whitney rank sum tests, as were differences 
in SPF, Pcrit, and height between males and females 
To examine possible sex and age interaction effects, SPF and 
Pcrit data were ranked, and separate analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
models were used on the ranked data. In these “nonparametric” 
ANCOVAs on ranked data, sex was included as the 
factor and age (measured continuously) as a covariate and the 
factor × covariate interaction term was included in the initial 
models. Differences in SPF and Pcrit among the different races, 
as well as differences among adolescents and other age groups 
from previous studies, were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis 
1-way analysis of variance on ranks, and Mann-Whitney tests 
were used for pairwise comparisons.

Results

Study Group

Sixty-nine subjects were recruited. Five subjects did not return 
for the pressure-flow response studies (2 were excluded 
due to an elevated number of periodic limb movements on the 
baseline polysomnogram, 1 was excluded due to very poor 
sleep efficiency at baseline, and 2 declined). A further subject 
was excluded because she was taking oral contraceptives. Thus, 
63 subjects completed the study. Subject characteristics are 
shown in Table 1. The number of subjects of each sex at each 
Tanner stage are shown in Figure 1. Tanner staging was consistent 
with hormone levels in 97% of subjects (the remaining 3% 
were assigned using the clinical Tanner staging). There was no 
significant difference in age (13 + 3 vs 13 + 3 years, P = 0.588), 
Tanner stage (P = 0.405), or height (160 + 18 vs 154 + 11 cm, 
P = 0.215) between males and females.

Pressure-Flow Relationships

Seventy-three percent of runs were performed in slow wave 
sleep; the remainder were in stage 2. The mean PN at which flow 
limitation first occurred was 0 + 2 cm H2O for both males and 
females. Results are shown in Table 2 and Figure 2.

The SPF had a statistically significant linear relationship 
with both age and Tanner stage. However, the correlation between 
SPF and age remained significant even after removing 
the correlation that was due to their mutual association with 
Tanner stage (r = 0.35, P = 0.005), whereas the correlation between 
SPF and Tanner stage became nonsignificant when the 
correlation that was due to their mutual association with age 
was removed (r = -0.13, P = 0.315).

Fifty-six percent of subjects had a Pcrit less than -25 cm H2O; 
i.e., Pcrit was too negative to be extrapolated, indicating that the 
subjects were able to maintain near-constant inspiratory airflow 
despite increasing subatmospheric nasal pressure. When subjects 
were dichotomized as having either a Pcrit greater than -25 
cm H2O or less than or equal to -25 cm H2O, there was a trend 
for subjects with a Pcrit less than -25 cm to be younger (12.6 + 
2.7 vs 13.9 + 2.8 years), but this did not reach statistical significance 
(P = 0.079).

Pcrit had a statistically significant linear relationship with both 
age and Tanner stage (Table 2). However, the partial correlation 
between Pcrit and age became statistically nonsignificant (r = 
0.158, P = 0.219) after removing the correlation that was due to 
their mutual association with Tanner stage. Likewise, the correlation 
between Pcrit and Tanner stage disappeared when the correlation 
due to their mutual association with age was removed 
(r = 0.024, P = 0.851). It should be noted, however, that these 
results were influenced by the floor effect of assigning a Pcrit of 
-25 cm H2O to those subjects with very negative extrapolated 
Pcrit values. To further assess this, analyses were repeated using 
an extrapolated Pcrit threshold of -100 cm H2O (realizing 
that this was nonphysiologic, in that it far exceeded the subatmospheric 
pressure deliverable by the study equipment). Only 
14% of subjects (all less than 14 years of age; two-thirds at 
Tanner stage 1) still exceeded the cutoff Pcrit. Using this cutoff, 
there was a statistically significant linear relationship between 
Pcrit and both age and Tanner stage (r = 0.43, P < 0.0005 for age 
and r = 0.35, P = 0.005 for Tanner stage). However, the correlation 
between Pcrit and age remained even after removing the 
correlation that was due to their mutual association with Tanner 
stage (Spearman partial correlation = 0.274, P = 0.031), whereas 
the correlation between Pcrit and Tanner stage disappeared 
when the correlation that was due to their mutual association 
with age was removed.

Effect of Sex

When males and females were evaluated separately, the partial 
correlations between Tanner stage, age, and pressure-flow 
relationship parameters were not significant, probably because 
of the smaller numbers. However, females had a significantly 
lower SPF than males (Table 3). There were no statistically significant 
differences in Pcrit (using either the -25 cm H2O or the 
-100 cm H2O cutoffs) between the sexes. There were no significant 
correlations between hormone levels and pressure-flow 
response parameters in either males or females.

The ANCOVA for age × sex interaction was not statistically 
significant for either SPF (P = 0.520) or Pcrit (using a cutoff of -25 
cm H2O) (P = 0.927). When the interaction terms were removed 
from these models, there was a statistically significant main effect 
of age on both SPF (P < 0.0005) and Pcrit (P = 0.015), and 
there was a significant main effect of sex on SPF (P = 0.004) but 
not on Pcrit (P = 0.440).

Effect of Other Factors

There were no changes in any of the above relationships 
when SPF was corrected for height. There was no difference in 
SPF or Pcrit among the different races, although it should be noted 
that the number of subjects of each race was low, with 81% 
of the subjects being either African American or Caucasian.

Comparison with Other Age Groups

The SPF data from this study were compared with data on 
infants, school-aged children, and adults, acquired by the investigators 
in previous studies using identical methods.5 Tanner 1 
subjects were grouped with the school-aged children from the 
previous study, Tanner 2 to 4 subjects were considered adolescents, 
and Tanner 5 subjects were grouped with the adults. 
Box plots of the data are shown in Figure 3. Kruskal-Wallis 



tests indicated a statistically significant difference among the 
age groupings (P < 0.0005). Pairwise tests were conducted with 
Mann-Whitney tests using the Bonferroni correction factor 
(0.05/6), which would require a P value of less than 0.0083. 
Results indicated that adults had a significantly greater SPF 
than any of the pediatric age groups (P < 0.0005, P < 0.0005, 
and P = 0.001, respectively, for infants, children, and adolescents). 
Adolescents had a greater SPF compared with infants (P 
< 0.0005), but the difference between adolescents and children 
did not reach statistical significance based on the Bonferroni 
correction factor (P = 0.009). The difference between infants 
and children did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.142).

Discussion

This study has shown that age, rather than Tanner stage, is 
the prime determinant of the upper airway response to subatmospheric 
pressure loads during sleep. The finding of a flatter SPF 
in younger children indicates that the subjects are able to maintain 
near constant inspiratory airflow despite increasingly subatmospheric 
nasal pressure, i.e., that their upper airway appeared to 
dynamically regulate airflow. Males in the pubertal years have 
less of a response to subatmospheric pressure loading than do 
females.

Causes of Changes in Upper Airway Function During 
Development

Children snore less than do adults and have fewer obstructive 
apneas during sleep.1 Consistent with this clinical finding, 
the upper airway in normal children is very resistant to collapse 
during sleep, compared with that of adults.4 Theoretically, 
puberty would be a logical time for the transition from the pediatric 
to the adult pattern of upper airway collapsibility. This 
transition could be due to a number of factors: hormone-related 
changes, growth-related changes, or other changes related to 
neural development, such as changes in the ventilatory drive.

Effects of Sex Hormones on Upper Airway Function During 
Sleep

Sex hormones influence the ventilatory drive, apneic threshold, 
upper airway structure, and upper airway collapsibility.29-
35 In prepubertal children, most studies indicate that OSAS 
occurs equally among boys and girls.6 To the best of our 
knowledge, there have been no population-based studies evaluating 
the relationship between the prevalence of OSAS and 
sex in adolescents. The flatter SPF noted in adolescent girls in 
this study suggests that sex-related differences in upper airway 
function during sleep may begin during adolescence. In 
adults, OSAS is 3 times as common in men as in women.13 
The prevalence of OSAS then increases in women after menopause.
14 The administration of exogenous testosterone results 
in OSAS33 and increased upper airway closing pressures.34 
In 1 study, childhood OSAS recurred in a small number of 
males during adolescence, but not in females.36 These facts 
all suggest that testosterone promotes upper airway collapse, 
whereas female sex hormones are protective. Nevertheless, 
attempts to treat OSAS with female sex hormones have been 
disappointing.37,38 One problem with previous studies is that 
hormone levels were manipulated by administering exogenous 
hormones. Sex hormones and gonadotrophins are secreted in 
a pulsatile fashion, and secretion is modulated by circadian 
and monthly cycles.39 Thus, exogenous administration is quite 
different from the physiologic condition and results in nonphysiologically 
fluctuating levels that may be subphysiologic 
or supraphysiologic.32 In contrast, puberty provides a natural 
intervention. During pubertal development, hormone levels 
increase from minimally detectable to adult levels.

The results of the current study indicate that direct effects of 
sex hormones, such as their effect on ventilatory drive or on the

respectively, for infants, children, and adolescents). Adolescents 
had a greater SPF compared with infants (P < 0.0005) but not 
compared with children.

nasal mucosa,40 are unlikely to be a primary cause of increased 
upper airway collapsibility. However, this study does not rule 
out the possibility that the effect of sex hormones on structural 
factors over many years may affect upper airway collapsibility. 
In addition to changes in size, the upper airway shape and composition 
change during puberty in males.41 For example, 1 study 
demonstrated that pubertal and postpubertal males have larger 
tongues than females, although the study was not controlled for 
overall body size.42

Effects of growth on upper airway function during sleep

It is possible that the changes in upper airway function demonstrated 
in this study were due to structural changes in the 
upper airway, such as changes in airway size, composition, or 
stiffness. The upper airway widens with growth,43 and a wider 
airway results in less collapse and less obstructive apnea.44 
Thus, the changes in upper airway caliber with growth would 
be predicted to result in increased flow in response to subatmospheric 
pressure, rather than the decreased flow demonstrated 
in this study. Another possibility is that upper airway dynamics 
during sleep are related to tracheal length. Tracheal length is 
related to height,43 and a longer tracheal length results in a more 
collapsible upper airway.45 We consider this to be an unlikely 
explanation for our study results. Although upper airway length 
increases progressively from ages 1 to 11 years,46 with a greater 
tracheal growth velocity during early childhood than during 
puberty,47 upper airway collapsibility is the same in infants as 
in school-aged children.15 In addition, although females in the 
current study had a greater SPF than males, there was no significant 
difference in height between the sexes. Data are lacking 
in regard to changes in upper airway composition or stiffness 
during the adolescent years.

It is also possible that the changes in the SPF were simply a 
reflection of height-related changes in pulmonary function, as 
height is a predictor of lung volume. This is unlikely because 
the relationship between SPF and age remained significant 
when SPF was corrected for height. In addition, previous data 
have shown that infants and school-aged children have a similar 
SPF, despite a large difference in height.5

Effects of Changes in Ventilatory Control on Upper Airway 
Function During Sleep

The drive to the upper airway muscles is affected by the 
overall central nervous system ventilatory drive.48-50 Previously, 
it has been shown that the occlusion pressure in 100 
milliseconds (P0.1) during sleep correlates with the SPF, indicating 
that ventilatory drive affects upper airway collapsibility.
4 Children are known to have a higher ventilatory drive than 
adults51-53; the ventilatory drive decreases during adolescence 
to adult levels.53 Previous studies have shown that school-
aged children have active upper airway reflexes in response to 
subatmospheric pressure and that these reflexes help maintain 
airway patency during sleep.5 In contrast, upper airway reflexes 
during sleep are blunted in adults.5leading to a decrease in upper airway neuromotor tone during 
sleep.

Effect of Sex on Upper Airway Function During Sleep

In this study, females had a flatter SPF than males. Females 
do have some subtle differences in ventilatory control compared 
with males (such as a lower co2 threshold),31,54 which may 
account for this difference. Previous studies of upper airway collapsibility 
during sleep in adults have probably included too few 
females to allow for comparison between the sexes, although 1 
study noted increased collapsibility in adult men during wakefulness.
55

In this study, we used pubertal development (i.e., Tanner 
stage) as a marker of exposure to physiologic amounts of sex 
hormones to assess the effects of sex hormones on upper airway 
collapsibility. The serum sex hormone levels were obtained only 
to corroborate Tanner stage. Because sex hormone levels fluctuate 
with both a circadian (males and females) and monthly 
(females) rhythm, a single level is not indicative of baseline status. 
Furthermore, there is a wide range of normal values. Thus, 
it was expected that the sex hormone levels would not correlate 
with the pressure-flow response parameters.

Study Limitations

A limitation of this study was the cross-sectional rather than 
longitudinal design, and future studies evaluating a large sample 
of children longitudinally throughout puberty are desirable. 
Another limitation is the fact that studies in females were not 
performed at a set point of the menstrual cycle. Menstruation 
typically does not begin until Tanner stage 3, and, once menstrual 
cycles begin, they are often very irregular in pubertal 
girls. Thus, it was not practical to schedule subjects at a particular 
phase of the menstrual cycle.

Summary

In summary, this study has shown that upper airway compensatory 
responses to subatmospheric pressure loading during 
sleep increase in a continuous fashion from the prepubertal to 
adult years, irrespective of hormonal status. We speculate that 
this is due to age-related changes in the ventilatory drive, although 
studies evaluating changes in upper airway structure 
during adolescence are needed.
