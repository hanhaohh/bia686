Summary. 
Our objective was to investigate the prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) 
and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in 3–11-year-old Turkish children. A cross-
sectional study was conducted in Zonguldak, northwestern Turkey. Symptomatic children were 
identified by using a self-administered questionnaire and were classified into three groups: 
nonsnorers, occasional snorers, and habitual snorers. All habitual snoring children were invited to 
undergo polysomnography (PSG). Nine hundred fifty-four children (79.5%) were nonsnorers, 205 
(17.2%) were occasional snorers, and 39 (3.3%) were habitual snorers. There was no significant 
relationship between gender and habitual snoring (male, 3.4%; female, 3.1%; P 
> 
0.05; odds ratio 
(OR), 1.13; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.59–2.14). There was a statistically significant relationship 
between habitual snoring and allergic rhinitis (OR, 4.23; 95% CI, 2.14–8.35). Four children 
who snored every night, and who had apnea spells and/or troubled sleep, underwent adenoidectomy 
and/or tonsillectomy before polysomnographic evaluation because of clinical detoriation. 
Twenty-eight of 39 children with habitual snoringparticipated in PSG evaluation.PSGrevealed that 
11 children (0.9% of the total population) had OSAS. When 4 operated children were added to 
these 28 children, we found the minimum prevalence of OSAS to be 1.3% in our studygroup. There 
was a significant correlation between OSAS and troubled sleeping (P 
< 
0.001; OR, 4.37; 95% CI, 
1.33–14.3). We found the prevalence of habitual snoring to be 3.3% in Turkish children by using 
self-administered questionnaires. Allergic rhinitiswas significantlycorrelated with habitual snoring. 
Minimum estimated prevalence of OSAS was found to be 1.3%. Pediatr

MATERIALS 
AND 
METHODS 


Study 
Sample 


The province of Zonguldak, which is situated in 
northwestern Turkey, has a population of 104,500. In 
total, 9,246 schoolchildren are 3–11 years old in this 
province, making up 8.8% of the total population 
(672 children in nursery schools and 8,574 in primary 
schools). A cross-sectional study was carried out in order 
to find out the OSAS prevalence. 

We calculated that 695 children must be entered into 
the study in order to ensure an estimate of OSAS 
prevalence of 2 (previous estimates of OSAS range from 
0.69–2.9%),3,6–11 with a precision of 1% and a confidence 
level of 95%. Selection of subjects was based on the 
school, classroom, and age data of the province, which 
were obtained from the Ministry of Education. The 
student population was stratified by schools and by year of 
course; in each stratum, classes were randomly selected 
and students in each class were enrolled. The number of 
classes selected in each stratum was proportional to the 
size of the stratum. 

The study was carried out in two steps. First, 
symptomatic children were identified by using a self-
administered questionnaire, and were classified into 
three groups: nonsnorers, occasional snorers, and habitual 
snorers, according to parents’ answers. Second, all habitually 
snoring children were invited to undergo polysomnography 
in the sleep laboratory of our hospital. An 
OSAS diagnosis was made when the apnea-hypopnea 
index of the child was greater than 3, in accordance with 
previous studies.3,8 

Parental 
Questionnaire 


The study questionnaire was previously described in a 
report on OSAS prevalence in children.3 The survey 
questionnaire included 31 questions which were arranged 
either as yes-no or multiple-choice questions. In order 
to facilitate parents’ understanding of the questions, a 
document which explained OSAS and associated symptoms 
(including snoring and witnessed apnea spells) was 
added to the survey questionnaire. Survey questionnaires 
were distributed to children by classroom teachers, and 
were then filled out at home by parents. 

The questions were about sleep patterns, sleep problems, 
and sociodemographic data (age, gender, class, 
smoking status in the family and during pregnancy, school 
performance, and behavioral disturbances). Questions 
about sleep-related problems included: ‘‘Do you see your 
child cease breathing during sleep? Do you see that your 

child has difficulty breathing during sleep? Do you get 
anxious about the way your child breathes during sleep?’’ 
Medications previously given to the child, chronic illnesses 
diagnosed by a physician (e.g., asthma, epilepsy), 
and the presence of symptoms that could be related to 
breathing disorders (troubled sleep, enuresis, nocturnal 
sweating, oral breathing, or daily sleepiness) were questioned. 
Allergic rhinitis was defined according to the 
response to the following questions: ‘‘Does your child 
suffer from a) intermittent nasal obstruction, b) nasal 
discharge, c) repetitive sneezing, or d) nasal itching? Has 
your child been previously diagnosed as having allergic 
rhinitis by a physician?’’ A child was classified as having 
allergic rhinitis when there was a previous diagnosis 
and at least two of the aforementioned symptoms were 
present. Anuntaseree et al. used a similar method to 
identify children with allergic rhinitis in Thai school-aged 
children.6 

In the sleep section, questions were intended to score 
the severity of sleep-related symptoms according to a 4point 
scale. A child with a score of 3 (always: equal to or 
more than 3 times a week) was defined as a habitual snorer, 
with 2 (sometimes: twice a week) as an occasional snorer, 
and with 1 (seldom: equal to or less than once a week) or 
0 (never) as a nonsnorer. 

Sleep 
Study 


In the second phase of the study, children with habitual 
snoring were further evaluated by using polysomnography 
(PSG) in order to identify those with OSAS. 

All children were free of upper respiratory infections at 
time of PSG. Twenty-eight children underwent overnight 
PSG (Compumedics E-series, 44 channels) 1 hr before 
their usual bedtime. Sixteen parameters were recorded. Six 
electroencephalographic leads (bilateral frontal, central, 
and occipital), bilateral electro-oculographic leads, and 
submental electromyographic leads were applied. These 
surface leads were used to measure stages of sleep, including 
time spent in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. 
Motion of the chest wall and abdomen were measured by 
respiratory inductance plethysmography. Airflow from 
the nose and mouth was measured with thermocouples. 
Oxyhemoglobin saturation was measured by pulse oximetry. 
Body motion was recorded with pretibial electromyographic 
leads. Cardiac rhythm was monitored with 
standard electrocardiographic leads. 

Obstructive apnea was defined as absent airflow in the 
presence of respiratory effort for at least two respiratory 
cycle times, accompanied by at least a 4% decrease in 
arterial oxygen saturation.3 Hypopnea was defined as a 
50% reduction in airflow with synchronous chest wall and 
abdominal motion for at least two respiratory cycle times, 
resulting in either arousal or oxyhemoglobin desaturation 
of at least 4%.3 The type, number, and duration of 


respiratory events were noted, as well as the median 
and minimum oxyhemoglobin saturation. The apnea/ 
hypopnea index (AHI) was calculated as (number of obstructive 
apnea events plus number of obstructive hypopnea 
events) per hour of sleep time. The cutoff value of 
AHI to diagnose OSAS was selected as >3 in previous 
studies.3,8 We also used this value, and children with an 
apnea/hypopnea index >3 received a diagnosis of OSAS. 

Weight and height data of children who underwent 
polysomnography were recorded. Body mass index (BMI) 
was computed by dividing weight (in kilograms) by height 
squared (in meters). Childhood obesity was defined as a 
BMI at or above the 85th percentile for age and sex.12 

Statistics 


The prevalence of symptoms in the three categories of 
snoring was compared by w 
2 test (or Fisher’s exact test as 
appropriate). The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare 
age data of children with and without OSAS. The 
relationship between presence of symptoms and OSAS 
was investigated by Fisher’s exact test, and the odds 
ratio (OR) was calculated. Univariate and logistic regression 
analysis was used for further analysis on correlation 
of symptoms and OSAS. Mean BMI values of 
children with and without OSAS were compared by using 
an independent-samples t-test. P 
< 
0.05 was considered 
significant. 

Ethical 
Approval 


This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the 
Zonguldak Karaelmas University School of Medicine. 
Written informed consent was taken from parents of 
children who underwent polysomnography. 

RESULTS 


Study questionnaires were distributed to 1,344 children: 
691 (51.4%) were female, and 653 (48.6%) were male. 
Two hundred seventy-eight children (20.7%) were in 
nursery schools, and 1,066 children (79.3%) were in primary 
schools. Of 1,344 questionnaires, 1,215 (90.4%) 
were returned. Seventeen questionnaires were excluded 
from analysis, as they were incomplete. Thus, data from 
1,198 (89.1%) children were gathered for final analysis. 
One hundred ninety-seven (16.4%) children attended 
nursery school, and 1,001 children (83.6%) attended primary 
school. Children were mainly aged 8–10 years. The 
mean (. 
SD) age of children was 8.1 . 
1.9 years (range, 
3–11 years). Six hundred sixteen of the children (51.4%) 
were female, and 582 (48.6%) were male. The female-tomale 
ratio was 1.06:1. 

According to the questionnaires, 39 children (3.3%) 
were classified as habitual snorers, 205 children (17.2%) 
as occasional snorers, and 954 children (79.5%) as 
nonsnorers. There was no significant relationship between

gender and habitual snoring (male, 3.4%; female, 3.1%; 
P 
> 
0.05; OR, 1.13; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.59– 
2.14). Age distribution of habitual snorers according to sex 
is shown in Figure 1. 

Symptoms of witnessed apnea spells, troubled sleep, 
nocturnal sweating, enuresis, and oral breathing were 
significantly more common in habitual snorers and occasional 
snorers compared to nonsnorers (P 
< 
0.001). 
Daytime sleepiness and poor school achievement were 
significantly more common in only occasional snorers 
compared to nonsnorers (P 
< 
0.001 and P 
< 
0.01, respectively; 
Table 1). 

Table 2 shows the association of snoring with predisposing 
factors. There was a significant association 
between snoring and allergic rhinitis, with an OR of 4.23 
(95% CI, 2.14–8.35). Although parental smoking and 
asthma were more common in habitual snorers than non-
snorers, the relationship of snoring with parental smoking, 
smoking in pregnancy, or asthma was not statistically 
significant (P 
> 
0.05). 

Polysomnographic 
Data 


There were 39 children with habitual snoring. Parents 
of 7 children with habitual snoring refused further investigation. 
Four children who snored every night, and 
who had witnessed apnea spells and/or troubled sleep, 
underwent adenoidectomy and/or tonsillectomy before 
polysomnographic evaluation because of clinical detoration. 
Twenty-eight children with habitual snoring underwent 
polysomnographic evaluation in the sleep laboratory

of our hospital. Twenty-eight children (18 male, 10 female; 
mean age . 
SD, 8.2 . 
1.7; age range, 4–12 years) underwent 
PSG. The mean total sleep time was 434 . 
71.5 min. 
AHI was in the range of 0–38.5 per hour of sleep time. 
The lowest oxygen saturation was between 64–94%. 
Oxygen desaturation index was between 0–21. Population 
characteristics and the details of the PSG recordings 
are presented in Table 3. 

OSAS diagnosis was made when the apnea-hypopnea 
index was greater than 3. Polysomnographic evaluation 
revealed that 11 (0.9%) of 28 children with habitual 
snoring had OSAS. When 4 children who underwent 
adenoidectomy and/or tonsillectomy before polysomnographic 
evaluation were added to these 11 children, we 
found the minimum estimated prevalence of OSAS to be 
1.3% in our study group (95% CI, 0.8–1.8). 

There were 15 children with OSAS (M/F, 7/8; mean 
age . 
SD, 8.17 . 
1.69) and 1,176 children without OSAS 
(M/F, 573/603; mean age .

no statistically significant difference between children 
with OSAS and without OSAS regarding gender or 
age (P

0.786, respectively). Among 
15 children with OSAS, age distribution was as follows: 
7 were 6 years old, 5 were 9 years old, 1 was 10 years old, 
and 2 were 11 years old. 

We found that witnessed apnea spells, troubled sleep, 
and oral breathing were significantly more common in 
children with OSAS than without OSAS according to 
univariate analysis (P

syndrome in Turkish children. We found that the prevalence 
of habitual snoring in 3–11-year-old children was 
3.3% in our study sample. There is only a limited number 
of studies about the epidemiology of SDB and OSAS in 
children. In these studies, the reported prevalence of 
habitual snoring in childrenvaried from 3.2–12.1%.3,6–11 
Prevalence rates may change according to study design, 
study population characteristics such as age and sex, and 
the description of habitual snoring. 

Corbo et al.13 investigated the prevalence of habitual 
snoring in 9–15-year-old children. They reported that 
habitual snoring was more common in boys than girls. 
They suggested that the increased levels of testosterone in 
boys after puberty, which has an apnea-promoting effect, 
can increase the prevalence of snoring in boys. Kaditis 
et al.1 similarly found that snoring every night was more 
frequent in males. Other studies did not report such a 
difference in prevalence rates for boys and girls.6,7,9,14 
We found nearly equal prevalence rates of habitual snoring 
for boys and girls. 

Allergic rhinitis leads to nasal obstruction due to nasal 
mucosal edema and mucus secretion. Nasal obstruction, in 
turn, results in upper airway obstruction. More recent 
studies reported a significant correlation between allergic 
rhinitis and snoring.7,10,14 Another study in adolescents 
showed that the primary predictors of snoring were increased 
body weight, presence of factors resulting in decreased 
nasal patency (such as rhinitis, septum deviation, 
and other causes of nasal obstruction), and factors resulting 
in pharyngeal airway narrowing (such as tonsillary 
hypertrophy or adenoidectomy without tonsillectomy).13 
We also found a significant correlation between snoring 
and allergic rhinitis in our study. 

Smoking is claimed to result in obstruction and collapse 
of the pharyngeal airway by provoking pharyngeal 
inflammation and mucosal edema, and thus increases the 
risk of snoring.9,15 It was shown that active smoking is 
a risk factor for habitual snoring in adults.16,17 Similar 
results were reported for young students.18,19 Passive 

parental smoking was reported to be a risk factor for 
snoring in children.1,9,13 Corbo et al.9 reported on a significant 
dose-effect type of correlation between prevalence 
of habitual snoring and number of cigarettes smoked 
by parents. Other studies failed to demonstrate such a 
relationship.6,8 In our study, although parents of children 
with habitual snoring had a higher incidence of smoking, 
the difference was not significant. 

A history of asthma was associated with sleep-
disordered breathing in some studies,20 while others did 
not detect such a relationship.9 Similarly, we found no significant 
correlation between habitual snoring and asthma. 

OSAS prevalence varies from 0.69–2.9% in 
children.3,6–8 In contrast to those for adults, diagnostic 
criteria for OSAS in children are heterogeneous. Additionally, 
differences between studies regarding age and 
techniques used for diagnosis lead to wide variation in the 
reported prevalence rates. Unfortunately, there are no 
age-adjusted normalized data regarding apnea-hypopnea 
indices in children. Several studies used different cutoff 
values of AHI to diagnose OSAS. Ali et al.7 found 
the OSAS prevalence to be 0.7% for 4–5-year-old 
children without using polysomnography. Gislason and 
Benediktsdottir8 and Brunetti et al.3 selected values of 
AHI >3 as the cutoff to diagnose OSAS, and reported a 
prevalence rate of 2.9% in 0.5–6-year-old children and 
1.8% in 3–11-year-old children. Anuntaseree et al.6 
selected a cutoff value >1 and found the prevalence rate 
to be 0.69% in 6–13-year-old children. In this study, we 
used values of AHI >3 as the cutoff to diagnose OSAS. 
Polysomnographic evaluation revealed that 11 (0.9% of 
the total population) of 28 children with habitual snoring 
had OSAS. Four children underwent adenoidectomy 
and/or tonsillectomy before polysomnographic evaluation 
because of clinical detoriation. These children had 
symptoms of snoring every night, witnessed apnea spells, 
and/or troubled sleep, which were reported as risk 
factors in previous studies.3,21,22 When they were added 
to the polysomnographically verified OSAS cases, we 


256 
Sogut 
et 
al. 


found the prevalence of OSAS to be 1.3% in our study 
group. In this study, there was no statistically significant 
difference between children with and without OSAS 
regarding sex, in agreement with previous studies.20,21 

Although in adult obstructive sleep apnea, obesity is 
the single most important predictive factor, we found no 
significant difference regarding BMI between children 
with and without OSAS. This may be due to the small 
sample size, as only 28 children underwent PSG in our 
study. One limitation of our study was that we did not 
perform PSG on the occasionally snoring children. This 
limited the negative predictive value of our study, because 
it is possible that we missed significant sleep apnea in this 
intermittent snoring group, especially if these children 
were obese. Other limitations included the small number 
of sleep studies and the use of habitual snoring as a screening 
tool in selecting children to undergo polysomnography. 
Although snoring is the most common symptom 
of OSAS, the absence of parentally reported snoring does 
not always exclude the possibility of OSAS.1 This may 
have led to underestimation of the prevalence of OSAS in 
our study. 

Some symptoms in children were reported to be risk 
factors for OSAS in recent studies. According to 
Nieminen et al.,22 apneic episodes every night detected 
by parents comprise the most important single risk factor 
for OSAS. In Nieminen et al.,22 the other risk factors 
among night-time symptoms were constant snoring and 
restless sleep. Snoring every night was reported to be 
an important risk factor in identifying OSAS in children 
by Chau et al.21 In the same study, restlessness, daytime 
sleepiness, and enuresis were not found to be related to 
OSAS. Brunetti et al.3 reported that snoring, troubled 
sleep, nocturnal sweating, and oral breathing were positively 
correlated with OSAS. They also reported that passive 
smoking and smoking in pregnancy played a pivotal 
role in augmenting the possibility of developing OSAS. 
We found that troubled sleep was significantly correlated 
with OSAS. We did not detect any significant correlation 
between OSAS and passive smoking or smoking in 
pregnancy. 

In conclusion, we found the prevalence of habitual 
snoring to be 3.3% in Turkish children by using self-
administered questionnaires. Allergic rhinitis was significantly 
correlated with habitual snoring. The minimum 
estimated prevalence of OSAS was found to be 1.3%. 
There was a significant correlation between OSAS and 
troubled sleeping.
