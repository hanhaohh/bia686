Objective: To evaluate the effect of rapid maxillary expansion on children 
with nasal breathing and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. 
Method: Recruitment of children with maxillary contraction, without of 
adenoid hypertrophy, with a body mass index < 24 kg/m2, with obstructive 
sleep apnea syndrome demonstrated by polysomnography, and whose 
parents signed informed consent. Otolaryngologic and orthognathic-odontologic 
evaluation with clinical evaluation, anterior rhinometry and nasal 
fibroscopy, panoramic radiographs, anteroposterior and laterolateral telecephalometry 
were performed at entry and follow-up. 
Intervention: Rapid maxillary expansion (ie, active phase of treatment) 
was performed for 10 to 20 days; maintenance of device (for consolidation) 
and orthodontic treatment on teeth lasted 6 to 12 months. 
Results: 31 children (19 boys), mean age 8.7 years, participated in the 

study. The mean apnea-hypopnea index was 12.2 events per hour. At the 
4-month follow-up, the anterior rhinometry was normal, and all children 
had an apnea-hypopnea index < 1 event per hour. The mean cross-sectional 
expansion of the maxilla was 4.32 ± 0.7 mm. There was a mean 
increase of the pyriform opening of 1.3 ± 0.3 mm. 
Conclusion: Rapid maxillary expansion may be a useful approach in 
dealing with abnormal breathing during sleep.

INTRODUCTION 

THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP 
APNEA SYNDROME (OSAS), MAXILLOFACIAL MALFORMATIONS, 
AND MALOCCLUSIONS HAS ATTRACTED 
ATTENTION.1 Many patients with OSAS show craniofacial 
abnormalities involving both the jaws as well as skeletal structures 
of the respiratory dynamic space.2,3 These aberrations may 
be apparent very early in life. Nasal septal deviation is known to 
reduce airflow and increase resistance to nasal breathing. 
Abnormal nasal resistance can be experimentally induced at birth 
in monkeys.3-5 When these conditions appear in the first year of 
life, they can cause a deformation of the upper jaw, affecting its 
cross-sectional development3,4,6-8 with a resulting reduced jaw 
size in experimental animals and in humans. 

Nasal septal deviation results in the asymmetric distribution of 
intranasal space and affects the turbinates. The latter effect in 
turn causes a reduction of total airflow.3,9-11 The developmental 
impact of abnormal nasal resistance related to septal deviation 
early in life, with or without nasal turbinate hypertrophy, is 
abnormal maxillary development. 

Rapid maxillary expansion (RME) treats upper-jaw constriction.
11-15 We questioned whether RME treatment for children 
could improve (1) nasal airflow by decreasing the abnormal nasal 
resistance and (2) OSAS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Subject Recruitment 

All children were first seen at an orthodontic clinic. The study 
had been planned as a prospective investigation, and any child 
who was new to the clinic and had maxillary constriction, therefore 
being a candidate for RME, was first sent for otolaryngology 
(ENT) and sleep laboratory evaluations. Parents were told 
about the risk of the their children having OSAS with maxillary 
constriction, were provided with literature on the subject if 
requested, and underwent the clinical work-up with their child. 
To be included in the treatment study, the child had to respond to 
the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the parents had to sign 
an informed consent approved by the university’s internal review 
board. 

Inclusion Criteria 

To be considered for treatment, children had to meet the following 
criteria. 

• 
Absence of adenotonsillar hypertrophy 
•

Evaluation The Procedure Used in the Study 


All of the children received (1) clinical ENT evaluations, 
active anterior rhinomanometry, and nasal fibroscopy and (2) 
clinical and radiologic orthodontic evaluations. 

Panoramic dental radiographs and posterior-anterior and lateral 
cephalometric radiographs were obtained at the initial examination 
to assess malocclusion. An intraoral radiographic series 
was also obtained.17-19 Posterior-anterior cephalometric radiographs 
were analyzed using E. Gianni’s recommendations17 and 
Ricketts parameters.18,19 

A validated pediatric sleep questionnaire was used to evaluate 
daytime sleepiness and fatigue.20,21 Polysomnography was 
recorded using 19 channels. Sleep-wake states were based on 
electroencephalogram, electrooculogram, electromyogram, electrocardiogram, 
and body position. Respiration was monitored by 
nasal and oral flow, thoracic and abdominal movements, snoring 
noise and pulse oximetry.22 Polysomnograms were analyzed following 
the Rechtschaffen and Kales international criteria for 
sleep-wake scoring23 and the American Academy of Sleep 
Medicine recommendation for the scoring of breathing events.22 
Abnormal events were considered present if longer than 2 breaths 
in duration. Events were classified as apnea or hypopnea based 
on airflow and as obstructive, mixed, or central, based on thoracoabdominal 
movements and airflow. 

These different evaluations were carried out at entry before any 
orthodontic therapy (T0), after 4 to 6 weeks with the device (T1), 
and 4 months after the end of the orthodontic treatment (T2), 
which lasted 6 to 12 months depending on the child. 

Tool 

RME is an orthodontic procedure that uses a fixed appliance 
with an expansion screw anchored on selected teeth. The central 
expansion screw has a diameter of 1.5 mm and 4 arms for anchoring 
to the teeth. A heavy force (about 1 kg) should be applicable 
to the anchor teeth to act directly on the palatal suture, without 
any undesired tooth movement. This anchoring area thus results 
in a transpalatal force that exceeds the physiologic level that normally 
leads to orthodontic movement. Here, maxillary orthopedic 
movement is obtained by reopening the midpalatal suture. 
Osteoids development occurs at the borders of the palatal process, 
and a normal mineralized suture is built up again at the end 
of the expansion, usually after 3 or 4 months.10,11 

Because the goal is to increase the transversal diameter of the 
hard palate, dental arch tipping must absolutely be avoided.10-12 
The device must not be bulky but, instead, must be strong and 
well fit to the anchorage. The expansion screw must be as high as 
possible toward the palate. The effectiveness of the RME 
depends on the amount of force and on the duration of applica


tion.10,11 

Anchor Teeth 

The anchor teeth are selected according to the phase of development 
of the teeth. Commonly, the first molars and permanent 
premolars are selected as anchor teeth in older children. In deciduous 
teeth, the second molars are selected, provided that they 
offer stability. 

An activation of the device consisted of turning the central 
screw to apply force on the anchor teeth to separate the palatal 
suture. On the morning of Day One, 3 consecutive activations 
were performed at 10-minute intervals, and 3 activations were 
performed in the evening, again at 10-minute intervals. 

From Day 2 onward, the parents performed 1 activation, morning 
and evening. Activation consisted of turning the central screw 
in a predetermined direction. At T0, before any movement, an 
intraoral occlusal radiograph was obtained, and a new one was 
performed 3 days after the beginning of activation (at T0 + 3). 
This intraoral occlusal radiograph verified the movement and 
opening of the midpalatal suture and confirmed the appropriateness 
of the device placement, allowing the safe continuation of 
expansion. 

Duration of the Expansion 

The active expansion ranged from 10 to 20 days in duration 
based on the original narrowness of the maxilla and the predetermined 
individual needs and possibilities. The amount of expansion 
was usually aimed at 1 mm per day. Once the active phase 
was over, a fixed retention phase, with the device kept in place, 
lasted from 6 to 12 months. 

Special Attention 

Important oral hygiene information was given to the child and 
parents. Recommendations concerning the active phase of the 
activation were also provided. 

Statistical Analysis 

Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare before and 
after treatment parameters. The statistical software package SPSS 
version 10 (SPSS, Inc. Chicago, Ill) was used for the analysis. 

RESULTS 

One hundred successively seen children with maxillary constriction 
were first sent to ENT and sleep laboratory evaluations. 
Thirty-one children met the criteria for inclusion: they had no 
adenotonsillar hypertrophy. In 22 children, this was due to prior 
adenotonsillectomy performed earlier in life, usually for recurrent 
tonsillitis or otitis, without investigation of presence or 
absence of OSAS at the time of surgery; in 9 children, no adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy was seen. These 31 children (19 boys) had 
a mean age of 8.68 years (range: 6-12 years). 

The other 69 children were subdivided in 2 groups. Twenty-six 
presented with OSAS and adenotonsillar hypertrophy and, per 
protocol definition, were excluded from the study. Forty-three 
snored intermittently without demonstration of a pathologic 
apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) on polysomnography. All parents 
of the eligible children signed the informed consent. There were 
no dropouts and no exclusions. All children completed the treatment.

AT T0 

Orthodontic Evaluation 

Extraoral Examination 

All of the children presented a flattening of the middle third 
part of the face and were mouth breathers during wakefulness 
and sleep. The 31 children were distributed in the 3 skeletal classes 
that are based on skeletal sagittal relationship (Class I, n = 9; 
class II, n = 14; class III, n = 8). This distribution in all 3 classes 
was expected, as maxillary constriction is an abnormality of the 
transversal diameter. 

Intraoral Examination 

All of the children demonstrated a contraction of the upper jaw 
resulting from a high and narrow palatal arch. It was associated 
with malocclusion characterized by unilateral or bilateral cross-
bite. Cephalometric radiographs confirmed the constriction of the 
upper jaw. 

The ENT evaluation indicated the absence of the adenoids, as 
shown by nasopharyngoscopy and absence of tonsils. Twenty-
two children previously had adenotonsillectomy or tonsillectomy, 
and 9 children had normal appearing. 

Anterior rhinoscopy indicated nasal septal deviation with 
hypertrophy of the inferior nasal turbinates in 23 patients and isolated 
septal deviation in 8 patients. 

Active anterior rhinoscopy indicated pathologic nasal resistance 
> 1.8 Pascal per cubic centimeter of water, with bilateral 
nasal breathing difficulties in 26 patients and unilateral nasal 
obstruction in 5 patients. 

Prick allergy testing was negative for major perennial and seasonal 
allergies for all of the children. 

All of the children reported daytime tiredness and were known 
snorers. Polysomnography demonstrated the presence of obstructive 
breathing during sleep. The mean AHI, defined as the number 
of events per hour of sleep, was 12.2 events per hour, with a 
range of 5.7 to 21.1 events per hour. Three subgroups were created 
based on AHI. Group A consisted of 7 children with an AHI 
> 5 and < 10 events per hour. Group B had 20 children with an

AHI = 10 and < 15 events per hour (mean = 12.4). Group C had 
4 children with an AHI = 15 events per hour (mean = 18.3). All 
apneas and hypopneas were mixed and obstructive. 

AT T1 

ENT Evaluation 

Twenty-one of the 26 children with bilateral resistance and all 
of the children (n = 5) with unilateral resistance at T0 had normal 
nasal resistance at T1 (Wilcoxon z = -4.86, P= .0001). 

Polysomnography 

Twenty-nine of the 31 children had an AHI < 5. The other 2 
children, both in Group C, had an AHI of 6.3 and 8.1 events per 
hour, respectively, from an initial AHI of 19.6 and 21.1 
(Wilcoxon z = -4.0, P= .0001). (see table 1) 

AT T2 

The ENT and polysomnographic evaluations demonstrated further 
improvement with significant difference not only from T0, 
but also from T1. Compared to T1, anterior rhinometry demonstrated 
a further decrease in nasal resistance in all of the children 
(Wilcoxon z = -5.39, P= .0001), with complete absence of any 
pathologic reading (Figures 1 and 2). 

Polysomnography indicated an AHI of less than 1 event per 
hour in all cases (T1 vs T2, Wilcoxon z = -2.0, P= .046). 

The anatomic changes on the upper jaw and nasal septum were 
based mostly on the posterior-anterior cephalometric evaluations 
(Figures 1 and 2). Lateral cephalograms and intraoral occlusal 
radiographs were also obtained to confirm the opening of the 
midpalatal suture. 

The expansion of the maxilla and mandible after RME had a 
mean cross-sectional increase (jL-jR distance)16,17 of 4.32 ± 0.7 
mm. The study of the upper molar distance showed an average 
increase of 3.89 ± 0.3 mm, which associated with poor vestibular 
tipping due to rapid expansion. Consequent to midpalatal opening, 
a hallmark of the procedure, an interincisive space was 
always present, with a mean opening of 2.97 ± 0.2 mm. This 
interincisive opening, always of concern to parents, gradually 
disappeared due to transceptal fiber movement in all cases. 
Orthodontic therapy can speed up this movement but is usually 
unnecessary. 

Finally, RME had an impact on the nasal cavities, with a mean 
increase of the nasal pyriform opening of 1.3 ± 0.3 mm (Figure 
3). None of the children presented any problem with RME. They

tolerated both the activation procedure and the stabilization phase 
well. 

DISCUSSION 

RME is a well-known procedure that has been used by different 
groups for many years in children with orthodontic problems.
10-15,24-26 It is aimed at skeletal expansion of the upper jaw. 
The technique consists of the application of orthopedic force to 
the midpalatal suture. This anatomic area comprises mainly compact 
bone laterally and fibrous tissue with fibroblasts, collagen 
fibers, and blood vessels centrally.9,27-30 RME results in maxillary 
widening by distraction osteogenesis, which was defined more 

Figure 2—Occlusal sequence of treatment with rapid maxillary expan-
sion, from crowding in the upper central incisors (upper left) to a wide 
space (lower image). Note how the palatal vault has changed. 
than 100 years ago by Gavriel Ilizarov31 as “mechanical induction 
of new bone between two bony surfaces that are gradually 
distracted.” Histologic investigation demonstrates that the application 
of strong forces, through an orthodontic device anchored 
to the teeth, rearranges the central zone, with the collagen fibers 
arranging in the direction of the distraction, and a progressive 
ossification occurs. A child can withstand up to 1 mm of expansion 
daily, but the speed of expansion varies. The bone distraction 
at suture level causes an actual widening of the maxilla with 
increasing of the cross-section as well as the volumetric space of 
the nasal cavity. Radiographs of the region clearly indicate that 
RME moves nasal and palatal bones. The total expansion effect 
consists of a downward and forward movement of the maxillary 
complex with a resulting increase in the nasal canal with an 
improvement in nasal airflow. 

Since 1984, Timms13,14,25 has published several articles documenting 
the subjective and then objective improvement of nasal 
resistance in 10- to 20-year-olds using rhinometry.13,25 This 
author even noted an improvement of nocturnal enuresis with 
RME but never made the connection with OSAS. Kural et al24 
also reported improvement of nasal resistance in 10 prospectively 
studied children, 8 to 13 years old, treated with RME. 

RME and associated orthodontic movements can also indirectly 
improve the oropharyngeal space by modifying the resting 
posture of the tongue.3,11,32 

Guilleminault et al,33 in a recent review of 400 children with 
OSAS treated by ENT surgeons, found that about 20% had residual 
problems after undergoing ENT operations. These incidents 
were associated with abnormal craniofacial features and untreated 
nasal resistance. Guilleminault et al34 and more recently 


Figure 3—Posteroanterior cephalograms and cephalometric tracings before and after rapid maxillary expansion. The left image presents the anatomic 
structures before any distraction. As can be seen, the maxillary arch is narrow, the midpalatal suture cannot be seen, and the image of the inferior 
turbinate on the left is very close to the septum (*). On the right of the figure, the results at the end of the distraction can be seen: Note the anatomic 
changes—the skeletal expansion, caused by the maneuver, has opened the maxillary arch. The wide-open distractor (+) can be seen, and the mid-
palatal structure (***) is open. The inferior turbinate (**) on the left side is further apart from the septum compared to before treatment, indicating 
the changes that also occur in the nasal cavity. The drawing in between the 2 radiographs superimposes the 2 images to emphasize the pyriform 
opening and the widening of the nasal cavity with lateral and external displacement of the inferior nasal turbinates. The anatomic change occurs not 
only in the maxillary arch, but also in the nasal cavity. 

SLEEP, Vol. 27, No. 4, 2004 764 Rapid Maxillary Expansion in Children with OSAS—Pirelli et al 


Tasker et al35 have shown that years after adenotonsillectomy 
performed in childhood, sleep-disordered breathing may be 
found and may mark the beginning of OSAS in adulthood. In 
Guilleminault et al’s patients,34 untreated craniofacial problems 
were at the basis of the long-term abnormal breathing during 
sleep. 

As previously shown, RME does not always improve nasal airway 
and nasal resistance. Warren et al,26 who performed a 
prospective study on 16 children aged 10 to 14 years, demonstrated 
improvement in only 45% of cases. One must remember 
that abnormal nasal resistance will have an impact not only on the 
maxilla, but also on the mandible. Despite a change in tongue 
position with RME, the gain may not be sufficient. The width of 
the mandible should be considered when RME is performed, as 
upper and lower teeth must be in apposition. Combined treatment 
on the maxilla and mandible, as recently presented by 
Guilleminault and Li,36 may be necessary. However, RME may 
be a useful approach in dealing with abnormal breathing during 
sleep. It may be very helpful for patients with septal deviation, a 
problem that is often congenital and perhaps genetically determined. 
Septal surgery is not indicated in children, but abnormal 
nasal resistance can lead to maxillary deficiency early in life, and 
both problems may be addressed with RME. 

Finally despite prior work that has been published on RME,1315,25 
this was the first prospective study on children with OSAS. 
We were cautious in our approach and selected only children 
without enlarged adenoids and tonsils. Our results indicate that 
RME is a very valid treatment of OSAS in children without 
enlarged tonsils and adenoids. It was, in our hands, without complication. 
Parents need to supervise their children’s treatment and 
help maintain good dental hygiene during the distraction and as 
long as the distractor is in place. 

We did not enlist children with enlarged adenoids and tonsils in 
this first study, and we cannot indicate if RME should be the first 
treatment approach even in children with adenotonsillar enlargement. 
This first study, however, allowed us to calculate the power 
needed for our on-going second prospective randomized study 
with RME and adenotonsillectomy as the 2 randomly selected 
first treatment approaches.
