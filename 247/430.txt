Introduction 


Sleep-related breathing disorder (SRBD), including 
obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS), is an 
important cause of morbidity in children and adults. 
Childhood OSAS differs significantly from that of adults 
in terms of various parameters such as symptoms, 
pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment and outcome. The 
estimated prevalence of OSAS in children ranges from 
1% to 3% (1–3), and the first scientific case was 
reported only a few decades ago by Guilleminault, in 
1976 (4). Since then, the increased awareness of OSAS 

among paediatricians has resulted in earlier diagnosis of 
patients. The clinical diagnosis of childhood OSAS is 
complicated by the fact that the incidence of habitual 
snoring is reported to be 7–12% (5–7). However, if 
unrecognized and untreated, it may result in significant 
morbidity such as neurobehavioural, growth-related, 
and cardiovascular problems in childhood (5, 8, 9). 
Therefore, an appropriate differential diagnosis is 
necessary to discriminate OSAS in childhood from 
various types of SRBD. 

Systematic studies of sleep architecture have been 
rarely performed in children with OSAS, and little

SLEEP ARCHITECTURE IN CHILDREN WITH OSAS 113 

information is thus available about the influence of 
SRBD on sleep architecture in children. Although 
normal ranges for respiratory indices during sleep in 
children and adolescents have been established (10– 
12), the threshold value of apnoea–hypopnoea index 
(AHI) for diagnosing childhood OSAS has not been 
systematically validated, ranging from 1 to 5 events per 
hour (13–15). 

Cephalometric radiography has been traditionally 
used in clinical orthodontics for the diagnosis and 
management of craniofacial anomalies. Published data 
on cephalometric measurements of patients with OSAS 
have demonstrated a more anterior position of the 
maxilla, a retro-positioned mandible and a bigger 
intermaxillary discrepancy, expressed by the ANB 
angle, compared with control groups (16, 17). 

As it is suggested that children are affected with lower 
levels of AHI compared with adults (13, 15), the AHI 
criteria for the diagnosis of OSAS in adults (threshold 
established as 5), cannot be applicable in children. The 
aim of this study was, thus far, to examine the 
polysomnographic findings in children at different 
levels of AHI (5, 4Æ5, 4, 3Æ5, 3 and 2Æ5), determining a 
cutoff point at which sleep architecture is affected, and 
to investigate the relationship between craniofacial 
variables obtained from lateral cephalograms and 
OSAS. 

Materials 
and 
methods 


Participants 


Participants were recruited via a preliminary questionnaire 
survey for the investigation of SRBD symptoms 
administered to 998 children of two primary schools in 
Hiroshima. The age at the time of the study raged from 
6Æ8to12Æ8 years with a mean age of 9Æ6  1Æ7 
(mean  s.d.). The children were asked to complete 
the questions and provide their contact information if 
they would allow our study personnel to call them for 
screening. Survey data were available from 738 children, 
and the questionnaire return rate was 73Æ9%. 
Among them, 23 children (17 boys and six girls, 
ranging in age from 7 to 13 years) agreed to participate 
in this study, and underwent an overnight polysomnography 
(PSG) study. Before a series of PSG examinations, 
informed consent in a paper form was obtained 
from their parents. Upon entry to the study, the 
participants were evaluated with a clinical examination 

at the orthodontic clinic of Hiroshima University Hospital. 
Body height and weight were also measured and 
lateral cephalograms were taken. All children were 
neurologically normal and had no craniofacial anomalies 
or any other significant diseases. Polysomnographic 
evaluations were performed by a sleep specialist. This 
study was approved by the Ethical Review Board of the 
Hiroshima University Hospital. 

Cephalometric 
analysis 


Lateral cephalograms were taken with the teeth in 
the intercuspal position and the head in a position 
such that the Frankfort horizontal plane was parallel 
to the floor. Each lateral cephalogram was traced on 
acetate paper by one examiner. The tracings were 
computerized by a graphic digitizer (Digitizer 
KD3320*) to obtain the measurements of craniofacial 
morphology. 

Before the measurements, the accuracy of digitization 
was examined by marking three arbitrary points 
on acetate paper and digitizing two times by the 
digitizer to obtain the x 
and y 
coordinates. Differences 
in these data were analysed for the two performances 
using the paired t-test. No significant differences 
(P 
¼ 0Æ66) were exhibited on the x 
and y 
coordinates 
for all the points between the first and second 
procedures, confirming the accuracy. Accuracy of the 
tracings and the digitizing were confirmed by two 
orthodontic professionals joining in this study as 
collaborators. All the investigators were blinded to 
the clinical status of the participants. 

A total of 10 angular and linear variables related to 
both craniofacial skeletal and dental morphology were 
measured. Due to differences in the developmental age 
of the subjects, the z-scores were obtained from each 
subject and used for the analysis of these variables. The 
angular and linear measurement items are shown in 
Table 1. The skeletal patterns (Class I, II and III) were 
determined according to the ANB measurement. Children 
with ANB < 2were classified as skeletal Class III, 
ANB ¼ 2–5as Class I, and ANB > 5as Class II.

induce sleep. Polysomnographic signals were recorded 
into a computerized polysomnographic system (Pollymate 
AP 1000†), using electrodes with three channels 
of electroencephalogram (EEG; C3, C4, O1, 10–20 
international placement system), bilateral electro-oculogram 
(EOG; ROC, LOG) and submental electromyogram 
(EMG). The respiratory polygraphs were 
performed using a portable device (Eden Trace II‡) that 
measures chest wall and abdominal movements with 
an inductance plethysmography, oronasal airflow by 
thermister (Nellcor 974§), oxygen saturation (SaO2)by 
finger oximeter (Nellcor N-25¶), and body motions by a 
body position sensor. Snoring sounds were recorded by 
means of a miniature microphone placed on the skin at 
the level of the larynx. Bedtime and waking time were 
as the child’s usual time, with PSG being terminated 
after final awakening. Sleep stages and architecture 
were visually analysed according to the standard 
criteria outlined by Rechtschaffen and Kales (18) by 
two sleep specialists, which were blinded to the clinical 
status of the participants. 

Apnoeas were divided into central, obstructive and 
mixed. Obstructive apnoea was defined as the cessation 
of oronasal airflow in the presence of respiratory effort 
for at least 10 s. Central apnoea was defined as the 
cessation of oronasal airflow, without movement of the 
chest and abdominal walls for at least 10 s. Mixed 
apnoea was defined as that with both central and 
obstructive components. All three types of apnoeas 
were scored in each participant. Hypopnoea was 
defined as a quantitative decrease of ‡50% in oronasal

flow for at least 10 s with a decrease of ‡3% in SaO2. 
AHI was calculated by dividing the total number of 
apnoeas and hypopnoeas by the hours of sleep. 

The following variables were analysed: total recording 
time (TRT), total sleep time (TST), sleep period time 
(SPT), sleep efficiency (TST per time in bed), sleep 
latency, number of awakenings, number of stage shifts, 
percentages of sleep stages, number of rapid eye 
movement (REM) episodes, total number of apnoeas, 
total number of hypopnoeas, AHI, SaO2 baseline and 
nadir (lowest value during TST), and oxygen desaturation 
index (number of oxygen desaturations per hour). 

Statistical 
analysis 


All data were tested for normal distribution (Kolmogorov–
Smirnov test) and are presented as mean  s.d. 
The variables in the subgroups divided by different AHI 
values were examined by two-tailed, unpaired t-test. 
Pearson’s correlation coefficient was calculated to 
determine the correlation between AHI and the other 
parameters analysed in the study. For the assessment of 
the incidence of skeletal pattern in the subgroups, the 
v 
2 test was used. Statistical significance was set at 
P 
<0Æ05.

significance. The issue of the long-term developmental, cutoff value that shows an effect on sleep architecture, 
behavioural and neurocognitive sequelae has been a which indicates signs of childhood OSAS. We evaluated

between the two subgroups on the

the sleep architecture in children, dividing the group by 
the AHI values of 5, 4Æ5, 4, 3Æ5, 3 and 2Æ5, and found 
that the AHI threshold of 3 was the most likely to 
present differences on the sleep variables between the 
subgroups. 

A little information is available in the literature 
regarding sleep architecture in children with OSAS. In 
our study, when using the AHI threshold of 3, the 
children with higher AHI showed more episodes of 
awakenings during sleep. Consequently, they had an 
increased percentage of TST in wake. However, Frank 
et 
al. (25) reported no significant effect of OSAS in 
children on sleep efficiency, or the number of awakenings. 
Such difference might be due to difference in the 
mean AHI of the subjects. In the study of Frank et 
al. 
(25), all subjects had severe OSAS and the mean AHI 
was >20 before and >3 after surgical treatment, which 
may still be considered a mild OSAS for children. 

Rapid eye movement sleep is thought to be of great 
importance for young children to facilitate growth and 
maturation, due to its significant functional stimulation 
to the central nervous system (26). Our findings 
demonstrated that the percentage of REM sleep was 
less in children with AHI ‡3. The number of REM cycles 
was similar in the two subgroups, and thus the 
decreased REM sleep in the children with AHI ‡3 was 
assumed to be due to shorter episodes of REM sleep. 
This may be related to the fact that REM sleep is the 
sleep stage when respiratory events occur most frequently, 
as was previously reported by Morelli and 
associates (27). Our findings are consistent with previously 
published data on infants with OSAS in terms of 
decreased REM time (28). This is also in agreement 
with studies obtained from adults with OSAS, showing 
decreased slow wave and REM sleep (29, 30). In 
contrast, a previous study about children with OSAS 
reported by Goh et 
al. 
(31), showed that REM sleep 
tended to be preserved. A possible explanation for this 

difference is that there was a premature termination of 
the polysomnographic recording, which could have 
resulted in missing the last portion of a normal sleep 
pattern, including further REM periods. 

Normal values for SaO2 are suggested by Gries and 
Brooks (32), who found a median SaO2 of 96% and a 
nadir SaO2 of 90% in a group ranging in age from 1 to 
20 years old. Some authors support the hypothesis that 
transient desaturation in association with central 
apnoea or periodic breathing is common during childhood 
(11, 33). In this study, 15 children desaturated 
below 90%, of which 13 had an AHI ‡3. Stradling and 
coworkers (34) investigated 31 healthy children and 
none of these had more than three dips in SaO2 >4% 
per hour. When our children was divided at the AHI 
threshold of 3, the subgroup with AHI <3 had lower 
desaturation index and only one participant had four 
dips in SaO2 >4%. Other participants in this subgroup 
had less than three dips. 

Cephalometric analysis has been used to characterize 
skeletal and soft tissue relationships (16, 35). In the 
literature, cephalometric studies have shown the characteristics 
of craniofacial architecture in children with 
OSAS (36). However, correlative data between cephalometric 
parameters and AHI scores are sparse (37). In 
this study of children, according to the ANB angle, 
different skeletal pattern incidence was observed 
between the two subgroups, in which 47% of the 
children with AHI ‡3 were skeletal Class II and 63% of 
the children with AHI <3 was skeletal Class III. In a 
previous study of Hoekema et 
al. (38), a larger ANB 
angle was also found in the OSAS group. In the present 
study, none of the subjects presented severe abnormal 
craniofacial development, and no difference was found 
in the incidence of the mandibular angulations between 
the two subgroups. However, although all children 
presented SNA and SNB angles within normal ranges, 
the group with AHI ‡3 showed a more retrognathic

position of the mandible compared with the group with 
AHI <3, which can explain the difference in the skeletal 
pattern incidence between the subgroups. 

As limitations of this study, experience suggests that 
symptoms in childhood OSAS may vary from night to 
night, and a single-night PSG was performed in our 
study. However, previous reports have proposed that 
the single-night PSG is adequate and cost-effective (23), 
with little night-to-night variability in paediatric PSG. 
Katz et 
al. (39) found that, among 30 children who were 
studied on two separate nights, there was no difference 
between nights in the classification of children as having 
OSAS versus primary snoring. With regard to home 
sleep studies, there may be controversy about their 
efficacy due to limited equipment and, therefore, only a 
few studies have used such type of recordings. We chose 
to use the unattended home recording system that 
makes the child more comfortable in its usual sleep 
environment. If adequately performed by specialists, it is 
possible to obtain valid data. The Tucson Children’s 
Assessment of Sleep collected valuable information 
concerning childhood SRBD using unattended home 
PSG (40, 41). Another limitation which should be 
considered is the small sample size, which provided 
limited scope to detect a significant difference. If more 
children had undergone a sleep study, we may have 
obtained more evidences on our results. Clearly, a larger 
number of subjects is needed for further studies. 

In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that the 
effects on polysomnographic characteristics are the 
greatest on children with higher AHI when AHI 
threshold of 3 was used. Children appear to have 
clinical sequela with milder form of OSAS and, in 
paediatric population, mild OSAS is most commonly 
missed in clinical practice because the symptoms are 
insidious. Our result, therefore, supports the evidence 
that childhood OSAS differs in important aspects from 
adult OSAS and that we cannot underestimate the 
significance of the childhood SRBD. Furthermore, the 
easily performing SaO2 oximetry could provide certain 
information concerning the severity of SRBD and could 
be useful for an initial screening test of OSAS.
