Summary 

Sleep obstructive breathing disorders are frequent in 
children but the impact of sleep deprivation on the cognitive 
learning function is unclear. Aim: To establish whether 
patients with sleep obstructive breathing disorders show 
any functional change in learning, memory and attention. 
Material and Methods: Eighty-one children aged from 6 
to 12 years were divided into 3 groups: obstructive sleep 
apnea syndrome (OSAS), n=24; primary snoring (PS), n=37; 
and control, n=20. The groups were assessed using learning 
(Rey) and psychological (Digit, Code, Letter Concealing, 
and Symbol) tests. Results: OSAS and PS children showed 
statistically significant worse performance on the variable 
A1 in Rey test (learning and memory) when compared 
with controls (p=0.011). PS children had an even worse 
performance on the variables A2, A4, AT and A6 compared to 
OSAS participants and controls (p=0.020;p=0.050;p=0.004,p= 
0.05). Conclusion: Children with obstructive sleep breathing 
disorders, in particular PS, show worse Rey test scores. PS 
and OSAS children performed similarly in attention tests.

INTRODUCTION 


Obstructive sleep disorders (OSDs) are relatively 
frequent in the pediatric population, including primary 
snoring (PS) and the obstructive sleep apnea and hypopnea 
syndrome (OSAHS).1 The clinical picture of PS 
includes noisy breathing with preservation of sleep patterns, 
adequate alveolar ventilation and normal arterial 
oxygen saturation. This entity is frequent in childhood, 
affecting about 7 to 9% of children aged between 1 and 
10 years. Some authors have estimated that the percentage 
of snoring in children may reach 12%, depending on 
age.2-4 There is much controversy about the definition of 
snoring as a benign condition as a result of studies on the 
sleep quality and daytime behavior of these children.5 
OSAHS in childhood is characterized by snoring or noisy 
breathing during sleep, usually associated with hypoxemia, 
hypercapnia, and daytime symptoms such as oral 
breathing, altered behavior and excessive sleepiness. 
Although the incidence of this condition is not defined 
precisely in the literature, evidence suggests that OSAHS 
in childhood affects 1 to 2% of children,6,7 with an equal 
gender distribution.8,9 The medical diagnosis of OSAHS in 
childhood is not simple, as most children snore habitually, 
and the clinical history may not be sufficiently reliable to 
differentiate OSAHS from PS.10 For this reason, assessment 
of breathing during sleep is needed for a clear diagnosis.11 
Since only a few children with PS develop OSAHS, and 
since the clinical history and physical examination usually 
are insufficient to establish the presence and severity of 
OSAHS, polysomnography becomes essential for diagnosis. 
When untreated, this condition may result in inadequate 
growth and poor neuropsychomotor development.6 

Some studies have attempted to establish a relation 
between OSAHS in childhood and behavioral changes, 
learning difficulties, and memory and attention problems. 
Although excessive daytime sleepiness is an important 
complaint in adults with OSAHS,12,13 few parents describe 
their children with OSAHS as drowsy.14,3,10 A major North-
American study found OSAHS in 18% of children that had 
been included among the 10% worse school performer 
group in primary school; in these children significant school 
performance improvements were observed following 
tonsillectomy.15 Other studies in children with OSAHS have 
shown specific learning cognitive and mental processing 
deficits.14,16,17 Results of a major investigation conducted on 
782 children have suggested that there is an association 
between excessive daytime sleepiness and hyperactivity, 
aggressive behavior, and snoring.2,18 Still other studies 
have shown that psychomotor development in children 
is compromised if there is total sleep deprivation, but not 
in partial sleep deprivation.19 

Many studies have attempted to verify the effect 
of sleep on memory and learning, including the effect of 
sleep on material that has been learnt and forgotten before 
and after sleep, the duration of time elapsed before the 
retention test and the type of material that was learnt. 20 

Although there is a growing consensus that the 
prevalence of sleep deprivation in our society has increased, 
the impact of sleep loss on cognitive abilities has 
not been clearly established.21 Furthermore, the cognitive 
consequences of the interruption of sleep patterns and 
hypoxemia as a result of breathing disorders in children 
with OSAHS are still poorly defined in this group.22,23 A 
study with rodents demonstrated that intermittent hypoxemia 
induces a substantial increase in neuron cell loss as 
well as adverse effects on special memory even if sleep 
fragmentation or deprivation is absent. 24 

The aim of our study was to verify if children with 
OSDs presented altered learning, memory and attention. 

SERIES AND METHODS 


This study was conducted in the Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology 
Discipline Outpatient Unit of the Paulista 
Medical School, Sao Paulo Federal University between 
October 2004 and September 2005. The procedures and 
consent terms received prior approval from the Research 
Ethics Committee of the Sao Paulo Federal University 
(protocol number 0912/04). 

The sample included 81 children of both genders, 
mouth breathers, that fulfilled the following inclusion and 
exclusion criteria. 

Inclusion criteria: 

-children aged between 6 and 12 years with obstructive 
sleep disorders according to polysomnographic 
criteria. 
Exclusion criteria: 

-altered neuropsychomotor development; 
-psychiatric and behavioral disorders; 
-syndromes; 
-altered vision; 
-use of medication that acted on the central nervous 
system 
-auditory alterations (history, otoscopy and audiometry). 
The sample group was divided into 2 subgroups, 
as follows: patients with OSAHS and patients with PS. The 
control group included children of similar age in whom 
polysomnography did not detect OSDs. 

OSAHS group: 24 patients, 10 males, 14 females. 
PS group: 37 patients, 22 males, 11 females.

Control group: 20 patients, 09 males, 11 females. 

Children that were included went through clinical 
history-taking and a general physical examination. The 
otorhinolaryngological exam included oroscopy, anterior 
rhinoscopy and otoscopy. All of the children underwent 
nasofibrolaryngoscopy done with a Machida (model ENT 
30 P III, 3.2mm diameter) flexible fiber nasofibrolaryngoscope, 
a xenon light source (Styker, Othobean II), a video 
camera (Toshiba CCD IKM30AK) and a video monitor 
(Sony KV-CR). Other tests included immitance testing, 
and pure tone and voice audiometry (Audiometer Madsen, 
model Midimate 622 and earphone TDH - 39 - ANSI 
standard, 1969). Polysomnography was carried out to 
diagnose OSAHS and PS. Polysomnographies were done 
at the Sao Paulo Hospital Sleep Institute, at night, with 
the patient sleeping in a comfortable bed in a darkened 
and silent room. During the test, electrophysiological and 
cardiorespiratory parameters were recorded on a computer 
system (Alice 3 Healthdyne/respironics, Marrieta, GA) that 
included: an electroencephalogram (C3/A2, C4/A2, O1/A2 
O2/A1), a submentonian and tibial electromyogram, a 
right and left electrooculogram, recordings of oronasal air 
flow, abdominal and thoracic movements, a microphone 
(snoring), recording of oxyhemoglobin saturation (SAO2) 
and the position in the bed in ambient air.

Analysis of results 

Due to the nature of variables, results were summarized 
in tables, number of subjects per group, the mean, 
the standard deviation (SD), minimum, median, maximum 
and the interquartile interval (IQI). 

Comparison between groups was done using the 
Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric analysis of variance; when 
results were significant (*), further analysis was done using 
the Kruskal-Wallis multiple comparisons test.28 

A 5% probability significance level was adopted for 
all the tests to reject the null hypothesis. 

RESULTS 


The OSAHS group (n=24) and the PS group (n=37) 
showed statistically significant differences in variables A1 
(p=0.001), and the PS group showed statistically significant 
differences in variables A2, A4, AT and A6 in the Rey 
Test (p=0.020; p=0.05; p=0.004; p=0.05) compared to the 
control group (n=20) (Table 1). There were no statistically 
significant differences between groups in the attention 
tests (Table 2 to 5).

DISCUSSION 


The negative impact of OSDs on learning, memory 
and attention in children has been frequently mentioned in 
medical literature. There have been, however, few studies 
confirming this association, which makes this theme still a 
highly controversial topic. This paper compared these parameters 
in groups of children with OSAHS, PS and children 
with no OSDs, as diagnosed by polysomnography. 

In our study we chose to use classical and already 
standardized tests. Exclusion criteria sought to eliminate 
clinical conditions that might interfere on our results. 

The learning test (Rey test) involves a sequential and 
identical repetition of the same stimulus. This test evaluates 
learning strategies, the ability to retain a new stimulus 
(immediate memory), the attention tone (attention level), 
preactivation, susceptibility to interference, and memory 
recall when the multiple choice test is done. 

Our results revealed statistically significant differences 
in A1 recall between the OSAHS and PS groups and 
the control group, and statistically significant differences 
in A2 between the PS group and the control group (Rey 
test). These results showed that immediate memory and 
the attention level (that interferes with memory processing)

are compromised in groups of patients that have OSDs. 
Evocation is directly related to the attention level and to 
recall of information presented once, therefore it is also 
related to immediate memory. For this reason when we 
analyzed AT (total number of 5 recalls: A1 to A5), we 
noted a significant difference between the PS group and 
the control group, which was shown in the low A1, A2 
and A4 scores. The worse performance shown by the 
PS group in the five lists, compared to the OSAHS and 
the control groups, suggests that these differences were 
related to information acquisition, storage or recall after 
many repetitions of the lists. We believe that this loss 
may be related not only to intermittent hypoxia, but also 
to the increased number of awakenings during the night 
and the resulting sleep fragmentation and decreased REM 
sleep time, which is necessary for consolidating memories. 
Blunden et al. suggest that this association may be explained 
by a combination of the cumulative effect of chronic 
interruption of the sleep pattern during many years and the 
simultaneous rapid development of the neuronal synaptic 
network in children. If findings of a significant association 
between mild polysomnographic changes in the sleep 
pattern and decreased cognitive performance are shown to 
be real, these findings will point to an important function 
of the sleep pattern in facilitating the development and 
consolidation of memory and learning in children.5 The 
analysis of A6 (recall of list A immediately after reading 
list B) revealed a statistically significant difference between 
the PS group and the control group. This finding assumed 
that list B (interference or distracting list) interfered mainly 
with the ability to maintain the attention level in the PS 
group, which did not happen in the OSAHS group. When 
the learning task was related to the ability to spontaneously 
repeat words that were given previously, we noted that 
after 20 minutes there was no difference between groups in 
word recall and memory (A7). The retention level of verbal 
stimuli after 20 minutes is related to long term memory. 
Based on the abovementioned findings, we concluded 
that there was no loss of recorded information with time, 
suggesting that long term memory was preserved; long 
term memory storage is obtained by a different mechanism 
compared to immediate memory. Our findings confirm 
those of Kaemingk et al., who examined the relation 
between sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and learning, 
which they then compared with learning in children with 
no SDB. Their study involved 149 children aged between 
6 and 12 years that underwent intelligence, learning, 
memory and academic performance assessments. Results 
revealed a significant decrease in learning and memory in 
the SDB group, but no difference in intelligence, attention 
or academic performance.29 

A few authors have reported a decrease in intellectual 
abilities,30 but other have found no relation between 
OSAHS and intelligence in children.17,29,31 Findings on me


mory are also controversial, with some authors reporting 
decreased memory16,29 and others not.17 Lewin et al. noted 
a mild but significant slowness of mental reasoning in a 
small sample of children with untreated OSAHS compared 
with children in which OSAHS was treated and with 
healthy children in the control group.31 

Evidence from studies on the treatment of OSAHS 
offers support to a relation between pediatric OSAHS and 
cognitive function. Tonsillectomy is effective in treating 
breathing problems in most children with OSAHS, and 
appears to help improve academic and intellectual performance 
and behavior.15,30,32 A single study on long term 
results, published by Gozal and Pope, reported poorer 
academic performance in currently non-snoring teenagers 
that were snorers in childhood compared to teenagers that 
were not snorers when younger.24 

We believe, as Beebe and Gozal33 do, that the mechanism 
by which OSAHS promotes cognitive morbidity 
and altered learning in childhood remains unclear. Two 
potential contributors have received increased attention, 
namely intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation. 
Although results in the literature are controversial, when 
facing our results we feel stimulated to carry forward our 
line of research, particularly undertaking trials to assess 
learning, memory and attention in children with OSDs. Our 
aim is to seek neurological causes and polysomnographic 
parameters that could explain changes in learning and 
cognitive function. 

CONCLUSION 


Children with OSDs (OSAHS and PS) performed 
worse in the learning test (Rey test) compared to children 
in the control group, and children with PS performed 
worse in the learning test compared to children with 
OSAHS. Attention tests results were similar between the 
three groups.
