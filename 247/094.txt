OBJECTIVE: 
To 
compare 
the 
postoperative 
recovery 
of 
patients 
receiving 
Coblation-assisted 
(Arthrocare, 
Sunnyvale, 
CA) 
intracapsular 
tonsillectomy 
with 
that 
of 
patients 
receiving 
traditional 
subcapsular 
electrocautery 
tonsillectomy. 
STUDY 
DESIGN 
AND 
SETTING: 
This 
was 
a 
prospective, 
randomized, 
double-blinded, 
controlled 
study. 
One 
hundred 
one 
children, 
aged 
2 
to 
16 
years, 
were 
randomized 
to 
Coblation 
or 
to 
conventional 
electrocautery 
tonsillectomy. 
Only 
patients 
with 
the 
operative 
indication 
of 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
were 
entered 
into 
the 
study. 
Intracapsular 
tonsillectomy 
was 
performed 
on 
the 
Coblation 
group, 
and 
traditional 
subcapsular 
dissection 
was 
performed 
on 
the 
electrocautery 
group. 
Adenoidectomy 
was 
performed 
with 
the 
curette 
in 
both 
groups. 
Outcome 
measures 
were 
assessed 
on 
days 
1, 
3, 
and 
5 
after 
surgery. 
These 
included 
child 
and 
parental 
rating 
of 
pain 
by 
using 
the 
Wong 
Faces 
pain 
scale, 
analgesic 
use, 
oral 
intake, 
and 
activity 
level. 
Patients, 
parents, 
and 
the 
nurse 
practitioner 
obtaining 
the 
outcome 
data 
were 
blinded 
to 
treatment 
arm. 
RESULTS: 
Treatment 
groups 
were 
similar 
in 
age, 
gender, 
and 
weight. 
Surgical 
time 
and 
estimated 
blood 
loss 
were 
similar. 
There 
were 
no 
complications 
in 
either 
group. 
Coblation 
patients 
had 
less 
pain 
and 
greater 
oral 
intake 
at 
all 
3 
time 
points. 
Percentage 
of 
normal 
activity 
level 
returned 
to 
>70% 
earlier 
and 
more 
frequently 
in 
Coblation 
patients. 
There 
was 
slightly 
decreased 
analgesic 
use 
on 
postoperative 
day 
5 
in 
the 
Coblation 
group. 
CONCLUSIONS 
AND 
SIGNIFICANCE: 
Children 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
undergoing 
tonsillectomy 
and 
adenoidectomy 
demonstrate 
significantly 
better 
postoperative 
recovery 
after 
Coblation-assisted 
intracapsular 
tonsillectomy.

Tonsillectomy 
remains 
one 
of 
the 
oldest 
and 
most 
common 
operations 
still 
performed 
today. 
The 
traditional 
tonsillectomy 
results 
in 
marked 
postoperative 
pain 
and 
significant 
limitations 
in 
activity 
and 
diet. 
Complications 
such 
as 
hemorrhage 
and 
postoperative 
dehydration 
may 
occur. 
Because 
of 
these 
significant 
morbidities, 
a 
variety 
of 
techniques 
have 
arisen 
over 
the 
years, 
with 
hope 
of 
decreasing 
the 
major 
morbidities 
of 
the 
procedure. 
These 
include 
cold 
knife 
dissection, 
snare 
excision, 
monopolar 
electrocautery, 
bipolar 
electrocautery, 
cryosurgery, 
suction 
electrocautery, 
bipolar 
scissor, 
KTP-532 
laser, 
CO2 
laser, 
Harmonic 
Scalpel 
(Ethicon 
Endo-surgery, 
Cincinnati, 
OH), 
microscopic 
bipolar 
diathermy, 
microdebrider, 
radiofrequency 
tonsil 
reduction, 
and 
Coblation. 


Coblation 
is 
a 
unique 
modality 
that 
can 
ablate 
tissue 
by 
generating 
a 
field 
of 
ionized 
sodium 
molecules. 
The 
device 
uses 
bipolar 
radiofrequency 
energy 
to 
ablate 
and 
coagulate 
soft 
tissue 
without 
thermal 
injury. 
During 
Coblation, 
conductive 
saline 
solution 
is 
converted 
in 
the 
gap 
between 
the 
device 
tip 
and 
the 
tissue 
into 
an 
ionized 
plasma 
layer. 
Where 
this 
plasma 
layer 
meets 
the 
tissue, 
there 
is 
adequate 
energy 
to 
break 
molecular 
bonds, 
resulting 
in 
molecular 
dissociation. 
Because 
this 
effect 
is 
achieved 
at 
temperatures 
of 
approximately 
40° 
C to 70° C, thermal damage to the tissue is minimized.1 


The 
electrocautery 
is 
a 
standard 
surgical 
instrument 
that 
is 
broadly 
accepted 
across 
a 
large 
number 
of 
specialties 
including 
otolaryngology. 
Compared 
with 
scalpel 
dissection, 
electrocautery 
provides 
excellent 
means 
for 
achieving 
precise 
surgical 
dissection 
with 
rapid 
hemostasis, 
which 
has 
resulted 
in 
it 
being 
one 
of 
the 
more 
popular 
methods 
employed 
in 
the 
United 
States. 
However, 
this 
device 
exposes 
tissues 
to 
thermal 
injury 
of 
at 
least 
400° 
C, 
and 
its 
use 
has 
been 
noted 
to 
increase 
postoperative pain and morbidity after tonsillectomy.2,3 


A 
number 
of 
studies 
in 
adults 
and 
children 
have 
indicated 
improvements 
in 
postoperative 
recovery 
in 
patients receiving Coblation tonsillectomy.4-8 The purpose 
of 
this 
study 
is 
to 
establish 
in 
a 
prospective, 
randomized, 
double-blinded 
fashion 
whether 
there 
is 
improved 
recovery 
in 
children 
receiving 
Coblation 
tonsillectomy, 
compared 
with 
children 
receiving 
traditional 
electrocautery 
tonsillectomy.

Standard questionnaire used to obtain outcomes measures. 

dered 
breathing 
were 
recruited 
into 
the 
study. 
Patients 
with 
significant 
comorbidities 
or 
significant 
history 
of 
recurrent 
or 
chronic 
tonsillitis 
were 
excluded. 
The 
study 
protocol 
and 
consent 
forms 
were 
approved 
by 
the 
institutional 
review 
board. 
Signed 
consent 
was 
obtained 
from 
the 
parents 
of 
all 
patients; 
patients 
were 
then 
randomly 
assigned 
to 
treatment 
groups. 
Patients 
and 
their 
families 
were 
blinded 
to 
assignment. 
Of 
128 
patients, 
27 
parents 
refused 
randomization, 
specifically 
requesting 
1 
of 
the 
2 
techniques 
(23 
Coblation, 
4 
electrocautery). 
The 
remaining 
101 
patients 
formed 
the 
prospective 
study 
cohort. 


Surgical 
Technique 


Coblation-assisted 
intracapsular 
tonsillectomy 
was 
performed 
with 
either 
the 
EVAC 
T&A 
or 
EVAC 
70 
handpieces 
(Arthrocare). 
Tonsils 
were 
ablated 
from 
the 
surface 
inward 
with 
the 
wand 
set 
at 
the 
“coblate 
9” 
setting. 
The 
wand 
skims 
the 
tonsil 
surface 
with 
continuous 
saline 
irrigation. 
Ablation 
was 
performed 
down 
to 
but 
not 
penetrating 
the 
capsule. 
Retraction 
of 
the 
tonsillar 
pillars 
is 
used 
to 
help 
define 
the 
margins 
for 
near-complete 
ablation. 
Only 
a 
thin 
layer 
of 
tonsillar 
tissue 
is 
left 
in 
situ 
to 
avoid 
penetration 
of 
the 
capsule. 
In 
most 
cases, 
no 
hemostasis 
was 
necessary; 
however, 
when 
it 
was 
required, 
the 
wand 
was 
used 
on 
the 
“coagulate 
5” 
setting. 
Electrocautery 
tonsillectomy 
was 
performed 
by 
using 
traditional 
subcapsular 
tonsil 
dissection 
with 
the 
Bovie 
set 
at 
20 
W. 
Adenoidectomy 
in 
both 
groups 
was 
performed 
with 
an 
adenoid 
curette, 
and 
hemostasis 
was 
achieved 
by 
using 


suction 
electrocautery. 
Anesthesia 
and 
recovery 
room 
protocols 
were 
standardized 
for 
all 
patients. 


Outcomes 
Measures 


All 
patients 
were 
seen 
by 
the 
pediatric 
otolaryngology 
nurse 
practitioner 
on 
either 
day 
1 
or 
2. 
During 
this 
visit, 
the 
following 
measures 
were 
collected 
and 
documented 
on a questionnaire (see Fig 1): (1) Perception of 
pain 
by 
both 
the 
parent 
and 
child 
as 
graded 
by 
using 
the 
Wong-Baker 
FACES 
pain 
rating 
scale; 
(2) 
type 
and 
frequency 
of 
pain 
medication; 
(3) 
presence 
of 
nausea 
or 
vomiting; 
(4) 
percentage 
of 
normal 
diet 
eaten 
by 
patient; 
(5) 
percentage 
of 
normal 
activity 
level 
demonstrated 
by 
patient; 
(6) 
whether 
or 
not 
parent 
missed 
work; 
and 
(7) 
complications 
or 
readmissions. 


Parents 
were 
later 
called 
at 
home 
by 
the 
nurse 
practitioner 
on 
either 
days 
3 
or 
4, 
and 
the 
same 
questionnaire 
was 
administered 
over 
the 
phone. 
This 
constituted 
the 
second 
assessment 
time 
point. 
This 
telephone 
call 
usually 
occurred 
over 
the 
weekend, 
which 
resulted 
in 
some 
parents 
being 
reached 
on 
day 
3 
and 
some 
on 
day 


4. 
The 
distribution 
of 
parents 
reached 
on 
day 
3 
was 
not 
different 
between 
the 
Coblation 
(67%) 
and 
electrocautery 
(69%) 
groups. 
The 
nurse 
practitioner 
then 
called 
the 
parents 
on 
days 
5 
or 
6 
to 
fill 
out 
the 
questionnaire 
for 
the 
3rd 
assessment 
time 
point. 
Again, 
the 
proportion 
of 
patients 
reached 
on 
day 
5 
was 
not 
different 
between 
the 
Coblation 
(65%) 
and 
electrocautery 
(65%) 
groups. 
After 
this 
final 
questionnaire 
was 
answered,

Until 
this 
time, 
both 
the

for 
equal 
or

variances, 
as

Statistical 
significance 
was 
accepted 
for 
P 
values 
of

RESULTS 


One 
hundred 
one 
patients 
were 
enrolled. 
Fifty-two 
received 
Coblation 
tonsillectomy, 
and 
49 
received 
electrocautery 
tonsillectomy. 
Mean 
age 
for 
the 
Coblation 
and 
electrocautery 
groups 
was 
6.4 
. 
3.5 
years 
and 
6.2 
. 
3.4 
years, 
respectively. 
Mean 
weight 
was 
28.5 
. 
19.1 
kg 
and 


30.2 
. 
23.2 
kg. 
In 
the 
Coblation 
and 
electrocautery 
groups, 
44% 
and 
51% 
were 
female, 
respectively. 
Operative 
time 
was 
similar 
between 
the 
2 
groups, 


28.5 
. 
19.1 
and 
30.2 
. 
23.2 
minutes, 
respectively, 
with 
no 
statistically 
significant 
difference 
(P 
. 
0.18). 
Recorded 
operative 
time 
included 
operative 
time 
for 
the 
adenoidectomy, 
as 
well 
as 
other 
minor 
procedures 
performed 
in 
conjunction 
with 
the 
surgery, 
which 
did 
not 
differ 
significantly 
between 
the 
2 
groups. 
Adenoidectomy 
was 
performed 
in 
all 
patients 
except 
in 
1 
Coblation 
patient 
who 
had 
a 
prior 
adenoidectomy 
and 
no 
adenoid 
regrowth 
seen 
at 
the 
time 
of 
tonsillectomy. 
Surgeries 
performed 
in 
conjunction 
with 
Coblation 
tonsillectomy 
included 
15 
bilateral 
tympanostomy 
tubes, 
1 
nasal 
endoscopy 
with 
cauterization, 
and 
1 
direct 
laryngoscopy. 
Surgeries 
performed 
in 
conjunction 
with 
electrocautery 
tonsillectomy 
included 
17 
bilateral 
tympanostomy 
tubes, 
2 
maxillary 
sinus 
lavages, 
1 
frenuloplasty, 
and 
1 
excision 
of 
tongue 
mucocele. 


Estimated 
blood 
loss 
was 
also 
similar 
between 
the 
2 
groups, 
16.2 
. 
27.2 
mL 
and 
26.8 
. 
42.9 
mL, 
respectively. 
Although 
there 
was 
a 
tendency 
in 
the 
electrocautery 
group 
for 
slightly 
greater 
bleeding, 
this 
was 
not 
statistically 
significant 
(P 
. 
0.17). 
Also, 
the 
electrocautery 
numbers 
were 
falsely 
elevated 
by 
1 
outlying 
case 
that 
involved 
300 
mL 
of 
blood 
loss. 
Eliminating 
this 
outlier 
resulted 
in 
a 
mean 
blood 
loss 
calculation 
of 


21.1 
. 
16.1 
mL. 
With 
both 
Coblation 
and 
tonsillectomy, 
almost 
all 
of 
the 
blood 
loss 
occurred 
in 
the 
adenoidectomy 
portion 
of 
the 
case. 
Usually 
with 
Coblation, 
essentially 
no 
bleeding 
at 
all 
was 
observed 
during 
the 
tonsillectomy 
portion, 
and 
no 
further 
coagulation 
was 
required 
at 
completion 
of 
tonsil 
ablation. 
In 
the 
rare 
instances 
that 
it 
was 
required, 
use 
of 
the 
Coblation 
wand 
in 
the 
coagulate 
5 
mode 
was 
extremely 
effective 
at 
achieving 
hemostasis. 
There 
were 
no 
complications 
in 
either 
group. 
There 
were 
2 
planned 
admissions 
for 
the 
Coblation 
group 
and 
3 
for 
the 
electrocautery 
group. 
There 
was 
1 
readmission 
for 
dehydration 
in 
the 
electrocautery 
group. 
Similar 
rates 
of 
nausea, 
respectively 
12% 
versus 
14%, 
and 
vomiting, 
respectively 
21% 
versus 
16%, 
were 
seen 
in 
the 
Coblation 
and 
electrocautery 
groups, 
respectively. 


At 
days 
1-2, 
3-4, 
and 
5-6, 
mean 
pain 
scores 
reported 
by 
the 
children 
receiving 
Coblation 
were 
2.5, 
1.9, 
and 
1.5, 
compared 
with 
4.6, 
4.3, 
and 
3.8 
in 
the 
electrocautery 
group (see Fig 2). Parental assessments of pain were 
slightly 
higher 
than 
the 
children’s 
reported 
scores—3.4, 
2.7, 
and 
1.9 
for 
Coblation 
patients 
and 
4.8, 
4.7, 
and 
4.5 
in 
electrocautery 
patients 
(see 
Fig 
3). 
These 
differences 
were 
statistically 
significant 
(P 
. 
0.005) 
in 
every 
comparison. 
The 
distribution 
of 
pain 
scores 
differed 
between 
treatment 
groups, as see in Fig 4. Up to 29% of electrocautery

mild 
pain 
at 
days 
1-2, 
and 
by 
days 
5-6, 
that 
proportion 
increased 
to 
69%. 
Likewise, 
the 
proportion 
of 
patients 
reporting 
severe 
pain 
(score 
from 
8-10), 
was 
significantly 
lower 
in 
Coblation 
versus 
electrocautery 
patients. 


As seen in Fig 5, analgesic use was similar between 
the 
2 
groups. 
There 
was 
a 
transition 
from 
Tylenol 
(Ortho-McNeil 
Pharmaceutical, 
Raritan, 
NJ) 
with 
codeine 
to 
plain 
Tylenol 
as 
recovery 
progressed. 
On 
days 
5-6, 
there 
was 
a 
statistically 
significant 
decrease 
in 
Tylenol 
use 
for 
the 
Coblation 
group. 


Coblation 
patients 
were 
able 
to 
eat 
more 
than 
electrocautery 
patients. 
On 
days 
1-2, 
3-4, 
and 
5-6, 
mean 
percent


age 
of 
usual 
diet 
was 
reported 
as 
49%, 
58%, 
and 
74% 
in 
Coblation 
patients, 
compared 
with 
30%, 
35%, 
and 
42% 
in 
electrocautery 
patients. 
This 
was 
statistically 
significant 
to 
P  0.005 at all 3 time points (Fig 6). By days 5-6, 75% 
of 
Coblation 
patients 
were 
eating 
80%, 
compared 
with 
only 
27% 
of 
electrocautery 
patients. 
Only 
4% 
of 
Coblation 
patients 
reported 
poor 
intake 
(0-30%) 
on 
days 
5-6, 
compared with 35% of electrocautery patients (Fig 7). 


Activity 
levels 
mirrored 
the 
oral 
intake 
findings. 
On 
days 
1-2, 
3-4,

5-6, 
mean 
percentage 
of

on

By 
days 
5-6, 
85% 
of 
Coblation 
patients 
were 
at 
near 
normal 
levels 
of 
activity 
(80% 
or 
better), 
compared 
with 
51% 
of 
electrocautery 
patients. 


One 
observation 
made 
during 
the 
study 
was 
that 
older 
children 
receiving 
electrocautery 
tended 
to 
have 
the 
most 
pain. 
Stratifying 
the 
analysis 
by 
age 
confirmed 
this 
impression. 
There 
were 
10 
patients 
in 
the 
Coblation 
group 
and 
9 
patients 
in 
the 
electrocautery 
group 
who 
were 
older 
than 
9 
years 
of 
age. 
When 
this 
subgroup 
was 
compared 
with 
patients 
younger 
than 
9 
years 
old, 
the 
improvements 
noted 
in 
the 
Coblation 
group 
were 
enhanced. 
As seen in Fig 9, pain scores were similar in the 
older 
and 
younger 
children 
receiving 
Coblation. 
However, 
pain 
scores 
were 
worse 
in 
the 
older 
children 


receiving 
electrocautery. 
The 
mean 
improvement 
in 
pain 
scores 
seen 
was 
only 
1.2 
in 
the 
younger 
children, 
compared 
with 
2.3 
in 
the 
older 
children 
at 
days 
1-2. 
The 
mean 
improvement 
seen 
at 
days 
5-6 
was 
2.4 
in 
the 
younger 
children, 
versus 
3.3 
in 
older 
children. 


There 
tended 
to 
be 
fewer 
parents 
having 
to 
miss 
work in the Coblation group (Fig 10), compared with 
the 
case

group; 
however, 
this 
was 
not

section. 
These 
results 
confirmed 
results 
published 
by 
Stoker et al,4 with the differences being greater number 
of 
patients 
in 
the 
present 
study 
(101 
vs 
89), 
double-
blinded 
versus 
single-blinded

design, 
intracapsular 
versus

tonsillectomy 
surgical 
technique, 
and 
single-surgeon 
single-site 
versus 
multiple 
surgeons 
at 
3 
clinical 
sites. 
One 
other 
question 
that 
can 
be 
raised 
is 
whether 
Coblation 
tonsillectomy 
would 
compare 
favorably 
with 
cold 
dissection 
techniques, 
which 
most 
believe 
result 
in 
superior 
recovery 
to 
the 
electrocautery 
dissection 
that 
was 
chosen 
as 
the 
standard 
control in the present study. Friedman et al5 indicates 
significant 
advantages 
with 
Coblation 
tonsillec


tomy 
compared 
with 
cold 
dissection, 
although 
his 
study 
is retrospective in design. Back et al9 found no advantages 
in 
recovery 
when 
comparing 
Coblation 
with 
cold 
dissection 
tonsillectomy; 
however, 
they 
did 
not 
perform 
their 
Coblation 
tonsillectomies 
in 
the 
fashion 
described 
by 
this 
study. 
They 
used 
the 
Coblation 
wand 
as 
a 
dissection 
tool 
to 
perform 
subcapsular 
dissection, 
exposing 
the 
underlying 
muscle 
and 
nerves. 
They 
also 
reported 
observing 
bleeding 
that 
could 
not 
be 
controlled 
by 
the 
Coblation 
wand 
when 
dissecting 
in 
this 
manner, 
and 
they 
actually 
used 
electrocautery 
in 
these 
cases 
to 
obtain 
hemostasis, 
a 
finding 
that 
differs 
distinctly 
from 
the 
present 
author’s 
own 
experience.

deed, 
it 
may 
be 
the 
intracapsular 
technique 
used 
in 
this 
article that provides the main advantage, rather than the 
specific use of Coblation. Koltai10 and Koltai et al11 
have 
reported 
significant 
advantages 
in 
recovery 
by 
using 
the 
microdebrider 
rather 
than 
Coblation 
but 
with 
similar 
intracapsular 
capsule-sparing 
tonsillectomy 
technique. 
The 
present 
author 
believes 
that 
Coblation 
provides 
superior 
intracapsular 
ablation 
compared 
with 
the 
microdebrider 
with 
regards 
to 
hemostasis, 
which 
is 
complete 
with 
the 
Coblation 
method 
but 
requires 
electrocautery 
to 
achieve 
with 
the 
microdebrider. 
However, 
the 
microdebrider 
has 
the 
significant 
advantage 
of 
providing 
effective 
removal 
of 
the 
adenoid, 
which 
the 
current 
Coblation 
device 
fails 
to 
achieve. 


Concerns 
have 
been 
raised 
regarding 
incomplete 
removal 
of 
the 
tonsil 
resulting 
in 
tonsil 
regrowth. 
This 
has 


not 
been 
observed 
to 
create 
any 
problems 
so 
far 
by 
the 
present author or by others in the literature5; however, it 
remains a valid concern. For this study, only patients with 
airway 
obstruction, 
rather 
than 
tonsil 
infection, 
were 
selected 
as 
appropriate 
patients 
for 
intracapsular 
Coblation 
tonsillectomy. 
There 
may 
be 
a 
small 
risk 
of 
regrowth; 
however, 
this 
risk 
is 
comparable 
to 
that 
for 
adenoidectomy, 
in 
which 
a 
subcapsular 
dissection 
is 
not 
possible. 
There 
is 
a 
definite 
learning 
curve 
and 
experience 
that 
are 
required 
to 
achieve 
near-complete 
ablation 
of 
the 
tonsil 
by 
using 
the 
Coblation 
wand 
with 
an 
intracapsular 
technique. 
The 
tonsil 
is 
ablated 
right 
down 
to 
the 
capsule 
so 
that 
less 
than 
5% 
of 
the 
tonsil 
is 
left 
intact. 
Significant 
experience 
with 
the 
device 
is 
necessary 
to 
achieve 
this 
without 
penetrating 
the 
capsule 
and 
exposing 
the 
underlying 
pharyngeal 
muscles, 
blood 
vessels, 
and 
nerves, 
particularly 
in

CHANG 


cases 
with 
deeply 
endophytic 
tonsils. 
Lesser 
removal 
of 
the 
tonsil, 
leaving 
10% 
of 
the 
tonsil 
intact, 
lessens 
this 
risk 
but 
probably 
significantly 
increases 
the 
risk 
of 
tonsillar 
regrowth. 
Whether 
or 
not 
this 
tonsillar 
regrowth 
results 
in a clinical difference remains to be seen. Arya et al12 
recommended Coblation subcapsular tonsillectomy over 
Coblation 
intracapsular 
tonsillectomy 
(they 
identified 
this 
as 
“tonsillotomy” 
in 
their 
article) 
because 
of 
their 
findings 
of 
no 
difference 
in 
recovery 
between 
the 
2 
methods 
and 
because of more complete removal with the subcapsular 
dissection. 
Their 
study 
included 
14 
adult 
patients. 
A 
good 
question 
to 
ask 
at 
this 
point 
is 
whether 
there 
are 
any 
differences 
in 
recovery 
between 
the 
intracapsular 
and 
sub-
capsular 
Coblation 
techniques 
employed 
in 
children. 


There 
have 
been 
a 
number 
of 
articles 
suggesting 
an 
increased 
risk 
of 
hemorrhage 
in 
patients 
undergoing 
Coblation tonsillectomy.13,14 However, other investigators15,16 
have not found this to be the case, with Belloso 
et al15 even suggesting a lower incidence of hemorrhage 
(2.25% 
in 
the 
Coblation 
group 
vs 
6.19% 
in 
the 
control 
group). 
The 
present 
study 
cannot 
answer 
that 
question 
because 
hemorrhage 
was 
not 
observed 
in 
either 
treatment 
arm. 
The 
present 
author 
has 
found 
Coblation 
intracapsular 
tonsillectomy 
to 
be 
a 
procedure 
with 
essentially 
no 
intraoperative 
blood 
loss, 
rarely 
requiring 
even 
use 
of 
the 
coagulate 
mode 
of 
the 
Coblation 
device. 
When 
the 
present 
author 
has 
performed 
subcapsular 
Coblation 
tonsillectomy, 
arterial 
bleeding 
has 
been 
a 
frequent 
result 
with 
exposure 
of 
the 
arteries 
in 
the 
pharyngeal 
musculature, 
but 
this 
has 
been 
effectively 
controlled 
by 
using 
the 
coagulation 
mode 
of 
the 
Coblation 
device. 
Whether 
or 
not 
this 
increased 
intraoperative 
bleeding 
results 
in 
increased 
postoperative 
secondary 
hemorrhage 
has 
yet 
to 
be 
seen. 


Drawbacks 
of 
the 
present 
study 
design 
include 
the 
variability 
in 
days 
of 
assessment 
between 
patients, 
with 
days 
1-2, 
3-4, 
and 
5-6 
being 
grouped 
together. 
This 
was 
felt 
not 
to 
bias 
the 
data 
in 
any 
manner 
because 
the 
distribution 
of 
actual 
assessment 
dates 
was 
essentially 
the 
same 
between 
the 
Coblation 
and 
electrocautery 
groups. 
The 
flexibility 
in 
dates 
allowed 
for 
100% 
success 
in 
obtaining 
outcomes 
measures 
from 
the 
patients, 
particularly 
during 
the 
weekend. 
An 
alternative 
method 
would 
have 
been 
to 
just 
allow 
the 
parents 
to 
keep 
daily 
diaries 
and 
return 
them 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
study. 
However, 
the 
reliability 
of 
such 
reports 
and 
whether 
or 
not 
all 
such 
diaries 
would 
actually 
be 
returned 
was 
a 
concern 
for 
the 
present 
author 
in 
considering 
that 
method. 
A 
significant 
enhancement 
to 
the 
study 
would 
have 
been 
to 
choose 
a 
later 
final 
time 
point 
to 
assess 
the 
patients. 
On 
days 
5-6, 
although 
the 
Coblation 
patients 
were 
essentially 
near 
fully 
recovered, 
a 
significant 
proportion 
of 
the 
electrocautery 
patients 
still 
had

and 
it 
would 
have 
been

to 
have 
seen 
the 
patients 
on 
days 
9-10, 
when 
they 
should 
have 
more

In 
any 
case, 
despite 
these 
limitations, 
the 
results 
of 
this 
study 
are 
quite 
compelling.
