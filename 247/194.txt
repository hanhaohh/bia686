Objective: 
To validate the Child Health Questionnaire, 
measure quality of life in children with obstructive sleep 
apnoea and assess the impact of surgery. 
Methods: 
The primary carer of a consecutive series of 42 
patients with sleep disordered breathing referred to a paediatric 
otolaryngology clinic completed the Child Health 
Questionnaire (version PF 28). Questionnaires were analysed 
for data quality and completeness, item/scale correlation, 
internal consistency and discriminant validity, 
interscale correlation and reliability. Following overnight 
pulse oximetry 37 children were diagnosed with obstructive 
sleep apnoea and underwent adenotonsillectomy. 
Results: 
Child Health Questionnaire Physical Functioning 
28 demonstrated excellent measuring characteristics in our 
population. Compared with normative data, children with 

obstructive sleep apnoea and their carers suffer a significant 
quality of life deficit, involving 10 of 13 subscales of the 
Child Health Questionnaire. This was most prominent in 
parental emotional impact, general health perception and 
family activities. There was no correlation between the 
severity of obstructive sleep apnoea and quality of life indices. 
Following surgery, there was a significant improvement 
in all Child Health Questionnaire subscales, which became 
equivalent to healthy children. 
Conclusion: 
The Child Health Questionnaire Physical 
Functioning 28 is an accurate and reliable way of assessing 
the impact of obstructive sleep apnoea on the quality 
of life in children in Britain. This appears to be significant 
in most aspects of a child’s life, but is fully reversed 
following surgery. 

Sleep disordered breathing and obstructive sleep apnoea 
(OSA) are common conditions in childhood, with prevalence 
ranging from 3.2% to 12.1% for sleep disordered 
breathing and 0.7% to 10.3% for OSA.1–3 Both conditions, 
but primarily OSA, are associated with significant 
sequelae, including cognitive and behavioural abnormalities, 
possible impact on growth and cardiovascular complications, 
which seem to be reversed with surgical 
treatment.4 As a direct result, an increasing number of 
operations are performed for sleep disordered breathing 
and OSA whilst the rate of adenotonsillectomies for 
recurrent tonsillitis has been decreasing. 

In addition, both OSA and sleep disordered breathing 
have a significant psychological impact on the patients 
and their carers: parents may feel helpless and interpret 
the disturbed breathing pattern of their child as a sign of 
impending apnoea, resulting in significant stress and disruption 
in family relations. This may be further complicated 
by behavioural changes of the child, resulting 
directly from OSA.

The Child Health Questionnaire (version PF 28) is a 
sensitive and reliable generic instrument for measuring 
quality of life in young children through their parents’ 
responses, 5 and is a 28-item questionnaire evaluating 13 
areas of a child’s well being. These include physical functioning 
(PF), role/social–physical (RP), general health 
(GH) and bodily pain (BP), parental impact in terms of 
time (PT) as well as emotional impact (PE), family cohesion 
(FC), family activities (FA), role limitations social– 
emotional/behavioural (REB), self-esteem (SE), mental 
health (MH), behaviour–global behaviour (BE) as well as 
perceived change in overall health status (CH). It has 
been used extensively in studies assessing quality of life in 
children, including children with epilepsy,6 asthma7 and 
juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.8 

Although there have been a number of studies in the 
USA assessing the quality of life impact of paediatric 
OSA using disease specific questionnaires, namely the 
OSA-18,9–17 only two studies,18,19 have used a generic 
questionnaire. Neither of these two studies used overnight 
sleep oximetry for OSA diagnosis or validated the Child 
Health Questionnaire in their study sample. Following our 
use of the Child Health Questionnaire in children with 
adenotonsillar disease,20 we planned this first UK study to 
assess (i) the measuring characteristics of the Child Health

Questionnaire as well as (ii) the quality of life and impact 
of surgery in our study population of British children. 
Assessment of the measuring characteristics of the Child 
Health Questionnaire was important: Although it has been 
performed in different populations, cultural and social 
differences as well as divergent attitudes towards health 
and disease, different health systems and access to health-
care mean that their conclusions are not immediately 
applicable to this particular group of children. 

Materials 
and 
methods 


Design 


Prospective observational survey. 

Setting 


A tertiary, academic paediatric specialty clinic serving an 
inner city population of multiethnic background (St 
Mary’s Paediatric ENT Clinic, Paddington, London). 

Patients 


Consecutive series of 42 patients with sleep disordered 
breathing. Eligibility criteria included age from 1 to 
14 years and referral for snoring, apnoeic episodes and 
disturbed sleep pattern. Exclusion criteria were immunodeficiency, 
suspicion of neoplasm, other significant comorbidity 
and non-English speaking primary carer. 

Methods 


Child Health Questionnaire (version PF 28) was used. 
After review of the referral letter by the examining doctor, 
carers of referred patients were asked to participate in the 
study. The assisting nurse subsequently collected the completed 
questionnaires while the examining doctor 
remained blinded to their responses. The questionnaire 
was administered again, 3 months after surgery. 

Ethical 
considerations 


As this was a non-interventional audit, ethics committee 
approval was not applied for. All carers of patients provided 
verbal consent to participate in our study.

Assuming 80% statistical power (0.2 type b error) and 

0.05 type a error in a bi-directional hypothesis, a sample 
of 45 children was estimated to be sufficient for detecting 
a 10 point difference in any subscale between our group 
and normative data. Two tailed t-tests with Bonferroni 
adjustments for multiple comparisons were used for comparisons 
between groups. 
Results 


The study took place between November 2005 and June 
2006. The carer completing the questionnaire was the 
physical parent in 94% of the children (the mother in 
78%) and his/her median age was 35.1 years. Fourteen of 
42 (32%) carers worked either part or full time while 
their median educational level was O Level/GCSE. All 42 
carers completed and returned the questionnaires. The 
mean age of children was 6.1 years (median: 5.7; range: 
1–11). Twenty-two were boys and 20 girls. All 42 children 
had overnight oximetry. This demonstrated an 
average of 59 desaturation episodes (range: 0–160). Their 
average (lowest) oxygen desaturation was 74% (range: 
98–60%). 

Thirty-seven children had more than five apnoeic episodes 
per hour and were thus diagnosed with OSA, and 
subsequently underwent surgery. The postoperative questionnaire 
was completed by the parents 3 months following 
surgery.

multi-item scales had similar means and standard deviations 
and as a result did not require standardisation (physical 
functioning, mental health, self-esteem, parental 
impact in terms of time, emotional impact, family activities). 
However, that was not the case for general heath 
and behaviour–global behaviour (Table 1). 

Equal 
items

scale 
correlation. 
It is important that each 
item contributes equally to the individual construct being 
measured. This was assessed by comparing the item-scale 
Pearson correlation coefficients between the items that 
comprise the eight multi-item scales. For seven of eight 
scales, the items/scale correlation coefficients were very 
similar, with the exception of general health (Table 2). 

Items 
internal 
consistency 
(linearity). 
The absolute values 
of correlation coefficients between items and scales is a 
measure of the internal consistency of the scale. Generally 
a Pearson item-scale correlation >0.4 is considered 
acceptable and >0.6 is excellent. In our sample, all 23 
(100%) items contributing to multi-item scales were correlated 
with their scales with Pearson correlation coefficients 
>0.4, while 21 of 23 had correlation coefficients 
>0.6 (Table 2).

item with its scale is at least one (or preferably two) 
standard errors higher than its correlation with the other 
scales. In our sample, Fisher transformation (from r 
to z) 
was performed to facilitate comparison. All items (100%) 
demonstrated acceptable and 79% excellent discriminant 
validity (Table 4). 

Floor and ceiling effects (the frequency of lowest and 
highest scored answers) were investigated to assess the 
‘variability of answers’. The floor effect median was 2.5% 
(range 1.3–7.6) while the ceiling effect median was 38.5% 
(range 1.3–78.4), with the highest frequency of positive 
outcomes >50% observed for parental impact in terms of

and role/social–physical scale items. 

‘Reliability’ was assessed with the use of Cronbach 
alpha. Cronbach alpha were calculated for all eight multi-
item scales. They were >0.7 in seven of eight (87%) 
scales, failing in the case of general health. Median was 

0.85 (range 0.59–0.91; Table 4).

Discussion 


Psychometric 
issues 


As medicine is adopting a more patient-centred perspective, 
the use of questionnaires is proving valuable in the 
assessment of the impact of disease. However, the ability 
of a questionnaire to measure what it is supposed to be 
measuring can never be taken at face value: Differences in 
attitudes towards health and disease, cultural, social, 
financial disparities, different health systems and different 
ways of access to health-care mean that one questionnaire 
that was useful to measure the burden of a condition in 
one country may be completely useless in a different setting. 
With this in mind, we performed a psychometric 
validation of the Child Health Questionnaire in this 
group of children: We found that all questions were 
strongly correlated with the concept they were supposed 
to be measuring (excellent internal consistency) and more 

so than with the other concepts (acceptable discriminant 
validity). All concepts demonstrated good reliability 
(Cronbach alpha) and were clearly distinct between them 
(lower interscale correlation) with the exception of general 
health. In summary, we showed that the scaling characteristics 
of the Child Health Questionnaire (PF28) in 
our sample were very satisfactory. The only scale that did 
not demonstrate consistently good results was global 
health, which has been noted previously3 and reflects the 
heterogeneity of this particular subscale. 

Clinical 
issues 


This study has shown significant improvements in quality 
of life following surgery for obstructive sleep apnoea. 
Although several studies in USA have focused on the 
quality of life impact of paediatric OSA, their results can 
not be considered directly applicable in the United Kingdom: 
quality of life studies are culture-specific, reflecting 
the fact that emphasis on disease and aspects of health 
vary in different countries and cultures. This makes it difficult 
to extrapolate the results from one such study from 
one country to another, which prompted us to perform 
this study. 

We used a generic questionnaire as we feel that they 
are generally preferable to disease specific questionnaires 
for multiple reasons: First, they are designed to measure 
the patient’s overall well being, and not just a small area 
that is of interest to the clinician, and as a result they are

by definition, more relevant to the patient. Second, the 
fact that they can be used to measure health status in 
patients with different pathologies means that they can 
provide a common scale for directly comparing the 
impact of different disease processes. Finally, by producing 
generic health status data they can be valuable in 
informing health policy and management decisions such 
as those based on Quality Adjusted Life Years assessment. 
Their main drawback, however, is that they are generally 
considered to be a ‘crude’ way of measuring quality of 
life and are sometimes unable to detect small changes in 
health status or not sensitive enough to measure the 
treatment effect. In this study, we have shown that a generic 
quality of life scale can measure the health impact of 
paediatric OSA while maintaining excellent sensitivity to 
change following corrective surgery. 

This study has demonstrated that paediatric sleep disordered 
breathing has a significant impact on children 
and their parents, reflected by the statistically and clinically 
significant decreases in 10 of 13 subscales of the Child 
Health Questionnaire. The impact, although comparable 
to that measured in Flannery’s study, is more prominent 
than measured in Stewart’s study, which showed change 
only in physical but not psychosocial measures. Our 
results show that these children and their carers suffer 
significant morbidity, which merits treatment per 
se, and 
perhaps independently of the neurobehavioural or cardiovascular 
sequelae of OSA. In terms of quality of life, these 
children and their families suffer as much as children 
with rheumatoid arthritis or moderate asthma. 

Some of the children we assessed preoperatively had 
been diagnosed with sleep disordered breathing, and not 
necessarily OSA. The fact that their deficit in terms of 
quality of life was so prominent points towards the conclusion 
that OSA/sleep disordered breathing are part of a 
continuum, as reflected in prevalence and sequelae, and 
are interpreted as such by the parents. This is further 
supported by the fact that we found no correlation 
between OSA indices (lowest Saturation/Desaturation 
episodes) and Child Health Questionnaire scales. It is of 
interest that the criteria for the diagnosis of OSA are 
quite arbitrary – as stated in Paediatrics technical report 

– ‘normative standards for PSG have been chosen on the 
basis of normative distribution of data but it has not 
been established that they have any validity as predictors 
of complications’.23 
Our results highlight the fact that our population may 
be more severely affected than previously reported in US 
studies, with implications for management. This has been 
shown in other areas, such as OME (where studies in the 
USA.24 failed to show a cognitive impact of OME in children, 
in direct contradiction to similar studies in the 

. 
2007 The Authors 
UK.25) This could be the result of different access to 
health care in the UK compared with the USA, as NHS 
constraints and the ‘gatekeeper’ role of the general practitioner 
mean that only children with significant morbidity 
reach specialist attention. In terms of specific quality of 
life impact, we found that the subscales which showed 
the most significant impact were the emotional impact 
on the parents as well as the impact on family activities 
and the global health perceptions of the parents. 

Two of these three areas were also the ones more affected 
in Steward’s US study. This corroborates our results, 
and confirms a pattern – namely that parents interpret 
apnoeic episodes/sleep disordered breathing as potentially 
life threatening events: while we as clinicians are worried 
about the long-term sequelae, the parents are worried 
about their child stopping breathing, and in many cases 
have to stay awake. This is also reflected in poor health 
perception and also in disruption in family activities, further 
complicated by neurobehavioural and growth problems 
of the child, which can arise as a direct consequence 
of OSA. 

Importantly, we found that all the negative quality of 
life effects of OSA/sleep disordered breathing are reversed 
after surgery. This has been shown in previous studies, 
but must be interpreted with caution, as expectation bias 
from surgery can always skew such findings. However, 
the scale of improvement is impressive, and more 
importantly, is almost exclusively in the areas with more 
significant preoperative decrease, which makes it unlikely 
to be purely explained by expectation bias, and adds to 
the arguments for surgery. 

We recognise that our study has some limitations: foremost 
is the small number of patients recruited in our 
study. However, the number of patients was based on a 
priori 
power calculations and indeed it was planned as a 
preliminary study. The patients and their parents were 
not blinded to treatment, as it would be impossible by 
definition to have patients and parents unaware of surgery 
performed, although the doctor administering the 
questionnaire was blinded as to the intervention applied 
We appreciate that the open design of this study makes it 
vulnerable to introduction of bias, specifically expectation 
bias and the placebo effect of surgery. This is problem 
that is inherent in most studies of surgical interventions 
and is only partly addressed by the findings of decreased 
Child Health Questionnaire scores preoperatively. Additionally, 
the normative data we used came from a study 
performed in the UK in 2001 and refer to children older 
than the ones we studied: we appreciate that this difference 
in ages could make the comparison problematic. 
However, the results of children after surgery mirror these 
normative data, and we feel that differences in age are

unlikely to account for the gap between children with 
sleep disordered breathing and healthy children. 

In summary, we found that in a British cohort of children 
with sleep disordered breathing, there is a significant 
impact in almost all areas of Quality of life that is fully 
reversed by surgery. Although this was only a preliminary 
study, we hope that it will generate further research in 
this area, that will help us understand better these vulnerable 
patients and their carers.
