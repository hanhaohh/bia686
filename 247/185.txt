Objective: To evaluate neurocognitive functions of children with obstructive 
sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), before and after adenotonsillectomy, 
compared with healthy controls. 
Design: Prospective study. 
Patients and Methods: Thirty-nine children with OSAS aged 5 to 9 years 
(mean age, 6.8 ± 0.2 years) and 20 healthy children (mean age, 7.4 ± 1.4 
years) who served as controls, underwent a battery of neurocognitive 
tests containing process-oriented intelligence scales. Twenty-seven children 
in the OSAS group underwent follow-up neurocognitive testing 6 to 
10 months after adenotonsillectomy. Fourteen children in the control 
group were also reevaluated 6 to 10 months after the first evaluation. 
Results: Children with OSAS had lower scores compared with healthy 
children in some Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (K-ABC) sub-
tests and in the general scale Mental Processing Composite, indicating 
impaired neurocognitive function. No correlation was found between neurocognitive 
performance and OSAS severity. Six to 10 months after adenotonsillectomy, 
the children with OSAS demonstrated significant 

improvement in sleep characteristics, as well as in daytime behavior. Their 
neurocognitive performance improved considerably, reaching the level of 
the control group in the subtests Gestalt Closure, Triangles, Word Order, 
and the Matrix analogies, as well as in the K-ABC general scales, 
Sequential and Simultaneous Processing scales, and the Mental 
Processing Composite scale. The magnitude of the change expressed as 
effect sizes showed medium and large improvements in all 3 general 
scales of the K-ABC tests. 
Conclusions: Neurocognitive function is impaired in otherwise healthy 
children with OSAS. Most functions improve to the level of the control 
group, indicating that the impaired neurocognitive functions are mostly 
reversible, at least 3 to 10 months following adenotonsillectomy. 
Key Words: Sleep apnea, neurocognitive function, adenoids and tonsils.

committee approved the study protocol. 

Sleep Questionnaire 

A subjective report about sleep characteristics was obtained using a 
questionnaire that was filled out by the parents at the first meeting and 
again at the second meeting, 6 to 10 months later. The questionnaire consisted 
of a total of 26 questions about the sleep behavior of the child. We 
chose questions based on questionnaires used in previous studies.6,7,19 
The parents were asked to rank the occurrence of several sleep characteristics 
on a scale of 0 to 4: 0-never, 1-seldom, 2-sometimes, 3-often, 4almost 
every night. The other part of the questionnaire included questions 
about socioeconomic status, general health, and daytime behavior 
of the child (Appendix). 

Neurocognitive Assessment 

All subjects were tested at their homes between the hours of 2:00 PM 
and 6:00 PM by qualified testers. The testers were not involved in the 
process of treatment and recruitment of the children, were blinded to the 
child’s diagnosis (OSAS or control), but were not fully blinded to the 
repeated test because the same tester performed both evaluations for 
each child. The chosen battery was based on the Kaufman Assessment 
Battery for Children (K-ABC). The K-ABC is the only intelligence test 
that has valid norms for Israeli children20 between the ages of 3 to 13 
years, namely, is appropriate for the range of the subjects’ ages. In addition, 
the test is child oriented with colorful and game-like materials, 
which aid in maintaining rapport with the children. 

The K-ABC intelligence scales are process oriented; they focus on 
whether the stimuli are manipulated 1 at a time or simultaneously, 
regardless of item content.20,21 The test contains 3 scales: 2 scales of 
mental processing—sequential and simultaneous—and an achievement 
scale. Each scale contains several tests. The present research battery 
included only the Mental-processing Scales that measure problem solving 
in novel situations. The Achievement Scale was excluded because it 
intends to assess factual knowledge and skills and not pure cognitive 
functioning. In addition, the manual of the K-ABC enables the exclusion 
of 1 test of each scale while maintaining a valid score. In order to shorten 
the assessment duration, we excluded 1 subtest of each scale. 

The Sequential Processing Scale represents tasks (subtests) in which 
problems are solved by arranging the input in sequential or serial order. 
All of these tasks measure short-term memory characteristics. This scale 
includes subtests: (1) Number Recall, which measures the child’s ability 
to repeat, in sequence, a series of numbers spoken by the examiner. This 
task measures automatic auditory-vocal memory and (2) Word Order, 
which measures the child’s ability to point to silhouettes of common 
objects in the same order as those objects were named by the examiner. 

Figure 1—Study protocol of the evaluation (sleep questionnaires and cognitive functions) 
and treatment stages. In 26 of the 39 children with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome 
(OSAS), the first diagnostic evaluation included polysomnography. T&A refers to adenotonsillectomy. 
SLEEP, Vol. 26, No. 8, 2003 1000 


For school-aged children, Word Order measures this recall ability both 
with and without an interference task. This task assesses several skills: 
auditory-visual integration, auditory-motor memory, and retention without 
rehearsal. 

The Simultaneous Processing Scale represents the subtests in which 
input has to be integrated and synthesized simultaneously to produce the 
appropriate solution. It includes 4 subtests: (1) Gestalt Closure measures 
the child’s ability to “fill in the gaps” in a partially completed drawing 
and to name or describe that drawing. This task measures the following 
skills: perceptual closure, perceptual inference, and conversion of 
abstract stimuli into a concrete object; (2) Triangles measures the child’s 
ability to assemble several identical rubber triangles to match a picture 
of an abstract design; this task measures nonverbal concept formation; 

(3) Matrix Analogies measures the child’s ability to select the picture or 
design that best completes a 2-by-2 visual analogy; this task assesses 
analytic thinking; and (4) Spatial Memory measures the child’s ability to 
recall the location of pictures arranged randomly on a page; this task 
assesses immediate recall and spatial localization. 
Mental Processing Composite is a combination of the Sequential and 
Simultaneous Processing Scales and is intended as the measure of total 
intelligence in the assessment battery. The K-ABC provides individual 
scores for each subtest, total scores for both Sequential and 
Simultaneous Processing Scales, and a score that combines both, the 
Mental Processing Composite. 

Verbal Intelligence was assessed using the Vocabulary subtest from 
the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-R 95).22 The 
Vocabulary subtest consists of 25 words arranged in order of increasing 
difficulty. The child is asked to explain orally the meaning of each word. 
The task reflects the ability to learn and accumulate information and provides 
an estimate of intellectual capacity. Performance on this subtest is 
stable over time and relatively resistant to neurologic deficit and psychologic 
disturbance.22 Vocabulary is the most reliable subtest (r = .86) 
in the verbal scale of the WISC-R95.22 

Polysomnography 

The polysomnography (PSG) study was performed using a computerized 
commercially available sleep-monitoring system (SensorMedics 
Inc, Yorba Linda, Calif, USA) and streamed through to an optical disk 
for later analysis. The PSG was performed as previously described.2 

Scoring 

Scoring was done by a trained technician and reviewed by a trained 
polysomnographer. Sleep-wake and sleep stages were scored according 
to Rechtschaffen and Kales criteria.23 Arousals and awakenings were 
scored using the American Sleep Disorders Association criteria24 with 
appropriate modifications for children.25 The arousal index was calculated 
as the number of arousals per hour of sleep. 

Obstructive apneic and hypopneic events were scored according to the 
recommended pediatric criteria of the American Thoracic Society.26 
Obstructive apnea was defined as paradoxical breathing for at least 2 respiratory 
cycles with complete cessation of nasal airflow (airflow reduction 
of at least 80%). A hypopnea was scored when the paradoxical 
breathing was accompanied by a reduction of at least 50% in airflow, 
resulting in either an arousal or in oxygen desaturation of at least 4%. 
The respiratory disturbance index (RDI) was calculated as the number of 
respiratory events (apneas + hypopneas) per hour of sleep. The oxygen 
saturation variables included mean and nadir SaO2 and the desaturation 
index (the number of desaturation events [SaO2 decrease of at least 4%] 
per hour of sleep). The diagnosis of OSAS was based on a history of 
snoring, difficulty in breathing during sleep, and apnea witnessed by parents 
in children with obvious hypertrophied adenoids and tonsils with an 
RDI of at least 1 per hour. When the clinical diagnosis of OSAS was 
obvious (sleep questionnaire and physical diagnosis) and associated with 
kissing tonsils, PSG was not done. The need for adenotonsillectomy was 
determined by the pediatric otolaryngologist (AL) based on both clinical 

Neurocognitive Function in Sleep Apnea—Friedman et al 


and polysomnographic data.15 All children were followed after adenotonsillectomy 
in our outpatient clinic, but PSGs were not repeated after 
the operation as part of this study. 

Statistical Analysis 

Parametric tests were used when appropriate (for normally distributed 
variables): group t-test, paired t-test, and analysis of variance. 
Correlations were made using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient Test. 
For nonnormally distributed variables, we used nonparametric tests: 
Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, Mann Whitney U-Test, and Spearman 
Correlation Coefficient. Data analysis was performed using SPSS 
(SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Ill).

*Data are presented as mean ± SD. OSAS refers to obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. 

The magnitude of the changes in cognitive scores after adenotonsillectomy 
was calculated as the effect sizes and relative difference. Effect 
sizes are calculated by taking the difference between the means before 
and after treatment and dividing it by the standard deviation of the same 
measure before treatment. Effect sizes are used to translate the beforeand-
after changes in a 1-group situation into a standard unit of measurement 
that will provide a clearer understanding of health-status results.27 
Cohen28 defined an effect size of 0.20 as small, 0.50 as moderate, and 

0.80 or greater as large. The relative difference is calculated by dividing 
the difference between the pretreatment and posttreatment scores by the 
pretreatment score. 
RESULTS 

Subjects 

Between September 2000 and June 2002, 41 children with OSAS 
aged 5 to 9 years and 20 control children (10 boys and 10 girls, mean age 

7.4 ± 1.4 years) underwent neurocognitive testing. Two children were 
excluded from the OSAS group because their cognitive test results were 
more than 3 SD above the mean. Thus, 39 children with OSAS (25 boys 
and 14 girls; mean age, 6.8 ± 0.2 years) comprised the study group 
(Figure 1). Twenty-seven of the 39 children with OSAS had a follow-up 
neurocognitive evaluation, including questionnaires and cognitive testing, 
6 to 10 months after adenotonsillectomy. Twelve children were not 
reevaluated; 9 of the 39 children with OSAS did not undergo adenotonsillectomy 
(5 according to the otolaryngologist’s decision, 4 due to 
parental decisions), and 3 others did not return for the follow-up neurocognitive 
evaluation. Fourteen of the 20 children in the control group 
were also reevaluated using the same cognitive tests 6 to 10 months after 
the first evaluation (time controls). 
There were no significant differences between the 27 children who 
comprised the study group and the 12 who did not repeat the neurocognitive 
evaluation, with regard to their history according to the questionnaires, 
the baseline polysomnographic data, and the neurocognitive tests 
obtained at baseline. 

There were no significant differences between the OSAS group (n = 
39) and the control group (n = 20) in socioeconomic or health status, 
except for a higher prevalence of allergic rhinitis, asthma, and a tendency 
to use symptom-relieving medication in the OSAS group. There were 
no significant differences between the groups in number of hospitalizations, 
family history of snoring, and parents who smoked. 

Of the 39 children with OSAS, 26 had undergone PSG as part of the 
initial evaluation. Their mean RDI was 6.5 ± 4.3 (range: 1.0-20.3); their 
mean arousal index was 19 ± 6 (range: 11.9-25.2), and their mean desaturation 
index was 0.6 ± 0.7 (range: 0-2.7). The 9 children who did not 
undergo adenotonsillectomy had a lower RDI (4.3 ± 2.6; range: 1.5-7.6) 
as compared with the 17 other children who did undergo adenotonsillectomy 
(7.5 ± 5, range: 1-20.3).

lectomy revealed significant improvement in sleep characteristics, as 
reflected in questions concerning restless sleep (the score decreased 
from a median of 3 [range: 0-4] to 1 [range: 0-1], P< .01); breathing difficulties 
(from 3 [range: 0-4] to 1 [range: 0-4], P< .001); snoring (from 

3.5 [range: 1-4) to 1 [range: 0-4], P< .001); and apneas during sleep 
(from 2 [range: 0-4] to 0 [range: 0-2], p < .005). There were no significant 
changes in reports of bedtime and wake-up problems and of daytime 
sleepiness. Improvement in the child’s behavior during the day was 
shown in reports of restlessness (0.08) and tendency to be easily distracted 
(0.07). 
Neurocognitive Assessment 

Children with OSAS showed impaired neurocognitive 
performance compared with 
healthy children (Table 2). As compared with 
those of controls, the scores of children with 
OSAS were significantly lower in the K-ABC 
in the subtests Word Order (P< .02) and Matrix 
Analogies (P< .02) and in the general scale of 
Mental Processing Composite (P< .02). The 
trend of poorer neurocognitive performance 
was shown in most of the other K-ABC subtests 
(Table 2). There was no significant difference 
between the groups in the Vocabulary test of the 
WISC-R95. 

There was no correlation between neurocognitive 
performance and OSAS severity (represented 
by RDI or SaO2) or indexes of sleep 
fragmentation (number of arousals and awakenings) 
(Spearman correlation coefficient). 

Effect of Adenotonsillectomy 

Six to 10 months after adenotonsillectomy, 
children with OSAS demonstrated significant 
improvement in neurocognitive performance 
(Table 3). The mean scores improved significantly 
in the OSAS group in the subtests 
Gestalt Closure (P< .001), Triangles (P< .02), 
Word Order (P < .001) and Matrix Analogies (P 
< .02). None of these subtests changed significantly 
in the control group. All 3 K-ABC general 
scales showed significant improvement 
after adenotonsillectomy (Table 3): Sequential 
Processing Scale (102.8 ± 15.6 to 109.3 ± 19, P 
< .03), Simultaneous Processing Scale (101.4 ± 

12.1 to 113.8 ± 14, P < .001), and the Mental 
Processing Composite, a score that sums up all 
the K-ABC subtests, (102.1 ± 13.6 to 113.2 ± 
14, P< .001). Figure 2 shows the individual 
change between scores of the K-ABC scales 
before and after adenotonsillectomy in 27 children 
with OSAS and 14 controls. 
In order to compare the magnitude of the 
change in neurocognitive functions after adenotonsillectomy 
in the OSAS group, and in the 
second evaluation in the control group, we calculated 
the effect size and relative difference of 
the neurocognitive tests (Table 4). 
Improvement expressed as effect size of 0.2 
was documented in the OSAS group in all but 1 
of the K-ABC subtests. In 3 of the subtests 
(Gestalt Closure, Triangles and Word Order), 
the effect size was > 0.50, indicating moderate 
and more-meaningful change. The changes in 
scores in the control group were small in the 

subtests Triangles, and Matrix Analogies (effect size of 0.24 and 0.44, 
respectively). In the remaining subtests, the change over time in the control 
group was not significant (Table 4). The scores of the general scales 
improved significantly in the OSAS group, with large effect size for the 
Simultaneous Processing Scale (1.0) and Mental Processing Composite 
(0.86), and moderate effect size for the Sequential Processing Scale 
(0.44). Two of the general K-ABC scales also improved significantly in 
the control group, but the changes were smaller (effect size 0.38 and 0.33 
for Simultaneous Mental Processing and Mental Processing Composite, 
respectively). The relative difference of the changes for these 2 general 
scales was significantly higher in the OSAS group as compared with the 
normal controls (P< .01).

DISCUSSION 

The results of the present study confirm previous reports indicating 
impaired neurocognitive functions in children with OSAS. The results 
also show that treatment with adenotonsillectomy significantly improves 
most neurocognitive functions, at least in mild to moderate OSAS, when 
measured several months following therapy. The magnitude of the 
improvement was significantly higher in children with OSAS as compared 
with normal children who were followed as a control group. The 
finding that the mean scores of the cognitive tests of the OSAS group 
after adenotonsillectomy did not differ from the healthy controls indicates 
that the impairment in neurocognitive functions was mostly 
reversible, at least by 6 to 10 months following adenotonsillectomy. The 
children with OSAS were otherwise healthy children who had hypertrophied 
adenoids and tonsils with mild to moderate OSAS. Several months 
after their children’s adenotonsillectomy, parents reported significant 
improvements in their children’s sleep characteristics, as well as a tendency 
to improve behavior parameters, such as restlessness (P = .08) and 
the ability to maintain attention (P = .07). 

Neurocognitive Functions 

This study evaluated specific neurocognitive functions. The chosen 
test battery enabled examination of the cognitive-processing style 
among children suffering from OSAS. Performance in the K-ABC test 
reflects the ability of a child to obtain academic achievements.20 

When choosing the tests, we had in mind that, in adults, the most frequently 
reported impaired neurocognitive functions in patients with 
OSAS were verbal and visual short-term memory, attention capacity, 
problem-solving strategies, and general intelligence.29-32 Adults with 
OSAS display performance difficulties in assignments that require attention 
or immediate and delayed recall of verbal and visual information.
29,33 Other findings include impairments in high cognitive functions 
such as problem solving, executive functions, and sequential thinking 
and deficits in learning abilities.29,30,33,34 

Gozal7 has noted a link between sleep-disordered breathing and poor 
academic achievement, reporting a high prevalence of OSAS among 
first-graders in the lowest tenth percentile of their class, and an improvement 
in their school performance after adenotonsillectomy. Our study 
confirms that children with OSAS are at risk to be underachievers. We 
found significant differences between children with OSAS and a control 
group in cognitive tests that have been shown to correlate with academic 
functioning at school. Children with OSAS showed significantly poorer 
performance in the Matrix Analogies test. This particular test has been 
shown to correlate highly with school grades20,21 and requires analytic 
thinking, an essential factor in academic functioning. This subtest 
requires functions such as auditory-visual integration and auditory-
motor memory. Poor performance in this test indicates a short attention 
span.19,20 The fact that children with OSAS show a lower function in the 
Mental Processing Composite suggests that they do not process infor-

mation efficiently, thereby lowering their learning abilities and academic 
performance. Our findings cannot rule out the possibility of partial 
irreversible damage to academic function even after treatment.8 The 
impaired neurocognitive function found here can cause a cumulative 
deficit in academic achievements that may be detected only later in life. 
It can also cause an academic gap between the child and his or her classmates 
that requires time and effort to reduce. 

There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in the 
Vocabulary test. Findings in adults with OSAS are variable. Some studies 
reported lower function in this task as a result of sleep apnea,34 while 
others did not.29 Vocabulary reflects the child’s experiences and education 
environment and is alleged to be insensitive to neurologic changes 
in the brain.18 Functioning in this test reflects the continuous impact of 
the environment. The process of learning and accumulating information 
starts in infancy and is prolonged.21 This may explain why the test is 
resistant to possible neurologic impairment. 

Intermittent hypoxemia and disruption of sleep architecture are the 
main physiologic features of OSAS. Their relative contribution to the 
neurocognitive deficits is still unclear. Several studies in adults found a 
correlation between blood-gas measurements and neurocognitive performance.
29,31,33 The degree of nocturnal hypoxemia showed a positive correlation 
with the severity of neurocognitive impairment in tests measuring 
attention, problem solving, and short-term recall.29 Deficits of neurocognitive 
executive functions related to the prefrontal area in the cortex 
failed to improve significantly after treatment, suggesting irreversible 
anoxic disruption.30,31,35 Sleep disruption without hypoxemia 
may also cause impairment in cognitive functioning.32,36 It is likely that 
both hypoxemia and sleep fragmentation act synergistically in introducing 
neurocognitive dysfunction. Recently, Beebe and Gozal37 presented 
a theoretic model suggesting that restorative processes that occur during 
sleep, as well as functional homeostasis of the cortex, may be disrupted 
as a consequence of both hypoxemia and sleep fragmentation. In the present 
study, we did not find any correlation between measures of oxygen 
saturation (mean nocturnal SaO2, nadir SaO2, desaturation index), sleep 
disruption (number of arousals and awakenings per hour), or OSAS 
severity (represented by RDI) and the neurocognitive scores. Most children 
in the present study had mild to moderate OSAS without evidence 
of significant hypoxemia during sleep. 

The relatively small number in the control group presents a limitation 
of the study. It was difficult to recruit healthy children from the same 
school and socioeconomic status; however, we believe the statistical differences 
we found are still valid. In addition, the relatively small number 
(n = 26) of children with PSG data and the variety of neurocognitive 
variables limited the analysis, and a larger-scale study may be needed in 
order to evaluate the relationship between the different sleep characteristics 
and neurocognitive impairments. The fact that PSG was not repeated 
after adenotonsillectomy may represent another relative limitation of 
this study; however, we have focused on neurocognitive function. A 
repeat PSG could be useful to identify the sleep characteristics that are 
relevant to the improvement or nonimprovement in neurocognitive 
function. However, the fact that adenotonsil


in more than 80% of children is well documented.15-17

sillectomy. As seen in Table 4, the effect size of the change in neurocognitive 
function indicates moderate and large improvement in most 
tests.28 The general score of the Mental Processing Composite showed a 
significantly large improvement after adenotonsillectomy (effect size of 
0.86). An improvement of 11 points of IQ in the Mental Processing 
Composite following adenotonsillectomy is a very substantial change. 
This change enables the children to reach their original abilities and fulfill 
their cognitive potential. The relative difference in scores was significantly 
higher in children with OSAS as compared with the controls 
(Table 4). These findings demonstrate a significant improvement in the 
ability to process stimuli in sequential and simultaneous manners. 
Cognitive factors such as perceptual closure, inference, and organization 
improved significantly after adenotonsillectomy. In addition, visual and 
auditory short-term memory, as well as the ability to solve problems and 
to think analytically improved. These findings suggest that OSAS is a 
reversible disruptive factor to the neurocognitive function of children, at 
least in the short term (6 to 9 months after therapy). Theoretically, adenotonsillectomy 
could have affected neurocognitive performance secondary 
to improved hearing, not necessarily improved sleep characteristics. 


Additional longer-term studies, starting in children at a younger age, 
are needed in order to explore the mechanism of the neurocognitive dysfunction 
in children with OSAS, its relationship with OSAS severity, 
and the long-term consequences of sleep-disordered breathing in 
younger-age children. 

In summary, the present study confirms an impaired neurocognitive 
function in otherwise healthy children with mild to moderate OSAS due 
to hypertrophied adenoids and tonsils. Six to 10 months following adenotonsillectomy, 
most impaired functions improved to the level of the 
control group, indicating that the impaired neurocognitive functions are 
fully reversible.
