ABSTRACT 

Two daily school periods are mandatory in Brazil owing to a shortage of academic facilities, which Ccin decrease cognitive 
performance, especially in children with sleep-disordered breathing. This study aimed to verify the influence of starting 
time to school on cognition, comparing children with sleep disorders and normal children. Cognition was assessed in 
79 children with sleep-disorderfed breathing, 468 children with nonrespiratory sleep disorders, and 633 normal control children. 
We analyzed total sleep time, starting time to school (moming or afternoon), and grades. First grade morning students 
with sleep-disordered breathing had 8,04 higher odds for cognitive dysfunction than normal children. For children with 
sleep-disordered breathing, second and third grade moming students had higher odds for cognitive dysfunction than those 
who studied in the afternoon (3,69 and 4,07), Fourth grade moming students had 8,27 higher odds for cognitive dysfunction 
than first grade children. In conclusion, sleep-disordered breathing, grades, and starting time to school interact to 
affect cognition in Brazilian children, (J Child Nmirol 2005;20:400-404), 

The interaction between sleep disorders and problems of learning 
has been observed in children who have poor-quality sleep and irregular 
schedules for bedtime and who do not feel rested at school. 
Children who do not experience difficulties in getting up in the 
moming have more motivation for class,' Among sleep disorders, 
sleep-disordered breathing is associated with a reduction in cognitive 
performance, influencing memory, attention, and visuoconstructive 
abilities,^" related to hypoxemia and arousal. Researchers

disorders that cause an increase in arousals'^""^' also influence 
child development. Sleep-disordered breathing is still underdiagnosed^ 
in children and its relationship to cognitive dysfunction is 
considered controversial/'''''^^'' even in Brazil, where little research 
about sleep disorders is available,^""^^ 

There are insufficient schools for Brazilian children; therefore, 
two daily school periods were created for elementary education 
in public schools. The moming period begins at 7 AM and fmishes 
at 12 PM, and the aftemoon period begins at 1 PM and finishes at 6 
PM, This scenario imposes adaptations on Brazilian children in 
such a way that it is difficult for them to accomplish their school 
tasks and fulfill their cognitive needs. So we hypothesized that sleep 
disorders, principally sleep-disordered breathing, decrease the 
cognitive performance of BrazUian children and that starting time 
to school interacts negatively with sleep disorders, worsening cognitive 
perfomiance. 

The aim of this research was to verify the cognitive performance 
of 7- to 10-year-old children with sleep disorders compared 
with nomial children, in addition to analyzing the influence of 
starting time to school on cognition in sleep-disordered children 
compared with a nomial control. Our main hypothesis is that children 
with sleep-disordered breathing attending school in the moming 
have greater cognitive impairment than children attending 
school in the aftemoon period ovsdng to issues such as circadian 
rhythm, napping, and sleep restriction. 


Cognitive Dysfunction in Sleep-Disordered Breathing / Carvalho et al 401 

MATERIAL AND METHODS 

We studied 1180 7- to 10-year-old children from August 1999 to June 2000, 
proceeding with nine elementary public schools of the center-south region 
of Sao Paulo City, Brazil. We selected these schools from among 35 possible 
study groups. The Institutional Review Board of the Federal University 
of Sao Paulo approved the study protocol. The director of education, the 
principals of the schools, and the children's parents signed the consent form. 

We distributed 5400 copies of the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children 
from Bruni et al,™ adapted for Brazilian Portuguese. By June 2000,3612 
questionnaires completed by parents were returned and 589 were excluded 
because they were incorrectly filled out. For defmitions of habits related 
to normal sleep and sleep disorders, 3023 questionnaires were analyzed."' 
Six hundred forty children presented sleep disorders in the questionnaire^" 
and were all included for cognitive evaluation. We also chose 640 randomly 
selected normal children from 2383 children as a controi group. We adopted 
a stratified procedure for randomization to match for gender and age. 
Ninety-three children in the sleep disorders group and 7 children in the control 
group (100) did not attend schooi during the days that we applied the 
cognitive test, allowing for 1180 children analyzed. 

A team of 12 trained psychologists went back to the schools and 
assessed cognition in 547 children with sleep disorders and 633 normal chiidren 
through use of a screening test (Bender Visual Motor Gestalt Test'*^'"^. 
The psychologists did not Icnow to which group the children belonged. The 
Bender test assesses cognitive domains, such as learning, memory, and visuospatial 
abilities, which are necessary to integrate perception and motor 
skills in the process of understanding. This test is appropriate for screening 
cognition deficit because it is applied quickly (10 minutes) and its 
instructions are quite simple. The researcher psychoiogist who analyzed the 
Bender test was also unaware to which group the children belonged. 

We split the group with sleep disorders (547 children) into two groups: 
79 children (8.46 ±1.08 years) with sleep-disordered breathing and 468 children 
(8.40 ± 1.10 years) with nonrespiratory sleep disorders. The nonrespiratory 
sleep disorder group had children with disorders in initiating and 
maintaining sieep, arousal, sleep-wake transition, and excessive somnolence 
but did not contain children with sleep-disordered breathing. The criteria 
for the diagnosis of each modality of sleep disorders were those adopted 
by Bnmi et al.™ The sleep-disordered breathing diagnosis considered the 
answers to these questions: Does the child have difficuity breathing during 
sleep? Does the child not breathe during sleep? and Does the child snore? 
The questionnaire did not discriminate between primary snoring and 
obstructive sleep apnea. We compared cognitive performance among children 
with sleep-disordered breathing with children with nonrespiratory sleep 
disorders and normal children (8.40 ± 1.09 years). We analyzed the diagnosis 
of cognitive dysfunction according to the Bender test criteria"''^^-'^ and 
compared this with Brazilian data. We computed cognitive dysfunction as 
present or absent. We calculated the total sleep time according to parents' 
reports of sleep onset time and wake-up time. 

We analyzed (chi-square) the variable cognitive dysfunction for children 
with sleep-disordered breathing, children with nonrespiratory sleep 
disorders, and the normal control group (present = 1; absent = 0). We verified 
the effects of explanatory variable interaction by using models of 
binary logistic regression.*" The explanatory variables were sleep disorder 
(sleep-disordered breathing, nonrespiratory sleep disorders, and control 
group), total sleep time (< 8 hours and > 8 hours), starting time to school 
(morning or aftemoon), and grade (fu-st, second, third, and forth). The 
variable grade had a high correlation with age and was included in the initial 
model because it was more closely associated with cognitive dysfunction. 
We used the Wald Test to select a final model and to remove the main 

effects that were not in any of the interactions. We considered P < .05 as 
statistically significant. 

RESULTS 

Cognition revealed no significant difference when comparing normal 
children with children with sleep disorders, sleep-disordered 
breathing, or nonrespiratory sleep disorders. Total sleep time 
(P = .82) and norvrespiratory sleep disorders (P = .32) did not have 
a significant effect on cognitive dysfunction. When we compared 
starting time to school and grades, we found significant differences 
related to cognitive dysfunction that vi'as aggravated by 
sleep-disordered breathing (Table 1). 

Comparing Children With Sleep-Disordered Breathing 

and Normal Children 

The first grade children vdth sleep-disordered breathing who studied 
in the morning had 8.04 (95% confidence interval [Cl] 2.2-29.8) 
higher odds for cognitive dysfunction them normal children (Table 
2). For other grades, the odds ratio was not statistically different. 

Comparing Starting Time to School in Children 

With Sleep-Disordered Breathing 

The odds ratios for cognitive dysfunction for first grade children 
were the same between morning and aftemoon starting time to 
school (Table 3). The second and third grade children who studied 
in the morning had higher odds ratios than children who studied 
in the aftemoon (3.69; 95% Cl 1.1-12.6 and 4.07; 95% Cl 1.3-13.1). 
The fourth grade morning students had indications of higher odds 
ratios of cognitive dysfunction than the children who studied in the 
aftemoon (3.41; 95% Cl 1.0-11.6). 

Comparing Grades in Children With 

Sleep-Disordered Breathing 

Children Who Studied in the Morning 

Third grade students had 8.71 (95% Cl 2.1-35.6) higher odds for cognitive 
dysfunction than those of the first grade and had 5.52 (95% 
Cl 1.3-22.8) higher odds ratios than second grade students (Table 
4). Fourth grade students had 8.27 (95% Cl 1.&-42.4) higher odds 
ratios for cognitive dysfunction than those of the first grade and 
indications of higher odds ratios than second grade students (5.24; 
95% Cl 1.0-27.4). 

Children Who Studied in the Afternoon 

Fourth grade students had 5.67 (95% Cl 2.3-14.2) higher odds for 
cognitive dysfunction than children in the second grade (Table 5). 

DISCUSSION 

Cognition was not shown to be different between the normal children 
and the children with sleep disorders, sleep-disordered breathing, 
or nonrespiratory sleep disorders, but when we looked at the 
interaction between grade and starting time to school, we noticed 
increased odds for cognitive dysfunction among those children with 
sleep-disordered breathing. The youngest children (first grade/7 
years old) with sleep-breathing disorders, principally morning students, 
had higher odds for cognitive dysfunction than nonnal children 
did. Brazilian children who study in the moming spend less

time sleeping at night,^' and those with sleep-disordered breathing 
have additional resting problems, consequently ending up with 
cognitive dysfunction. 

This is in accordance with other published data that have 
demonstrated a higher prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing 
in 4- to 6-year-old children.*^ The sleep-disordered breathing symptom 
most characteristic of these children was difficulty in getting 
up in the moming, suggesting that these children need more sleep 
to feel rested.' Napping is common among children up to 7 years 
old and fulfills the function of restoring their attention during the 
waking period,^^ but it is not a substitute for sleep. 

An important factor evaluated with the Bender Test is atten{
jQj, 10,32^ the visuoconstructive ability being necessary for perceptive 
and executive functions. This factor was reduced in the 
children with sleep-disordered breathing, possibly because respiratory 
problems reduce the supply of oxygen to the brain, as 

described in the literattire.^"'''"'"''^'^" The effect of chronic sleep 
restriction or chronic sleep fragmentation^ on neurocognitive performance^'' 
is equal to the effect of 2 days of total sleep deprivation. 

The children with sleep-disordered breathing had increased 
odds of cognitive dysfunction with age. Social factors that are 
important in their development aggravate the organic causes (infections 
or anatomic structure) common in younger children. When 
young, the child is more malleable to the limits imposed by family 
and is able to attend and understand, for example, the necessity 
to sleep early and to wake up early. Older children are able to 
sleep later and wake up later. This reflects a new perception of their 
social world and the possibilities of exploring it. Theories, fantasies, 
concern, and difficulties of interaction begin to fill the thoughts of 
second, third, and fourth grade children, and this seems to be 
more motivational than sleep. This results in the children sleeping 
later, increasing their cognitive dysfunction risk, especially with children 
with sleep-disordered breathing.

When we analyzed the children with nonrespiratory sleep 
disorder, they did not show a greater risk of cognitive dysfunction 
when compared with nonrtal children.^'-^^ In the literature, there 
are indications of an association between nonrespiratory sleep disorders 
and emotional, parental, and other related problems and diseases 
(eg, asthma or allergies), but there is little information on 
cognition or learning problems.^"'^^"^'*'^''^^ Total sleep time was also 
not shown to be a risk factor for cognitive dysfunction, suggesting 
that the quality, rather than the quantity, of sleep can have a more 
negative influence on cognition. 

CONCLUSION 

Sleep-disordered breathing alone did not have an effect on cognition 
but further impaired cognition when combined with grade and 
starting time to school. 

Children show a biologic tendency to sleep later and wake up 
later as they get older, resulting in higher odds of sleep restriction. 
This fact, associated with Brazilian educational policy of two daily 
school periods (motrting and afternoon), is a clinical problem for 
children with sleep-disordered breathing. First grade children vnih 
sleep-disordered breathing who study in the morning compared with 
normal children had higher odds for cognitive dysfunction. The second, 
third, and fourth grade children who study in the morning had 
higher odds for cognitive dysfunction when compared with those 
who study in the afternoon. The older children (third and fourth 
grades) had higher odds for cognitive dysfunction than the younger 
children (ftrst and second grades). 

We suggest that public educational policy should take into 
account the clinical consequences of starting time to school and 
start classes at a later time in the morning for this age group.

ABSTRACT 

The aim of this study was to describe the clinical and neurophysiologic correlates of atypical absence seizures in children 
with intractable epilepsy. In a retrospective review, 19 children with videoelectroencephalographic monitoring (female 
n = 14; male n = 5) fulfilled the electroclinical criteria for this seizure type. Atypical absence seizures occurred in a spectrum 
of clinical conditions associated with educational disability and intractable seizures. In comparison with children 
with only atypical absence seizures, children with atypical absence in association with multiple seizure types were more 
likely to have severe educational disability (n = 11 of 13; P = .01), a slower ictal frequency (n = 10 of 13; P = .01), and slow 
background rhythms for age (n = 13 of 13; P = .03). This study illustrates the broad clinical spectrum in which atypical 
absence seizures are encountered. Differentiation between children with only atypical absence seizures and children vnth 
multiple seizure types can be useful with respect to potential academic ability. (J Child Neurol 2005;20:404-410).
