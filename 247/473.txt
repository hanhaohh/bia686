Study Objectives: To identify predictors of sleep-disordered breathing 
(SDB) in children who have undergone self-reported tonsillectomy and/or 
adenoidectomy (TA). 
Design: Observational study of pediatric participants in a longitudinal 
genetic-epidemiological cohort study of SDB 
Setting: Community-based; studies conducted at participants’ homes 
Participants: 577 children age <18 (10.8±4.2 SD) years; 53% female; 
48% Black; 76% with a family member identified with SDB 
Interventions: NA 
Measurements and Results: Medical history assessed by questionnaire. 
Physical measures made directly. SDB was assessed with overnight in-
home cardio-respiratory monitoring. 10% of children (n=60) had had aTA 
5.5±4.6 yrs previously. An Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI, events/hr) =5 
was found in a higher proportion of children with a reported TA than in children 
with no history of out surgery (35% vs. 13.7%, p<.001). A TA was 
reported more frequently for non-Blacks than for Blacks (13.6% non-
Blacks, 6.9% Blacks, p=.02). Among children who had a TA, significant 
predictors of SDB (AHI=5) were: Black ethnicity (SDB in 57% vs. 24% of 

Blacks vs. non-Blacks; adjusted odds ratio (OR): 3.85; 95% CI: 1.11, 
13.33) and obesity (OR 3.98; 95% CI: 1.05, 15.08). SDB also tended to 
be greater in children with a family member with SDB (OR 2.87; 95% CI: 
0.65, 12.07). 
Conclusions: Black children were less likely to have undergone TA but 
more likely to have SDB after TA surgery. These findings underscore the 
need to follow children post-TA and for evidence-based studies that define 
the role of TA in the management of pediatric adenotonsillar disease.

of subjects with laboratory-confirmed obstructive sleep apnea 
(probands) and 72 control families with 497 members. Eligible 
probands had an Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) of =20 (for 
adults), or a diagnosis of SDB severe enough to warrant treatment 
and at least two first-degree relatives living within driving 
distance of the laboratory. Exclusion criteria were: presence of 
major psychiatric disease, unstable congestive heart failure, renal 
failure requiring dialysis, or pulmonary disease with continuous 
oxygen dependence. As accrual progressed, eligibility requirements 
were expanded to include probands who were children 
(<18 years) with SDB, as identified by an AHI >5, the absence of 
genetic and craniofacial syndromes (e.g., Down syndrome), and 
the other criteria noted above. Neighborhood controls were chosen 
randomly from a list of friends/neighbors provided by affected 
probands who were studied during the first four years of the 
study.35 Later studies were limited to families of affected 
probands only. 

The sample reported in this paper included 577 children with 
acceptable limited-channel in-home overnight cardio-respiratory 
data (89% of all children <18 years enrolled in the cohort). The 
data included in the present publication are those derived from 
the first exam in which the subject (or subject’s parent) reported 
that a TA had been performed. If no TA had been reported on any 
exam, data from the initial (baseline) visit were analyzed. A TA 
was first reported on a follow-up exam for only four children and 
one child did not complete a home sleep study at the baseline 
visit; thus, data from 572 children were derived from the baseline 
visit, and data from five children were based on data collection 
from a follow-up visit. 

Protocol 

The study visits were described in greater detail previously.35 
Briefly, trained research assistants studied families at home or 
other convenient locations. Medical history, medication use, family 
medical history, ethnicity, and snoring symptoms were 
assessed with the Children’s Sleep and Health Questionnaire 
(CSHQ) or the Health and Sleep Study Questionnaire (HSSQ), 
previously described.36 Although similarly structured, these questionnaires 
contained different items relevant for younger and 
older children, respectively. The CSHQ, completed by a parent, 
was generally used for children <13 years of age (n=379; 66% of 
children). The HSSQ was completed by all adults (to identify 
maternal characteristics), and by children, generally =13 years of 
age, able to self-complete it, or able to complete it with some 
assistance from their parents (n=197; 34% of children). Data on 
maternal education were extracted from the mother’s HSSQ, 
when available. 

Overnight in-home cardio-respiratory monitoring was performed 
with an Edentrace I or II monitor (Eden Prairie, MN) 
measuring airflow (nasal/oral thermistry), chest wall impedance, 
finger pulse oximetry, and heart rate. Height and weight (and 
other physical and physiological data not reported here) were 
measured directly. Tonsillar size was noted on a four-point scale, 
rating the amount of lymphoid tissue relative to the visible posterior 
pharyngeal space (present to <25% visible pharyngeal 
space; =25 to < 50%; =50 to < 75%; and =75% of pharyngeal 
space).37 

The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review 
Boards of local hospitals (University Hospitals of Cleveland, the 

Louis Stokes Cleveland Department of Veterans Affairs Medical 
Center, and MetroHealth Medical Center) from which probands 
were recruited. Appropriate informed consent was obtained from 
all subjects or parent proxy for children. 

Definitions 

Boys younger than age 15 and girls younger than age 14 were 
classified as obese if their BMIs exceeded the 95th percentile for 
age and gender.38 Older children with a BMI=27 were considered 
obese. Children who underwent TA were defined by an 
affirmative answer to: “Have your child’s tonsils been removed?” 
and/or “Have your child’s adenoids been removed?” (CHSQ), or 
to “Have your tonsils and/or adenoids been removed?” (HSSQ). 
“Current loud snoring” and “history of loud snoring” were identified 
based on responses to a four-level Likert scale question on 
snoring intensity. “Loud snoring” was considered present when 
snoring was noted to be louder than “mumbling or talking.” 
When this was reported to have occurred or been noted over the 
last one month, the subject was considered to be a “current” loud 
snorer; subjects who reported that snoring of this intensity had 
ever occurred were considered to have a “history of” loud snoring. 
A history of any snoring was based on responses to a yes/no 
question regarding whether the subject had ever snored. Children 
with allergies were identified as those reported to have had a positive 
skin allergen test for pollen, dust, or mold. Doctor-diagnosed 
asthma was based on questionnaire responses. 

From the overnight cardio-respiratory studies, respiratory 
events were defined as cessations (apneas) or discrete reductions 
(hypopneas) in airflow or chest impedance; either event type was 
required to last at least 10 seconds and be associated with at least 
a 2.5% fall in oxygen saturation. Sleep time was estimated from 
visual inspection of the sleep record, correlated with a sleep diary 
completed by the subject. The record was considered as indicating 
“wakefulness” if the sleep diary indicated that the child was 
awake/sleep, or the record showed persistent movement artifact, 
frequent positional changes over a short time interval, or abrupt 
changes in heart rate unassociated with other physiological correlates. 
The AHI was determined by dividing the number of respiratory 
events by the estimated hours of sleep time. The AHI, 
which was calculated from these measures, has been shown previously 
to correlate excellently with that derived from full in-laboratory 
polysomnography.39 This definition was used to provide 
a consistent classification of SDB across age groups (for our 
other genetic studies.) The comparability of data derived using 
this definition to respiratory event definitions from the American 
Thoracic Society (ATS) consensus statement of standards for cardiopulmonary 
sleep studies in children40 was assessed in a sub-
analysis of 20 randomly chosen pediatric records (AHI 0 to 42) 
that were blindly re-scored. In these records, the AHI included all 
obstructive (absent airflow with continued effort) apneas regardless 
of desaturation, and hypopneas (reduced airflow, continued 
effort, and 4% desaturation). The correlation between the AHIs 
determined with these two approaches was excellent (Spearman’s 
r=.76, p<.0001). In regression analyses, SDB was defined by 
dichotomizing the AHI as <5 or =5. 

Data Analysis 

The distributions of AHIs were highly skewed and therefore

Data were analyzed using SAS version 8.1 (SAS Institute, Inc., 
Cary, NC). Bivariate comparisons of variables on all 577 children 
were made using procedures that accounted for correlated family 
data (using Proc Mixed for continuous variables or Proc Genmod 
and generalized estimated equations (GEE) for categorical variables). 
Analyses limited to the 60 children post-TA were conducted 
using both simple and multivariate logistic regression to 
assess the independent contributions (and odds ratios) for putative 
risk factors, both before and after adjusting for potential confounders 
(Proc Logistic). 

RESULTS 

Characteristics of the 577 children who did and did not undergo 
TA are summarized in Table 1 (column 1). The overall average 
age of the sample was 10.8±4.2 years. The numbers of males 
and females were roughly equal, as was the non-Black and Black 
distribution: the sample was 52% non-Black (98% white; 2% 
Hispanic or Asian) and 48% Black. About three-fourths (76%) of 
the sample was recruited from a family with a proband with laboratory-
diagnosed SDB, reflecting the study design of this genetic 
epidemiologic study. More than half the children had a history 
of any snoring; however, less than one-fourth had a history of 
loud snoring or were current loud snorers. Mothers of 22% of the 
children were college graduates. 

Sixty children (10.4%) had undergone a TA on average 

5.5±4.6 years prior to the current assessment. The group who had 
and had not undergone TA are comparable for age, sex, recruitment 
source (from an index or control family), and maternal education 
(p>.05) (Table 1, columns 2 and 3). Black children were 
significantly less likely to have undergone TA than other ethnic 
groups (Table 1; in the overall sample, 13.6% of non-Blacks vs. 
6.9% of Blacks had reported a TA; p=.02). Children who had a 
TA tended to be more obese and have a higher prevalence of doctor-
diagnosed asthma and self/parent-reported atopy (i.e., reported 
positive allergy skin tests). However, these differences were 
not statistically significant. A history of any snoring was more 
prevalent in those who had had TA than those who had not had 
TA (p=.02). A history of loud snoring also tended to be more 
common in the TA group than in the non-TA group (34% vs. 
23%). However, this difference was not statistically significant 
(p=.10). In contrast to the prevalence of a history of loud snoring, 
the prevalence of current loud snoring in the TA group was only 
20%, and quite similar to the prevalence in the non-TA group 
(18%). 

In the overall sample, the median AHI is 1.5 (0.7-3.3, 
interquartile range); 6.6% of subjects had an AHI=10, and 15.9% 
had an AHI=5 (Table 2). The group who had undergone TA 
showed a greater level of SDB than those who had never had TA. 
Of the TA group, 35% showed a post-TA AHI =5, compared to 
only 13.7% of children who had never undergone TA (p<.001). 
This disparity persisted at an AHI =10: 15.0% of children who 
had undergone TA also had that degree of SDB while only 5.6%

Similarly, the median AHI for the TA group was approximately 
twice as high as that for the non-TA group (3.0 and 1.5 respectively, 
p<.001). 

The influence of putative risk factors for SDB (AHI =5) 
among children who have undergone TA is summarized in Table 

3. The strongest univariate predictor of post-TA SDB in this sample 
was Black ethnicity (OR: 4.26; 95% CI: 1.34, 13.55). Fifty-
eight percent (11/19) of Black children who had had a TA demonstrated 
SDB compared to 24% of non-Black children (10/41). 
Among children with a history of TA, obesity also was associated 
with a significant (>three-fold) increased odds of SDB. In 
these unadjusted analyses, the other significant predictor (p=.01) 
of SDB was a lower level of maternal education, which may 
reflect social or environmental factors not measured in this study. 
Family history of laboratory-diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea 
(recruitment source) has an elevated unadjusted odds ratio of 
3.00; however, the confidence interval for this point estimate 
overlapped one, perhaps because of the relatively small number 
of neighborhood controls in the TA group. Age, time interval 
since TA, and gender were not associated with SDB in children 
who have had TA. 
We also explored whether snoring symptoms could be useful 
in predicting which children who have had surgery had SDB 
post-TA. Neither a history of any snoring nor current loud snoring 
differentiated the post-surgical groups with and without SDB 
(any snoring was reported for 76% of the children with SDB and 
67% without SDB; current loud snoring was reported for 23% 
and 15% of the non-SDB and SDB groups, respectively) 
(p’s>.10). 

In multiple logistic regression analyses (Table 4), after adjusting 
for age, obesity, and family history, Black ethnicity and obesity 
persist as independent predictors of SDB among children 
who have had a TA. Among children with a prior history of TA, 

SLEEP, Vol. 24, No. 7, 2001 

the model indicates that Blacks have an approximately four-fold 
increased risk of SDB compared to non-Blacks (OR: 3.85; 95% 

CI: 1.11, 13.33). Obesity similarly increased the risk of SDB 
approximately 4-fold (OR: 3.98; 95% CI: 1.05, 15.08). Similar to 
the unadjusted analyses, adjusted analyses suggested that high 
familial risk was associated with elevated point estimates (predicting 
an almost three-fold increase in SDB). However, the latter 
did not reach statistical significance in this sample. 
DISCUSSION 

SDB affects minimally between 1% to 3% of the pediatric 
population,2,3 and is associated with a number of adverse health 
effects. Surgery directed at removing adenotonsillar tissue is the 
most commonly recommended treatment for SDB in children. 
There are only limited data, however, that address the likelihood 
of persistent or recurrent SDB following surgery,7,18,33,34,41-43 and 
virtually no data that address the long-term efficacy of surgery, 
nor the variability in treatment responses across population subgroups. 


We analyzed data from children studied as part of a community-
based, ethnically diverse, epidemiological study to assess 
demographic and host factors associated with reported TA, and to 
determine predictors of SDB in children with prior TA. The sample 
was enriched with children from families with one member 
(usually an adult) with laboratory-diagnosed sleep apnea. 
Therefore, the overall prevalence rates for SDB and for SDB-
related procedures are probably higher than in the general community. 
Nonetheless, this sample provided an opportunity to 
explore potential differences among population subsets in the use 
of TA in a high risk, non-clinical sample. 

In this sample in which the overall prevalence of SDB (AHI 
=5) was 16% and a majority of children had relatives with diagnosed 
SDB, TA had been reported for 10% of children. Because 

826 Predictors of Sleep-Disordered Breathing in Children—Morton et al 


of the paucity of evidence-based data on TA outcomes, and the 
lack of pre-operative clinical data on our sample, we cannot 
assess whether the ratio of children with an elevated AHI to those 
who underwent a TA is appropriate. However, given an estimated 
annual incidence rate of 0.7% for tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy,
32 the percentage of children who had undergone 
surgery appears to be higher than one would see in a general sample. 


The current analyses showed that Black children were 50% 
less likely to have had a TA than other children in this urban sample. 
This finding is striking when interpreted in light of our previous 
data indicating that SDB is two to three-fold more prevalent 
among Black than White children in this cohort.4,44 The bases 
for the ethnic differences in TA in this largely urban sample are 
not clear. Differences were not explained by maternal level of 
education, a marker for socioeconomic status. Ethnic differences 
in access to and utilization of health services have been reported 
for other conditions and procedures in children.45,46 Similar to 
other conditions for which ethnic disparities have been reported, 
it is unclear whether differences in TA may have related to differences 
in health insurance status, or to cultural differences in 
the perception of SDB as a health problem or of attitudes regarding 
surgery. It is also possible that differences in reported TA 
were due to differential reporting of procedures by parents of 
White and Black children. In this regard, we assessed whether the 
proportion of subjects who completed the adult or child’s version 
of the health questionnaire differed by ethnicity, and found no 
differences (a CSHQ was completed for 66% of Black children 
vs. 65% of other children, p=.92). Finally, since TA may be performed 
for reasons other than SDB, it is possible that the prevalence 
of other conditions (infection, otitis) was higher among the 
non-Black than Black members of our cohort. 

The available data and use of standardized in-home overnight 
cardio-respiratory studies across a large sample (who underwent 
assessment regardless of clinical referral or symptoms) also provided 
objective information on SDB in children who had had a 
previous TA. At an average of five years following TA, 35% of 
this sample had evidence of SDB, as defined by an AHI=5. This 
prevalence of SDB in children with prior surgery exceeds the 
prevalence rates (10% to 29%) reported previously based on 
shorter term follow-up (one week to 12 months).7,18,33,34,41-43 
These findings indicate that TA does not eliminate the risk of 
SDB in children, especially Black children, obese children, and 
children with a family history of SDB. 

Nieminen recently reported that obstructive symptoms may 
continue when adenoidectomy alone is performed.47 Because of 
the limitations of the questionnaire data, we were unable to assess 
whether SDB was preferentially found in children according to 
the specific surgical procedure used. To explore whether we may 
have over-estimated post-TA SDB by including children who had 
only received an adenoidectomy, we used data from the younger 
children (whose questionnaire separately addressed each procedure) 
to examine trends according to which specific procedures 
had been reported. Among this group, 53% were reported to have 
had a tonsillectomy, including 38% who had had both a tonsillectomy 
and adenoidectomy. The median AHI of the “adenoidectomy 
alone” group was 3.02 (n=11), which was comparable to 
the median of the remainder (3.01, n=49). These findings provide 
evidence that our estimates of SDB were unlikely to have been 
driven by children who had only received an adenoidectomy. 

Nevertheless, systematically collected data on surgical procedures 
are needed to better assess the impact of specific procedures, 
or combinations of procedures, on long-term outcomes. 

There are few data that address optimal ways of identifying 
children at risk for SDB following TA. Previously recognized 
risk factors for persistent SDB include: a high pre-operative 
AHI);7,18,33,34,41-43 underlying co-morbidity;7,18,33,34,41-43 and an 
anatomically small airway.7,18,33,34,41-43 To our knowledge, no 
study previously had examined the role of ethnicity or family history 
in the occurrence of SDB post-TA. We found that Black children 
who had had a TA were approximately four-fold more likely 
to have had SDB as measured by objective monitoring several 
years after surgery, than were non-Black children who had had 
previous surgery. This finding provides evidence that there may 
be ethnic and familial differences in both the prevalence of SDB 
(as we demonstrated previously),4 as well as in the efficacy of 
surgery in eliminating SDB. Possible explanations for the higher 
prevalence of SDB in Black children compared to non-Black 
children who underwent a TA include: 1) a higher pre-operative 
prevalence of SDB, 2), more severe SDB in Black as compared 
to other children, or 3) different responses to surgery. 

Obesity also was associated with an increased risk of post-TA 
SDB (adjusted odds ratio 3.98) (Table 4). Obesity is a growing 
health problem among children, particularly Black children.48 
Since obesity is a risk factor for the presence and severity of 
overall childhood SDB,4,49 further studies of larger samples are 
needed to better assess the extent to which obesity modifies the 
efficacy of surgical interventions. Our findings are important in 
light of a recent report of increased levels of obesity following 
TA.50 Thus, the increased growth spurt observed in children postTA,
5-10 if associated with increased obesity, could put such vulnerable 
children at risk for recurrent SDB.49 Presently, it would 
appear reasonable to monitor growth in children post-TA, with 
consideration of reassessing SDB if symptoms reappear or obesity 
develops or increases. 

We also considered asthma and atopy, both of which have 
been associated with snoring or SDB4,51 in children, as potential 
risk factors for post-TA SDB. Although reported doctor-diagnosed 
asthma tended to be more prevalent in the post-TA SDB 
group, these associations were not significant. The relatively 
small numbers within each risk group may have prevented a 
definitive assessment of the role of respiratory allergies or airway 
inflammation in this sample. 

An important limitation of our study was the use of self-
reported TA. This restricted our ability to evaluate the pre-operative 
indications for surgery, and to definitively characterize the 
specific operative procedure. Although we do not know the 
extent to which SDB was the primary indication for surgery, our 
findings nonetheless indicate that children who have had a TA are 
at increased risk for SDB compared to children without such a 
history. Other than SDB, indications for TA include chronic adenotonsillar 
infection and chronic or recurrent otitis media. Thus, 
children who are referred for TA (which may include children 
with variable degrees of SDB, as well as those with other types 
of upper airway pathology) appear to have an increased risk of 
SDB compared to children who have not been referred for TA. 
Although individual levels of SDB may have improved following 
surgery, our data show that some degree of SDB was frequently 
present when these children were studied on average five 
years after surgery. These findings suggest that a history of TA 

SLEEP, Vol. 24, No. 7, 2001 827 Predictors of Sleep-Disordered Breathing in Children—Morton et al 


may be considered a “marker” for later risk of SDB. 

Although we did not have radiographic data to examine patterns 
of lymphoid hypertrophy in our study sample, we assessed 
whether SDB post-TA was associated with physical findings of 
tonsillar hypertrophy. None of the 21 children with an AHI=5 
were noted to have tonsillar hypertrophy (as noted by tonsils 
occupying >50% of the pharyngeal airway) by a physical examination 
performed at the time of the overnight study. This suggests 
that marked tonsillar hypertrophy was not an explanation 
for the observed elevated AHI. We cannot exclude the possibility, 
however, that residual or recurrent adenoidal lymphoid 
enlargement explained the high rate of SDB in this population. 

In this study, as in our previous reports from this cohort,4,44 
SDB was characterized with in-home unattended cardio-respiratory 
monitoring, performed and evaluated across a large sample 
using standardized approaches. This approach has been used 
extensively in epidemiological studies to provide reliable estimates 
of the AHI that, in adults, correlate excellently with the 
AHI determined by conventional polysomnography.39 The optimal 
recording approach for sleep studies of children is an area of 
controversy. It is possible that the sometimes subtle changes in 
breathing pattern, particularly periods of hypoventilation, which 
occur in children with SDB are identified best with inductance 
plethysmography and measurement of carbon dioxide.40 
Recognizing that children may not desaturate as markedly as 
adults, we used a 2.5% level of desaturation (rather than a 4% 
used in many adult studies)52 to help identify hypopneas. We also 
identified hypopneas on the basis of changes in the amplitude of 
either the impedance or thermistor signal, an approach that may 
increase sensitivity compared to use of a single channel to identify 
breathing changes. We previously demonstrated that this 
approach for monitoring and scoring successfully distinguishes 
children with and without SDB symptoms.53 SDB was defined by 
a threshold AHI of =5. Although this threshold may differ from 
that used by some laboratories, it should be recognized that such 
criteria are dependent on the recording apparatus and scoring 
algorithms used.54,55 Different recording approaches and SDB 
definitions may possibly have identified slightly different subgroups 
of children. However, it seems unlikely that alternative 
definitions would result in qualitative differences in the findings 
of this study. Specifically, in a sub-analysis (see Methods), we rescored 
20 of the pediatric studies using ATS pediatric criteria40 
and determined excellent levels of agreement between both 
approaches. This supports the comparability of our scoring algorithm 
and argues against the presence of systematic biases. 
Additionally, we also assessed the extent to which subjects may 
have been re-classified had we used a different metric and threshold 
for “disease” identification. Among the 20 re-scored records, 
a disease-defining definition based on an obstructive apnea index 
of >1, as recommended by Marcus,56 would have classified two 
additional children as “affected” who would not have been so 
classified based on a AHI=5; and would have classified two children 
as unaffected who had a predominance of hypopneas and 
thus, still met our definition for “affected.” 

Although a high proportion of children with a prior TA had a 
significant level of SDB following surgery, the surgery may 
nonetheless have been partially effective in improving the level 
of SDB compared to pre-operative values. This is somewhat supported 
by the lower proportion of post-TA children who reported 
current loud snoring versus a history of loud snoring. 

Unfortunately, we only had pre- and post-TA AHI data on four 
children to quantify the effects of TA. In three of these four children, 
the pre-TA AHI was =5; in two children the post-TA AHI 
decreased (from 73 to 6, and 13 to 3), and in one child, it 
increased (from 19 to 42). 

In summary, this study utilized observational cohort data to 
identify predictors of SDB in children who have had TA. Our 
findings suggest a need for increased clinical follow-up of children 
who receive TA, especially for children who are Black, 
obese, and related to individuals with SDB. Additional work is 
needed to characterize the role of obesity and genetics as factors 
that may modify the effectiveness of surgery aimed at solely 
removing lymphoid tissue. Moreover, the finding of a lower proportion 
of TAs reported for Black children, who in our cohort 
appear to be at most risk for SDB, identifies a potential disparity 
in health care access or utilization among the U.S. population. 
Further efforts are needed to identify which children are most 
likely to benefit from TA, which need long term follow-up, and 
which may benefit more from alternative treatments.
