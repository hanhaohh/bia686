ABSTRACT. Objectives. Excessive daytime sleepiness 
(EDS) is seen less frequently as a presenting complaint 
in children with sleep-disordered breathing than 
in adults. Instead, symptoms of hyperactivity are often 
described. We hypothesized that children with suspected 
sleep-disordered breathing (S-SDB) were both sleepier 
and more hyperactive than control subjects. Furthermore, 
we hypothesized that overnight polysomnographic parameters 
correlated with sleepiness and hyperactivity. 

Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted at a 
university-affiliated hospital and a community-based pediatric 
clinic. A total of 108 patients with S-SDB (mean 
[standard deviation] age: 7 . 
4 years) and 72 control 
subjects (8 . 
4 years) were recruited. A modified Epworth 
Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and the Conners Abbreviated 
Symptom Questionnaire were administered. Polysomnography 
was performed in patients with S-SDB. 

Results. Patients with S-SDB had a higher ESS (8.1 . 


4.9 vs 5.3 . 
3.9) and a higher Conners score (12.8 . 
7.6 vs 
9.0 . 
6.2) than control subjects. On the basis of adult 
criteria, 28% of patients had EDS. There was no difference 
in the ESS and Conners scores of patients with 
primary snoring and patients with obstructive sleep apnea. 
The ESS had weak correlations with polysomnographic 
parameters. 
Conclusions. Although the ESS score of children with 
S-SDB was within the normal range for adults, these 
children were sleepier and more hyperactive than control 
subjects. However, these data should be confirmed by a 
population-based study. Pediatrics 2004;114:768–775; obstructive

he childhood obstructive sleep apnea syndrome 
(OSAS) is a disorder of breathing during 
sleep characterized by prolonged partial 
upper airway obstruction and/or intermittent complete 
obstruction that disrupts normal ventilation 
during sleep and normal sleep patterns.1 It has an 
estimated prevalence of 1% to 2% among young 
children2,3 and can lead to serious morbidity and 
even mortality if left untreated.4–7 

In contrast to adults, excessive daytime sleepiness 
(EDS) is seen less frequently as a presenting complaint 
in children with sleep-disordered breathing 
(SDB).4,8–10 Symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity 
are often described.8 The prevalence of EDS in 
children with SDB has been shown to vary over a 
wide range, from as low as 8% to as high as 84%.7,9–12 
The significantly differing values may be attributable 
in part to a lack of standard assessment techniques 
for sleepiness in children. Previous studies have used 
different subjective criteria such as the use of parental 
report. Only 1 previous study used objective criteria 
to evaluate sleepiness in children with SDB.13 
The present study aimed to use a simple and inexpensive 
instrument, which has been validated in 
adults,14,15 to evaluate EDS in children with suspected 
SDB (S-SDB). 

We hypothesized that children with S-SDB were 
both sleepier and more hyperactive than control subjects. 
Furthermore, we hypothesized that parameters 
on overnight polysomnography (PSG) correlated 
with EDS and hyperactivity in these children. 

METHODS 

The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review 
Board of Johns Hopkins University. Informed consent was secured 
from the subjects’ parents or legal guardians. Assent was 
obtained from all subjects 5 years of age. Patients with S-SDB 
and control subjects were studied. Control subjects were screened 
using Brouillette’s scoring system.16 A modified Epworth Sleepiness 
Scale (ESS)14 and the Conners Abbreviated Symptom Questionnaire17 
for hyperactivity were administered to all subjects. 
Patients with S-SDB then underwent overnight PSG. 

Study Population 

S-SDB patients were recruited sequentially and prospectively 
from all new patients who were referred to the Pediatric Sleep 
Disorders Clinic at Johns Hopkins Hospital for evaluation of clinically 
S-SDB secondary to adenotonsillar hypertrophy. Children 
were included when they were aged 2 to 18 years. They were 
excluded when they had other medical or neurologic conditions, 
had craniofacial abnormalities, had undergone adenotonsillectomy 
or other upper airway surgery, or were on medications that 
could affect their level of alertness. All patients were seen by a 
pediatric sleep specialist, and those with possible sleep disorders

other than OSAS were excluded. Control subjects were recruited 
from a general pediatric clinic in a primary care setting and from 
the Dermatology Clinic at Johns Hopkins Hospital. 

Screening of Control Subjects 

Control subjects were screened for OSAS using Brouillette’s 
scoring system. Brouillette et al16 formulated a scoring system to 
determine the likelihood of OSAS on the basis of history alone. 
Three variables were included in this score: difficulty breathing 
during sleep, observed apnea, and snoring. A child with a score of 
1 had no OSAS, whereas a child with a score 3.5 had OSAS; 
scores between 1 and 3.5 were indeterminate. In our study, 
control subjects with an OSAS score 1 were excluded. 

Questionnaires 

Two questionnaires (a modified ESS and the Conners Abbreviated 
Symptom Questionnaire for hyperactivity) were administered 
to the child’s caregiver by a trained research assistant. In 
addition, questions were asked directly to the first 46 children 6 
years of age. 

The ESS is a measure of a person’s general level of daytime 
sleepiness.14 It is an 8-item questionnaire detailing an individual’s 
propensity to fall asleep during commonly encountered situations. 
Scores can range from 0 to 24. In adults, an ESS score 10 is taken 
to indicate increased daytime sleepiness.14 The ESS was modified 
slightly in this study to be more applicable to children. The mention 
of alcohol was deleted in question number 7. In addition, 
question 8 was taken to indicate that the subject was a passenger 
in the car (Appendix 1). 

The Conners Abbreviated Symptom Questionnaire for hyperactivity 
is a 10-item index from the Revised Conners Parent Rating 
Scale.17 This is used in rating children who are aged 3 to 17 years 
for the presence of inattention, distractibility, and overactivity. 
Raw scores may range from 0 to 30, with a score of 15 considered 
clinically relevant (Appendix 2). 

PSG 

Patients with S-SDB underwent an overnight polysomnogram. 
Control subjects did not undergo PSG. Standard PSG consisted of 
electroencephalogram (C3A2/C3O1); electromyogram (submental 
and tibial); electrooculogram (right, left); arterial oxygen saturation 
(Sao2), oximeter pulse wave form, and end-tidal carbon dioxide 
tension (ETco2); oronasal airflow using a thermistor; and 
thoracic and abdominal wall motion (piezo belts or respiratory 
inductance plethysmography). Sleep was staged based on the 
criteria of Rechtschaffen and Kales.18 Arousals were scored according 
to the American Sleep Disorders Association criteria.19 
Standard pediatric scoring criteria were used for respiratory 
events.1 Hypopneas were scored when there was a decrease in 
airflow 50% associated with either a 3% desaturation or an 
arousal.1 The apnea-hypopnea index was defined as the total 
number of obstructive apneas, hypopneas, and mixed apneas per 
hour of sleep. OSAS was defined as an obstructive apnea index 

1/hour.1,7 Severity of OSAS was classified on the basis of the 
obstructive apnea index, with mild OSAS having an obstructive 
index between 1 and 4/hour, moderate OSAS 5 and 9/hour, and 
severe OSAS 10/hour.20 Primary snoring (PS) was defined as 
snoring without episodes of apnea, desaturation, hypoventilation, 
or excessive arousals.21 Periodic limb movements (PLMs) were 
scored using the International Classification of Sleep Disorders 
(Revised) criteria.21 The scorer was blinded to the results of the 
questionnaires. 
Statistical Analysis 

Data were expressed as means and standard deviations, where 
appropriate. 2 analysis was used for categorical variables. The 
unpaired t test was used to compare ESS scores of patients with 
S-SDB versus control subjects, as well as the Conners scores of 
patients with S-SDB versus control subjects. The ESS scores of 
children who were younger than 5 years were also analyzed 
separately as children in this age group usually take daytime naps. 
To assess for the contribution of puberty to the degree of daytime 
sleepiness in our subjects, we analyzed separately the ESS scores 
of children who were older than 12 years (which was arbitrarily 
set as the cutoff age for puberty). One-way analysis of variance 
was performed to test the difference in ESS scores of patients with 

mild, moderate, and severe OSAS. Similarly, one-way analysis of 
variance was used to test the difference in Conners scores between 
patients with mild, moderate, and severe OSAS. As the Conners 
score has been studied only in children 3 to 17 years of age, data 
were reanalyzed with subjects younger than 3 years excluded. The 
Spearman correlation coefficient was used to describe the relationship 
between the ESS score and PSG variables, as well as between 
the Conners score and PSG variables. PSG variables evaluated 
include sleep efficiency, arousal index, apnea-hypopnea index, 
apnea-hypopnea index during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, 
Sao2 nadir, duration of Sao2 92%, mean ETco2, mean ETco2 
during REM sleep, peak ETco2, duration of ETco2 50 mm Hg, 
and PLM index. A Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons 
was used. 

RESULTS 

Study Group 

Of all subjects who were approached to join the 
study, only 1 family refused. A total of 203 consecutive 
children were recruited; 23 were excluded. 
Among the patients with S-SDB, 18 were excluded. 
Seventeen of these children failed to undergo a sleep 
study, and 1 had a sleep study done at another 
institution. Among the control subjects, 5 were excluded 
because of an OSAS score 1. Therefore, 
108 patients with S-SDB and 72 control subjects composed 
the study population. The 2 groups were not 
statistically different on the basis of age, gender, race, 
and type of insurance (Table 1). The type of insurance 
was used as a surrogate measure of socioeconomic 
status. Snoring was present in all but 1 of the 
patients with S-SDB. Twenty-two patients had a history 
of daytime sleepiness by parental report. 

ESS and Conners Score 

The first 46 children who were 6 years of age 
gave separate ESS scores from their parents. As the 
correlation between parent and child ESS score was 
good (r . 
0.71, P . 
.001), subsequent ESS scores were 
obtained from the accompanying caregiver alone. 
The mean ESS score given by parents of patients with 
S-SDB was significantly higher than that of control 
subjects (8.1 . 
4.9 vs 5.3 . 
3.9; P . 
.001; Fig 1). 
Taking an ESS score 10 as the cutoff for increased 
daytime sleepiness, 32 (28%) patients with S-SDB 
and 9 (12%) control subjects had EDS (P . 
.007). 
There was no significant difference in the ESS scores 
of patients who had S-SDB and were younger than 5 
years and those who were 5 years and older (8.2 . 


4.2 vs 8.1 . 
5.2, respectively). Likewise, the ESS 
scores of children who had S-SDB and were 12

the ESS scores of those who were older than 12 years 

(8.4 6.6). The ESS scores of patients with S-SDB and 
control subjects who were younger than 5 years (8.2

but the ESS scores of patients who had S-SDB and

The Conners score of patients with S-SDB (12.8 .

of control subjects (9.0 6.2; Fig 2), although it was 
lower than the score considered clinically relevant. 
Excluding children 3 years of age, the significant 
difference between the Conners score of patients 
with S-SDB and controls persisted (13.0 7.5 vs 9.0 

6.3, respectively). 
Subgroup Analysis 

The PSG results are shown in Table 2. Of the 108 
patients with clinically S-SDB, 63 (58%) received a 
diagnosis of PS on overnight PSG. The remaining 45 
(42%) had various degrees of OSAS. Twenty-one had 
mild, 8 had moderate, and 16 had severe OSAS. 
None of the patients with S-SDB fulfilled the criteria 
for PLM disorder. The ESS score of patients with 

Fig 2. The Conners score of patients with S-SDB was higher than 
the score of control subjects (P .001).

OSAS (8.3 5.6) was not statistically different from 
the ESS score of those who had a diagnosis of PS 
alone (8.0 4.5). There was also no difference between 
the ESS score of patients with mild, moderate, 
and severe OSAS (Fig 3). Similarly, the Conners score 
was not statistically different between patients with 
OSAS and those with PS (12.6 8.3 and 13.0 7.0 
for OSAS and PS respectively). There was also no 
statistically significant difference in the Conners 
scores of patients with mild, moderate, and severe 
OSAS (Fig 4). 

In children with OSAS, the ESS score had a statistically 
significant but weak correlation with the mean 
Sao2 during REM sleep (r 0.41, P .05), PLM 
index (r 0.40, P .05), apnea-hypopnea index (r . 
0.32, P .05), mean Sao2(r 0.31, P .05), and 
Sao2 nadir (r 0.31, P .05) but not with other 
parameters tested (Table 3). However, when the P 
value was adjusted for multiple comparisons using 
the Bonferroni correction factor, these correlations 
failed to reach significance. There was no significant 
correlation between the Conners score and PSG parameters. 


As most children with OSAS obstruct primarily 
during REM sleep,22 data were reanalyzed using the 
apnea-hypopnea index during REM sleep. No significant 
correlation was found between the ESS or Conners 
scores and the REM apnea-hypopnea index. 
However, ESS scores correlated with the mean Sao2 
during REM sleep. 

DISCUSSION 

To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate 
the use of the ESS score in children. We have 
shown that children with S-SDB were sleepier than 
age-, gender-, and race-matched control subjects. 
Our data also confirmed previous reports that children 
with S-SDB exhibit more symptoms of attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder than normal children. 
PSG parameters correlated only weakly with 
the ESS score and had no significant correlation with 
hyperactivity. 

Daytime Sleepiness 

EDS is a cardinal feature of adult OSAS.21 In children, 
it is relatively uncommon, but its reported 
prevalence has varied over a wide range.7,9–12 Although

did not reach the level generally set for EDS based on 
adult studies (ESS 10),14 it was statistically higher 
than the ESS score of control subjects. Therefore, as a 
group, we have shown that children with S-SDB are 
relatively sleepy compared with nonsnoring control 
subjects. 

An interesting finding was the lack of a significant 
difference between the ESS scores of children with 
S-SDB and control subjects who were younger than 5 

years. That children in this age group usually nap 
during the day may account for this lack of difference 
in parental perception of sleepiness. 

After classifying children who were referred for 
S-SDB into those with PS and those with OSAS, there 
was no significant difference in daytime sleepiness 
between these 2 groups. Daytime symptoms are traditionally 
thought to be absent in patients with PS.21 
Our results, however, suggest that snoring may in 

ARTICLES 771

itself be associated with sleepiness in children. Similar 
findings have been shown in adult studies.23,24 In 
a cross-sectional cohort of 5777 adults, the authors 
found that snoring was independently associated 
with excess sleepiness.23 In another adult study, daytime 
sleepiness, as measured by both ESS and multiple 
sleep latency test, was compared between normal 
controls and patients with either upper airway 
resistance syndrome (UARS), sleep hypopnea syndrome, 
or OSAS.25 There was a significant difference 
between the ESS scores of the controls versus the 
patients with SDB. However, the ESS and multiple 
sleep latency test were similar for the 3 patient 
groups. 

Classifying the children with OSAS in our study 
according to severity did not yield a significant relationship 
between the severity of OSAS and the degree 
of daytime sleepiness. It is possible that children 
may have varying susceptibility to the effects of 
OSAS severity, accounting for the lack of relationship. 
Previous studies have shown conflicting results 
in this area. Some adult studies have similarly shown 
this lack of relationship,26–28 whereas others have 
shown a positive relationship between OSAS severity 
and the degree of sleepiness.13,29 As there were 
only a small number of children with moderate to 
severe OSAS, it is also possible that our study was 
underpowered to detect a significant relationship. 

Relationship Between PSG Parameters and Daytime 
Sleepiness 

We found weak correlations between daytime 
sleepiness and the mean Sao2 during REM sleep, 
PLM index, the apnea-hypopnea index, and the lowest 
recorded Sao2. There was no significant relationship 
between daytime sleepiness and sleep efficiency 
or the arousal index. 

The link between the ESS score and PSG parameters 
is unclear. Some studies have shown significant 
correlation between these, whereas others have not. 
In adults with OSAS, sleep fragmentation as a result 
of recurrent arousal is thought to be the primary 
reason for EDS.30,31 Other factors have also been 
shown to correlate with daytime sleepiness, such as 
nocturnal hypoxemia and the apnea-hypopnea index.
32,33 In our study, none of the PSG parameters 
could be used to predict daytime sleepiness, as the 
correlations were weak. Similar findings have been 
shown in a number of adult studies.26,27,34 

The PLM disorder, defined as a PLM index 5, is 
believed to cause daytime sleepiness due to recurrent 
arousals, resulting in sleep fragmentation.21 Although 
none of the patients in the present study 
satisfied the criteria for this disorder, the PLM index 
showed a weak correlation with daytime sleepiness 
(Table 2). With this weak correlation, it is unlikely 
that PLMs contribute significantly to the daytime 
sleepiness in children with S-SDB. Using both objective 
and subjective measures of daytime sleepiness, a 
recent study also showed comparable findings.35 

The absence of a strong relation between PSG pa


rameters and daytime sleepiness in this study brings 
up the possibility either that we are not measuring 
the right parameter during routine PSG or that the 
commonly measured parameters in PSG are not sensitive 
determinants of daytime sleepiness. Sleep fragmentation 
seems not to be a major factor in the 
development of daytime sleepiness in children with 
OSAS, as there was no significant correlation between 
daytime sleepiness and the arousal index. In 
fact, previous studies have shown that apneas in 
children are terminated by arousal less often than in 
adults, leading to less fragmented sleep.36 Theoretically, 
measures of increased upper airway resistance, 
such as esophageal pressure swings, may be more 
sensitive determinants of daytime sleepiness. 

UARS, which is part of the spectrum of SDB, is 
characterized by EDS as a result of fragmented sleep 
caused by brief arousals not associated with discrete 
apneas or gas exchange abnormalities.25 It is diagnosed 
by demonstrating an association between 
esophageal pressure swings and arousals.37 As 
esophageal pressure was not measured in this study, 
it is possible that some of the subjects who were 
labeled as PS may actually have had UARS. However, 
in that case, we would have expected to see a 
correlation between the arousal index and the ESS 
score. 

Alternatively, subcortical arousals that have been 
shown to be common in children may also be contributing 
to sleepiness.38 The pulse transit time, 
which is a noninvasive measure of subcortical 
arousal, was found to be a more sensitive measure of 
sleep disruption than visible electroencephalogram 
(EEG) arousals.39 In addition, significant changes in 
spectral EEG characteristics have been shown in obstructive 
events not terminated by EEG arousal.40 
These measures of subcortical arousal, which are not 
part of the routinely measured parameters on PSG 
and were not analyzed in this study, may perhaps 
have a stronger relation with daytime sleepiness. 
This may be an area for future research. With the 
correlation, although weak, between sleepiness and 
oxygen saturation, hypoxemia may play a bigger role 
in the cause of sleepiness in children with SDB than 
EEG arousals. 

Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity 

On the basis of the Conners score, we found that 
children with S-SDB had more symptoms of attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder than control subjects 
(Fig 2). There was no difference in attentiondeficit/
hyperactivity symptoms between the PS and 
OSAS groups. 

These data confirm previous reports that children 
with SDB commonly manifest neurobehavioral complications, 
specifically hyperactivity and inattention.
2,5,41–43 It is interesting that the Conners score of 
children with OSAS was not statistically different 
from the Conners score of children with PS alone. 
Similar findings were shown in a recent study of 113 
children who were referred for S-SDB.42 There was 
no difference in the hyperactivity scores of children

who subsequently received a diagnosis of SDB by 
polysomnography and those without. These findings 
suggest that snoring by itself may affect a child’s 
daytime behavior. 

None of the PSG parameters measured in our 
study correlated to a significant degree with symptoms 
of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. 
Likewise, Chervin et al42 found no correlation between 
hyperactivity and respiratory parameters on 
PSG. However, they found a correlation between 
hyperactivity and the PLM index. This association 
was found only in patients with SDB. 

The absence of a relation between PSG parameters 
and symptoms of attention deficit and hyperactivity 
again indicates that we may be measuring the wrong 
parameters or that commonly measured parameters 
on nocturnal PSG are not sensitive determinants of 
hyperactivity. Hyperactivity has been proposed to be 
a child’s way of acting out daytime sleepiness. As 
such, measures of subcortical arousal associated with 
respiratory events may give better correlations with 
hyperactivity. 

It is important to note that we excluded children 
who were taking medications that could affect their 
level of alertness, including those who were taking 
drugs used for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. 
As such, our data may have underestimated 
attention-deficit and hyperactivity in children with 
S-SDB. In addition, differences in birth history and 
other medical conditions may have played a role. 
However, as we excluded those with significant 
medical conditions, it is unlikely that these factors 
played a major role. 

Study Limitations 

This study compared clinically referred children 
with S-SDB with control subjects from other clinics. 
Thus, clinical referral bias may account for the difference 
in ESS and Conners scores between patients 
and control subjects. The ESS and the Conners score 
are subjective methods of assessing sleepiness and 
hyperactivity and as such may also be prone to report 
bias. Of note, however, is that only 22 of the 108 
patients with S-SDB had a history of daytime sleepiness 
by parental report. Most children presented 
with chief complaints of snoring and witnessed apnea 
during sleep. Furthermore, all children were 
seen by a sleep specialist, and children with other 
types of sleep disorders were excluded. Nevertheless, 
it would be important to confirm these results 
with a population-based study. 

Our control subjects did not undergo a sleep study 
but were screened for OSAS on the basis of history 
using the OSAS score developed by Brouillette et 
al.16 This score has been shown to differentiate am 
individual with no SDB from one with OSAS, although 
it has not been shown to be effective at differentiating 
PS from OSAS. 

The use of a thermistor to measure nasal airflow 
has its limitations. Being a qualitative measurement, 
it is not as sensitive in detecting flow limitation, 
which may be associated with increased upper airway 
resistance or hypopneas.1 Nasal cannula pres


sure measurements, which have been validated in 
adults,44 have been shown to detect apneas, hypopneas, 
and flow-limited events not identified by thermistors 
in children.45,46 However, as this detects only 
nasal airflow, it may miss events in children who 
frequently mouth-breathe45,46 and in those who experience 
nasal obstruction.47 As such, to minimize 
the limitations associated with the use of a thermistor, 
we used the ETco2 wave form as an additional 
means of measuring airflow. 

It should be noted that the majority of subjects in 
both the S-SDB and control groups were black, reflecting 
the ethnic mix of our hospital’s clinical population. 
Thus, the study sample may not be representative 
of the rest of the United States. 

CONCLUSIONS 

In summary, we have shown that although the 
mean ESS score of patients was within the normal 
range for adults, children with S-SDB were sleepier 
and more hyperactive than control subjects. These 
findings have important implications in clinical practice 
as we have shown that even the mildest form of 
SDB may be associated with daytime symptoms. The 
long-term consequence of this is currently unknown, 
but it is possible that the neurocognitive functioning 
of a child may be affected. We have also shown that 
the ESS is a simple and useful test to administer to 
children. However, the results of this study need to 
be confirmed by a population-based study with a 
more representative population. Additional studies 
are needed to elucidate the causative factors for EDS 
and hyperactivity in children with S-SDB.

EUROPEAN ENVIRONMENTAL RULES PROPEL CHANGE IN U.S. 

“Generally stricter European laws reflect a different philosophical approach to 
regulation, says Dr Indra Spiecker, a lawyer specializing in comparative law and 
assistant professor for American law at the University of Osnabruck in Germany. 
American lawmakers primarily look to cost-benefit analysis, which holds that the 
benefit of imposing regulation should outweigh its cost. European nations have 
more readily embraced what is called the precautionary principle. Essentially, 
Europeans emphasize the cost of inaction, while Americans tend to focus on the 
cost of action.... The EU is now considering sweeping new regulation of its 
chemical industry that has unleashed what analysts here say is the biggest lobbying 
effort in Brussels ever mounted by American industry. The new law, known as 
Reach, would place the burden of proof of safety on the producers before its sale, 
rather than waiting for the problems to spur regulation later. It would force 
American chemical companies to comply with the legislation in order to continue 
exporting to Europe—and raises the fear of similar legislation in the United States. 
The chemical industry points out that few if any of the unregulated chemicals are 
causing obvious health crises and says the legislation is overly bureaucratic and 
expensive. The American Chemical Council has marshaled its members to alter or 
derail the legislation.”
