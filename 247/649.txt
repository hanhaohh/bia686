Objectives: 
To 
assess 
polysomnogram 
(PSG) 
results 
and 
global 
and 
disease-specific 
quality 
of 
life 
(QOL) 
in 
children 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
(OSA), 
before 
and 
after 
adenotonsillectomy, 
and 
to 
assess 
the 
association 
between 
PSG 
findings 
and 
QOL. 


Design: 
Prospective 
observational 
study. 
We 
performed 
overnight 
PSG 
using 
standardized 
techniques 
and 
assessed 
disease-specific 
and 
global 
QOL 
using 
validated 
instruments. 
Follow-up 
was 
assessed 
at 
1 
year. 
We 
compared 
QOL 
outcomes 
between 
children 
who 
underwent 
adenotonsillectomy 
and 
children 
who 
did 
not. 


Setting: 
A 
large 
tertiary 
care 
children’s 
hospital. 


Patients: 
Children 
with 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
who 
were 
suspected 
of 
having 
OSA. 


Intervention: 
Adenotonsillectomy. 


Main 
Outcome 
Measures: 
We 
evaluated 
PSG 
parameters, 
disease-specific 
QOL, 
and 
global 
QOL. 


Results: 
We 
enrolled 
47 
children, 
31 
of 
whom 
met 
PSG 
criteria 
for 
OSA. 
Disease-specific 
and 
global 
QOL 


were 
not 
significantly 
different 
between 
children 
with 
OSA 
and 
children 
without. 
Global 
QOL 
was 
significantly 
worse 
for 
children 
with 
OSA 
than 
healthy 
children 
on 
several 
subscales: 
general 
health 
perception, 
behavior, 
and 
parental 
impact–emotional. 
Children 
who 
underwent 
adenotonsillectomy 
had 
significant 
improvements 
in 
QOL 
scores 
and 
PSG 
parameters 
(apnea-hypopnea 
index, 
P=.004; 
minimum 
saturation, 
P=.004). 
We 
found 
significantly 
larger 
QOL 
changes 
in 
children 
who 
underwent 
surgery 
compared 
with 
children 
without 
surgery 
(subscales: 
infections, 
P=.01; 
airway, 
P=.002; 
swallowing, 
P=.02; 
and 
behavior, 
P=.03). 
No 
strong 
association 
was 
identified 
between 
QOL 
scores 
and 
PSG 
parameters. 


Conclusions: 
Children 
with 
OSA 
and 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
have 
significantly 
worse 
QOL 
than 
healthy 
children. 
However, 
the 
association 
between 
PSG 
findings 
and 
QOL 
was 
only 
moderate. 
Children 
with 
OSA 
treated 
with 
adenotonsillectomy 
demonstrated 
large 
improvements 
in 
disease-specific 
and 
global 
QOL 
as 
well 
as 
PSG 
parameters.

A
A
DENOTONSILLECTOMY 
IS 
A 
commonly 
performed 
procedure 
in 
the 
pediatric 
population, 
and 
in 
recent 
years 
there 
has 
been 
an 
increased 
frequency 
of 
surgery 
based 
on 
hypertrophy 
and 
sleep 
breathing 
disturbance 
rather 
than 
infectious 
pharyngitis.1,2 
Several 
studies 
have 
found 
that 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
(OSA) 
is 
improved 
or 
cured 
in 
most 
children 
after 
adenotonsillectomy, 
using 
different 
criteria 
for 
success 
including 
sleep 
study 
findings.3-8 
In 
addition, 
some 
disease-
specific 
quality-of-life 
(QOL) 
instruments 
have 
been 
developed 
for 
children 
with 
sleep 
breathing 
disturbance,9-11 
and 
studies 
of 
disease-
specific 
QOL 
in 
children 
with 
OSA 
have 
identified 
significant 
improvements 
after 
adenotonsillectomy.12-14 
Furthermore, 
global 
QOL 
is 
significantly 
impaired 
in 
chil


dren 
with 
tonsil 
and 
adenoid 
disease, 
including 
children 
with 
sleep 
breathing 
disturbance 
and 
hypertrophy.15 


Despite 
this 
recent 
evidence 
indicating 
the 
benefit 
of 
adenotonsillectomy, 
no 
prospective 
study 
has 
assessed 
sleep 
study 
parameters, 
disease-specific 
QOL, 
and 
global 
QOL 
in 
the 
same 
group 
of 
patients. 
Our 
prospective 
study 
reports 
QOL 
and 
sleep 
study 
findings 
from 
a 
group 
of 
children 
with 
a 
diagnosis 
of 
OSA 
indicated 
by 
a 
sleep 
study; 
most 
children 
had 
tonsil

underwent 
adenotonsillectomy 
during 
the

period.

QOL 
as 
well 
as 
polysomnogram 
(PSG) 
findings 
in 
these 
children. 
This 
study 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
institutional 
review 
board 
at 
Baylor 
College 
of 
Medicine. 
Children 
were 
enrolled 
based 
on 
suspicion 
of 
sleep 
breathing 
disturbance 
from 
a 
history 
and/or 
audiotaped 
evidence 
of 
loud 
snoring, 
sleep 
breathing 
disturbance, 
or 
witnessed 
apnea. 
After 
enrollment, 
all 
children 
underwent 
a 
comprehensive 
overnight 
multichannel 
PSG 
in 
the 
Children’s 
Sleep 
Center 
at 
Texas 
Children’s 
Hospital 
(Houston). 
Children 
were 
studied 
in 
the 
company 
of 
a 
parent 
or 
guardian 
for 
8 
to 
12 
hours 
in 
a 
quiet, 
darkened 
room 
with 
an 
ambient 
temperature 
of 
approximately 
24°C. 


The 
following 
parameters 
were 
measured. 
Airflow 
at 
the 
nose 
was 
assessed 
with 
a 
pressure 
transducer 
airflow 
sensor 
(PTAF 
2, 
model 
1287; 
Pro-Tech 
Services, 
Mukilteo, 
Wash); 
airflow 
at 
the 
mouth 
was 
assessed 
by 
oral 
thermocouple. 
End-tidal 
carbon 
dioxide 
levels 
were 
assessed 
with 
a 
sidestream 
end-tidal 
capnograph 
interfaced 
with 
the 
pressure 
transducer 
airflow 
sensor 
and/or 
oral 
thermocouple 
providing 
breath-by-breath 
assessment 
of 
end-tidal 
carbon 
dioxide 
levels 
(BCI 
Capnocheck 
Plus, 
model 
58550A4; 
Smiths 
Medical 
PM, 
Inc, 
Waukesha, 
Wis). 
Arterial 
oxygen 
saturation 
was 
assessed 
by 
pulse 
oximetry 
(model 
3012; 
Nonin 
Medical, 
Inc, 
Plymouth, 
Minn). 
Chest 
and 
abdominal 
wall 
movement 
were 
measured 
by 
piezo 
bands 
(CT 
2 
Piezo 
Respiratory 
Effort 
Sensor, 
model 
1585; 
Pro-Tech 
Services), 
and 
heart 
rate 
was 
measured 
by 
electrocardiogram. 
Bilateral 
electrooculograms, 
6 
channels 
of 
electroencephalograms, 
and 
chin 
electromyograms 
were 
also 
obtained, 
and 
bilateral 
leg 
and 
foot 
movement 
(Periodic 
Limb 
Movement 
Sensor, 
model 
1697; 
Pro-Tech 
Services) 
and 
body 
position 
(by 
observation 
of 
technologist) 
were 
continuously 
monitored. 
Snoring 
was 
assessed 
by 
a 
sensor 
(Piezo 
Snore 
Sensor, 
model 
1696; 
Pro-Tech 
Services) 
placed 
over 
the 
trachea. 
All 
measures 
were 
digitized 
using 
a 
commercially 
available 
PSG 
system 
(Rembrandt 
sleep 
software, 
version 
7; 
Medcare 
Diagnostics, 
Buffalo, 
NY). 


Sleep 
architecture 
was 
assessed 
by 
standard 
techniques.16 
Central, 
obstructive, 
and 
mixed 
apneic 
events 
were 
scored. 
Obstructive 
apnea 
was 
defined 
as 
the 
absence 
of 
airflow 
with 
continued 
chest 
wall 
and 
abdominal 
movement 
for 
a 
duration 
of 
at 
least 
10 
seconds. 
Hypopnea 
was 
defined 
as 
a 
decrease 
in 
nasal 
flow 
of 
at 
least 
50% 
with 
a 
corresponding 
decrease 
in 
oxygen 
saturation 
of 
at 
least 
3%, 
an 
arousal, 
or 
both. 
The 
obstructive 
apneahypopnea 
index 
(AHI) 
was 
defined 
as 
the 
number 
of 
obstructive 
apneas 
and 
hypopneas 
per 
hour 
of 
total 
sleep 
time. 
A 
composite 
severity 
score 
to 
describe 
the 
severity 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
was 
derived 
from 
the 
total 
of 
scores 
(0-4) 
assigned 
to 
the 
AHI, 
respiratory 
arousal 
index, 
minimum 
oxygen 
saturation 
value, 
number 
of 
drops 
of 
oxygen 
saturation 
below 
90% 
associated 
with 
obstructive 
apneic 
or 
hypopneic 
events, 
and 
maximum 
end-tidal 
carbon 
dioxide 
value 
(Table 
1). 
The 
range 
of 
composite 
severity 
scores 
was 
0 
(least 
severe) 
to 
20 
(most 
severe). 


A 
complete 
multichannel 
PSG 
was 
repeated 
1 
year 
after 
study 
entry. 
All 
sleep 
studies 
were 
funded 
by 
the 
grant 
from 
the 
National 
Institutes 
of 
Health 
(Bethesda, 
Md) 
that 
supported 
this 


study. 
Extensive 
neuropsychological 
testing 
was 
also 
performed, 
but 
those 
data 
are 
not 
reported 
in 
this 
article. 


There 
was 
no 
randomization 
or 
treatment 
assignment 
in 
this 
study. 
Each 
child 
was 
evaluated 
by 
a 
pediatric 
otolaryngologist 
(E.M.F.), 
and 
adenotonsillectomy 
was 
recommended 
if 
the 
child 
had 
adenoid 
and 
tonsil 
hypertrophy. 
Although 
not 
all 
children 
who 
were 
recommended 
for 
surgery 
actually 
underwent 
adenotonsillectomy 
during 
the 
study 
period 
for 
various 
reasons, 
such 
as 
parental 
preference, 
there 
was 
no 
systematic 
reason 
why 
children 
did 
not 
undergo 
surgery. 
All 
parents 
were 
contacted 
for 
QOL 
assessment 
of 
their 
child 
6 
months 
and 
1 
year 
after 
surgery, 
or 
after 
PSG 
testing 
was 
completed 
for 
patients 
who 
did 
not 
have 
surgery. 
Patients 
were 
defined 
as 
having 
OSA 
if 
they 
had 
an 
AHI 
of 
1 
or 
more 
per 
hour, 
which 
is 
the 
accepted 
diagnostic 
standard 
for 
pediatric 
OSA. 
Eligible 
children 
who 
did 
not 
meet 
this 
criterion 
on 
the 
PSG 
still 
received 
follow-up. 
Exclusion 
criteria 
were 
as 
follows: 
non–Englishspeaking 
parent 
or 
child; 
chronic 
medical 
conditions 
such 
as 
asthma 
or 
cardiac 
disease; 
a 
diagnosis 
of 
attention-deficit/ 
hyperactivity 
disorder; 
patient 
receiving 
any 
kind 
of 
stimulant, 
such 
as 
methylphenidate 
hydrochloride; 
genetic 
disorder; 
neurologic 
disorder 
including 
mental 
retardation, 
degenerative 
or 
metabolic 
disorder, 
or 
epilepsy; 
prior 
adenotonsillectomy; 
and 
craniofacial 
abnormalities. 


In 
addition, 
we 
collected 
QOL 
data 
from 
the 
caregiver 
parent 
at 
study 
entry 
and 
6 
months 
and 
1 
year 
after 
study 
entry. 
Global 
QOL 
was 
assessed 
using 
the 
Child 
Health 
Questionnaire– 
version 
PF28,17 
which 
is 
a 
validated 
and 
widely 
used 
instrument. 
This 
questionnaire 
is 
made 
up 
of 
multiple 
subscales 
representing 
different 
constructs 
of 
global 
QOL. 
Disease-specific 
QOL 
was 
assessed 
using 
the 
Tonsil 
and 
Adenoid 
Health 
Status 
Instrument, 
which 
is 
also 
fully 
validated.11 
The 
instrument 
is 
scored 
into 
subscales 
based 
on 
different 
types 
of 
problems 
caused 
by 
tonsil 
and 
adenoid 
disease: 
infections, 
airway 
and 
breathing, 
behavior, 
swallowing, 
health 
care 
utilization, 
and 
cost 
of 
care. 


Statistical 
analysis 
was 
performed 
using 
SPSS 
version 
10.0 
statistical 
software 
(SPSS 
Inc, 
Chicago, 
Ill). 
Associations 
between 
variables 
were 
assessed 
using 
the 
nonparametric 
Spearman 
correlation 
coefficient; 
a 
significant 
correlation 
was 
considered 
to 
be 
0.40 
or 
greater. 
For 
other 
comparisons, 
because 
an 
underlying 
normal 
distribution 
of 
the 
data 
could 
not 
be 
assumed, 
nonparametric 
statistical 
analysis 
was 
used. 
Analysis 
of 
changes 
in 
score 
over 
time 
was 
performed 
using 
the 
Wilcoxon 
signed 
rank 
test, 
and 
comparisons 
between 
groups 
were 
performed 
by 
calculating 
change 
scores 
and 
using 
the 
Mann-Whitney 
test. 
Comparisons 
between 
multiple 
groups 
were 
performed 
using 
the 
Kruskal-Wallis 
test. 
Statistical 
significance 
was 
set 
at 
P.05.

Table

shows 
the 
comparison 
of 
global 
QOL 
data 
for 
healthy 
children 
and 
the 
group 
with 
OSA. 
We 
compared 
the 
2 
groups 
using 
the 
2-sample 
t 
test, 
and 
scores 
were 
significantly 
different 
for 
8 
of 
12 
subscales, 
with 
scores 
always 
worse 
in 
the 
OSA 
group. 
Subscales 
with 
notably 
large 
differences 
included 
role/social 
limitations 
due 
to 
physical 
problems, 
bodily 
pain, 
behavior, 
general 
health 
perceptions, 
and 
parental 
impact– 
emotional. 


Of 
the 
31 
children 
with 
OSA, 
29 
returned 
for 
follow-
up 
at 
6 
months. 
Of 
that 
group, 
24 
had 
undergone 
adenotonsillectomy, 
and 
5 
had 
not. 
As 
mentioned 
previously, 
there 
was 
no 
treatment 
assignment 
or 
randomization 
in 
this 
study; 
all 
children 
were 
recommended 
for 
surgery, 
and 
there 
was 
no 
systematic 
reason 
why 
children 
did 
not 
undergo 
surgery. 
However, 
we 
wanted 
to 
explore 
the 
possibility 
of 
an 
actual 
difference 
between 
groups, 
even 
if 
unintentional. 
Therefore, 
we 
tested 
for 
differences 
between 
the 
2 
groups 
(surgery 
vs 
no 
surgery) 
by 
comparing 
baseline 
global 
QOL 
and 
disease-
specific 
QOL, 
and 
there 
were 
no 
significant 
differences 
between 
subscales 
on 
either 
instrument. 


As 
noted 
earlier, 
only 
19 
children 
returned 
for 
testing 
1 
year 
after 
treatment 
or 
enrollment. 
We 
compared 
QOL 
subscale 
scores 
between 
the 
6-month 
follow-up 
and 
1-year 
follow-up 
periods, 
and 
there 
were 
no 
significant 
differences 
identified 
between 
mean 
scores 
for 
any 
sub-
scale 
on 
either 
the 
global

or 
the

larger 
for 
the 
6-month 
group, 
we 
used 
that 
group 
for 
further 
analysis 
of 
the 
QOL 
data. 


Table 
5 
shows 
the 
change 
scores 
on 
the 
global 
and 
disease-specific 
QOL 
instruments 
at 
6 
months, 
with 
statistical 
comparison 
between 
the 
2 
groups 
using 
the 
Mann-
Whitney 
test. 
Despite 
the 
small 
sample 
size, 
significantly 
larger 
improvements 
were 
seen 
in 
the 
surgery 
group 
for 
several 
subscales 
on 
the 
disease-specific 
instrument 
as 
well 
as 
the 
behavior 
and 
parental 
impact–emotional 
subscale 
of 
the 
global 
instrument. 
These 
changes 
remained 
significant 
after 
an 
analysis 
to 
control 
for 
baseline 
effects. 


In 
addition 
to 
calculating 
statistical 
significance, 
we 
assessed 
clinical 
significance 
by 
calculating 
the 
raw 
change 
scores 
and 
standardized 
response 
means 
for 
subscale 
scores. 
Since 
scores 
on 
QOL 
instruments 
are 
not 
intuitive 
and 
can 
be 
difficult 
to 
compare 
with 
changes 
on 
objective 
testing, 
it 
is 
important 
to 
assess 
clinical 
magnitude 
so 
that 
the 
numeric 
change 
in 
score 
on 
a 
QOL 
instrument 
can 
be 
compared 
with 
an 
understandable 
change 
in 
clinical 
status. 
As 
a 
rule 
of 
thumb, 
a 
minimally 
detectable 
change 
in 
clinical 
status 
on 
a 
health 
status 
instrument 
is 
usually 
about 
7 
points 
on 
a 
100-point 
scale. 
Beyond 
the 
minimally 
detectable 
change, 
to 
assess 
the 
relative 
size 
of 
a 
numeric 
change, 
the 
standardized 
response 
mean 
(SRM) 
is 
often 
used. 
An 
SRM 
of 
0.5 
or 
greater 
indicates 
a 
moderate 
change 
in 
status, 
and 
an 
SRM 
of 
0.80 
or 
greater 
indicates 
a 
large 
change 
in 
status. 
The 
SRMs 
for 
the 
Tonsil 
and 
Adenoid 
Health 
Status 
Instrument 
were 
as 
follows: 
utilization, 
0.63; 
infections, 
0.72; 
airway, 
1.17; 
cost 
of 
care, 
0.68; 
and 
behavior, 
0.75. 
Therefore, 
the 
change 
on 
the 
airway 
subscale 
was 
large, 
and 
changes 
on 
the 
behavior 
and 
infections 
subscales 
approached 
the 
accepted 
threshold 
for 
a 
large 
change. 
The 
SRMs 
for 
the 
global 
QOL 
instrument 
were 
generally 
larger 
than 
a 
minimally 
detectable 
change. 


The 
PSG 
data 
for 
the 
children 
with 
OSA 
were 
as 
follows. 
Baseline 
mean 
AHI 
was 
14.8 
with 
a 
range 
from 
1.0 
to 
75.8, 
mean 
minimum 
oxygen 
saturation 
was 
82% 
with 
a 
range 
from 
46% 
to 
94%, 
and 
mean 
number 
of 
desaturations 
per 
hour 
was 
12.9 
and 
ranged 
from 
0 
to 


109. 
The 
mean 
composite 
severity 
score 
at 
baseline 
was 
8.32 
with 
a 
range 
from 
0 
to 
20. 
For 
children 
who 
completed 
the 
PSG 
1 
year 
after 
enrollment, 
the 
mean 
AHI 
was 
down 
to 
3.16 
(range, 
0-24.1), 
mean 
minimum 
oxygen 
saturation 
was 
up 
to 
91% 
(range, 
83%-96%), 
mean 
number 
of 
desaturations 
per 
hour 
was 
1.9 
(range, 
0-24.1), 
and 
mean 
composite 
severity 
score 
was 
3.94 
(range, 
0-13.0). 
Using 
the 
Wilcoxon 
signed 
rank 
test 
to 
compare 
results 
at 
baseline 
and 
1 
year, 
differences 
were 
statistically 
significant 
for 
3 
of 
4 
variables 
(AHI, 
P=.004; 
minimum 
saturation, 
P=.004; 
number 
of 
desaturations, 
P=.11; 
and 
composite 
severity 
index, 
P=.007). 
Nine 
(53%) 
of 
17 
children 
who 
completed 
a 
PSG 
at 
1 
year 
were 
cured 
(AHI1.0), 
and 
15 
(88%) 
of 
17 
children 
had 
a 
decrease 
in 
their 
AHI. 
We 
next 
explored 
associations 
between 
the 
PSG 
findings 
and 
QOL 
scores 
on 
both 
the 
global 
and

Because 
the 
airway 
subscale 
had 
reasonable 
correlation 
with 
PSG 
findings 
and 
logically 
it 
was 
the 
subscale 
most 
likely 
to 
be 
predictive 
of 
OSA, 
we 
explored 
those 
data 
to 
see 
if 
the 
instrument 
subscale 
scores 
could 
be 
used 
to 
predict 
the 
presence 
of 
OSA. 
All 
47 
children 
with 
sleep-
disordered 
breathing, 
even 
those 
who 
did 
not 
meet 
PSG 
criteria 
for 
OSA, 
were 
used 
for 
this 
analysis. 
A 
cross-
tabular 
evaluation 
revealed 
that 
of 
the 
8 
children 
with 
an 
AHI 
of 
0, 
none 
had 
an 
airway 
score 
of 
0; 
scores 
ranged 
from 
12.5 
to 
93.8 
with 
a 
mean 
score 
of 
47.7 
and 
a 
median 
of 
46.9. 
We 
performed 
further 
analysis 
by 
creating 
strata 
of 
children 
with 
similar 
AHIs; 
the 
mean 
airway 
score 
data 
are 
shown 
in 
Table 
7. 
As 
indicated 
by 
the 
correlation 
coefficient, 
children 
with 
higher 
AHIs 
tended 
to 
have 
higher 
airway 
subscale 
scores, 
but 
the 
range 
was 
very 
wide. 
Even 
children 
with 
a 
low 
AHI 
had 
fairly 
high 
airway 
scores. 
Statistical 
analysis 
comparing 
the 
groups 
revealed 
no 
significant 
difference 
(Kruskal-Wallis 
test, 
P=.63). 
From 
these 
data, 
we 
conclude 
that 
airway 
subscale 
scores 
should 
not 
be 
used 
as 
a 
screen 
for 
the 
presence 
of 
OSA. 


COMMENT
Adenotonsillectomy 
continues 
to

a

in 
the

1 
year

A

from

assessed 
50 
children

before

after

and 
93%

Two 
other 
studies 
have 
used 
validated 
instruments 
to 
assess 
changes 
in 
QOL 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
in 
children 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
breathing 
disorder.12,14 
One 
prospective 
study 
used 
the 
OSD-6,9 
which 
is 
a 
validated 
6-item 
instrument 
completed 
by 
the 
parent 
or 
caregiver. 
In 
that 
study, 
101 
children 
(mean 
age, 
6.2 
years) 
from 
7 
tertiary 
care 
pediatric 
otolaryngology 
practices 
were 
enrolled. 
The 
diagnosis 
of 
obstructive 
sleep 
disorder 
was 
made 
using 
a 
combination 
of 
history, 
physical 
examination, 
nasopharyngoscopy, 
sleep 
audiotape, 
sleep 
study, 
and 
an 
orocraniofacial 
scale; 
only 
8 
children 
had 
a 
preoperative 
PSG 
study. 
Postoperative 
PSG 
data 
were 
not 
reported. 
After 
surgery, 
the 
authors 
found 
that 
88% 
of 
children 
had 
improvement 
in 
disease-specific 
QOL; 
75% 
of 
them 
had 
a 
large 
improvement, 
and 
6% 
had 
moderate 
improvement. 
Direct 
comparison 
of 
the 
QOL 
changes 
before 
and 
after 
surgery 
was 
also 
performed, 
and 
differences 
were 
highly 
significant. 


The 
second 
prospective 
QOL 
study14 
used 
the 
OSA-18 
instrument10 
and 
another 
validated 
instrument 
that 
assessed 
children’s 
behavior. 
Sixty-four 
children 
with 
sleep 
breathing 
disturbance 
underwent 
adenotonsillectomy. 
Improvements 
in 
QOL 
were 
statistically 
significant 
and 
clinically 
large, 
as 
assessed 
by 
a 
standardized 
change 
score, 
and 
behavior 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
was 
improved 
significantly. 


A 
recent 
pilot 
study 
on 
radiofrequency 
tonsil 
reduction 
in 
children 
(n=10) 
with 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
found 
that 
several 
parameters 
improved 
after 
tonsil 
reduction.13 
Improvement 
was 
noted 
at 
the 
3-month 
follow-
up 
visit 
and 
persisted 
at 
12 
months 
of 
follow-up 
on 
both 
the 
OSA-18 
instrument 
and 
a 
subjective 
daytime 
sleepiness 
score. 


To 
our 
knowledge, 
our 
study 
is 
the 
first 
to 
report 
both 
PSG 
data 
and 
disease-specific 
and 
global 
QOL 
data 
from 
the 
same 
group 
of 
patients 
who 
underwent 
adenotonsillectomy. 
In 
addition, 
we 
report 
long-term 
follow-up 
data 
1 
year 
after 
surgery. 
Our 
study 
included 
a 
representative 
sample 
of 
children 
of 
different 
ethnicity, 
body 
mass, 
and 
OSA 
severity. 
We 
had 
excellent 
follow-up 
6 
months 
after 
enrollment 
but 
poorer 
compliance 
at 
1 
year. 
The 
reasons 
for 
this 
are 
not 
entirely 
clear, 
but 
the 
1-year 
visit 
required 
a 
repeated 
sleep 
study 
and 
another 
battery 
of 
instruments. 
Many 
parents 
reported 
that 
their 
children’s 
sleep 
problems 
were 
clearly 
resolved 
and 
that 
they 
did 
not 
want 
to 
undergo 
another 
sleep 
study 
because 
the 
child 
was 
doing 
so 
well. 
A 
large 
number 
of 
instruments 
were 
used 
in 
this 
study 
(not 
all 
findings 
are 
in 
this 
report), 
and 
the 
respondent 
burden 
was 
fairly 
high. 
The 


parents 
had 
already 
completed 
a 
battery 
of 
instruments 
twice, 
so 
many 
did 
not 
want 
to 
complete 
the 
battery 
again 
at 
1 
year. 


In 
this 
study, 
we 
found 
that 
baseline 
global 
QOL 
was 
significantly 
impaired 
in 
children 
with 
sleep 
study– 
proven 
OSA. 
However, 
QOL 
was 
also 
impaired 
in 
children 
with 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
who 
did 
not 
have 
OSA 
according 
to 
PSG 
criteria. 
These 
findings 
indicate 
that 
even 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
OSA, 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
has 
a 
significant 
impact 
on 
QOL. 
In 
addition, 
we 
found 
that 
global 
and 
disease-specific 
QOL 
improved 
after 
adenotonsillectomy. 
Other 
QOL 
studies 
used 
different 
instruments, 
and 
not 
all 
children 
had 
OSA 
proven 
by 
sleep 
study.9,14 
This 
study 
confirms 
that 
when 
using 
a 
different 
validated 
instrument, 
disease-specific 
QOL 
improves 
after 
adenotonsillectomy. 
The 
improvements 
in 
QOL 
were 
seen 
6 
months 
after 
surgery 
and 
were 
sustained 
at 
1 
year. 
Even 
though 
not 
all 
children 
were 
cured 
of 
OSA 
(using 
PSG 
parameters), 
the 
improvement 
in 
QOL 
was 
nevertheless 
significant. 
This 
indicates 
that 
some 
effects 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
on 
QOL 
are 
not 
measured 
by 
the 
PSG. 


As 
expected, 
the 
largest 
improvement 
was 
in 
the 
airway 
subscale 
of 
the 
disease-specific 
instrument. 
Improvement 
in 
the 
behavior 
subscale 
was 
also 
expected. 
Interestingly, 
the 
infections 
subscale 
showed 
postoperative 
improvement. 
Although 
this 
was 
not 
anticipated 
because 
we 
did 
not 
exclude 
children 
who 
had 
a 
history 
of 
recurrent 
infections, 
it 
is 
likely 
that 
the 
improvement 
seen 
in 
the 
infections 
subscale 
was 
due 
to 
a 
reduction 
in 
infections 
after 
surgery. 
The 
overall 
magnitude 
of 
improvement 
in 
the 
airway 
subscale 
after 
surgery 
was 
quite 
large, 
whereas 
the 
magnitude 
of 
improvement 
in 
other 
sub-
scales 
was 
moderate. 
The 
magnitude 
of 
changes 
on 
the 
global 
instrument 
subscales 
was 
moderate; 
this 
finding 
is 
consistent 
with 
those 
from 
other 
outcomes 
research, 
in 
which 
global 
instruments 
are 
often 
less 
sensitive 
to 
change 
than 
disease-specific 
instruments. 


We 
also 
evaluated 
the 
associations 
between 
global 
QOL, 
disease-specific 
QOL, 
and 
PSG 
parameters. 
We 
believed 
that 
if 
we 
could 
identify 
a 
reliable 
proxy 
for 
the 
PSG 
findings, 
it 
would 
be 
clinically 
helpful 
to 
the 
practicing 
physician. 
Unfortunately, 
we 
identified 
no 
consistent 
associations, 
although 
some 
associations 
achieved 
statistical 
significance. 
Thus, 
there 
was 
some 
shared 
variance, 
but 
clearly 
much 
of 
the 
variability 
in 
each 
construct 
was 
not 
explained 
by 
variability 
in 
the 
other 
construct. 
This 
finding 
is 
fairly 
consistent 
in 
QOL 
research, 
including 
studies 
on 
adults 
with 
OSA.21-23 
There 
is 
some 
association 
between 
objective, 
hard 
measures 
and 
the 
patient’s 
subjective 
assessment, 
but 
many 
other 
factors 
are 
not 
explained 
solely 
by 
values 
from 
objective 
tests. 


Although 
we 
attempted 
to 
construct 
a 
severity 
gradient 
using 
the 
airway 
subscale, 
there 
was 
too 
much 
variability 
between 
patients 
to 
use 
the 
subscale 
score 
as 
a 
predictor 
of 
PSG 
findings. 
This 
finding 
tells 
us 
that 
PSG 
data 
and 
QOL 
data 
are 
related 
but 
complementary 
and 
that 
they 
assess 
different 
but 
associated 
constructs. 
Whereas 
children 
with 
more 
severe 
apnea 
tended 
to 
have 
higher 
airway 
subscale 
scores, 
much 
of 
the 
variability 
in 
QOL 
was 
not 
explained 
by 
apnea 
severity.

CONCLUSIONSCONCLUSIONS
In 
summary, 
children 
with 
OSA 
treated 
with 
adenotonsillectomy 
demonstrated 
large 
and 
sustained 
improvements 
in 
QOL, 
both 
on 
disease-specific 
and 
global 
QOL 
instruments. 
In 
addition, 
there 
were 
marked 
improvements 
in 
PSG 
findings 
after 
surgery. 
Although 
these 
changes 
in 
QOL 
were 
associated 
with 
improvements 
in 
PSG 
findings, 
the 
association 
between 
QOL 
and 
PSG 
findings 
was 
only
