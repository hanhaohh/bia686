Objective: 
To 
evaluate 
the 
safety 
and 
efficacy 
of 
temperature-
controlled 
radiofrequency 
tonsil 
reduction 
in 
the 
treatment 
of 
children 
with 
a 
sleep-related 
breathing 
disorder 
associated 
with 
tonsillar 
obstructive 
hypertrophy. 


Design: 
Prospective, 
nonrandomized, 
case 
series 
feasibility 
study 
of 
children 
meeting 
the 
criteria 
for 
tonsillectomy 
or 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
the 
treatment 
of 
an 
obstructive 
sleep-related 
breathing 
disorder. 


Setting: 
Community-based 
hospital. 


Patients: 
Ten 
children, 
aged 
4 
to 
13 
years, 
presenting 
consecutively 
to 
a 
community-based 
otolaryngology 
practice 
with 
tonsillar 
or 
adenotonsillar 
obstructive 
hypertrophy 
implicated 
clinically 
in 
causing 
a 
sleep-related 
breathing 
disorder; 
their 
parents 
consenting 
to 
temperature-
controlled 
radiofrequency 
tonsil 
reduction 
instead 
of 
surgical 
tonsillectomy. 


Intervention: 
Temperature-controlled 
radiofrequency 
tonsil 
reduction, 
along 
with 
surgical 
adenoidectomy, 
if 
adenoids 
were 
present, 
under 
general 
anesthesia. 


Main 
Outcome 
Measures: 
Tonsil 
size 
reduction, 
treatment 
morbidity, 
and 
symptom 
improvement 
with 
follow-
up 
to 
1 
year. 
Baseline 
and 
3-month 
posttreatment 
polysomnographic 
data 
were 
used. 


Results: 
There 
was 
a 
reduction 
in 
tonsil 
size 
at 
1 
year 
of 
75.0% 
on 
average, 
without 
evidence 
of 
regrowth 
during 
the 
1-year 
follow-up. 
All 
children 
were 
drinking 
liquids 
in 
the 
recovery 
room, 
and 
most 
were 
eating 
soft 
diets 
within 
6 
hours; 
8 
of 
the 
10 
children 
were 
eating 
a 
normal 
diet 
by 
day 
5. 
On 
average, 
the 
return 
to 
normal 
activity 
was 
3.9 
days, 
with 
2.9 
days 
of 
parental 
loss 
of 
work 
time. 
Quality-of-life 
variables 
all 
improved. 
Snore 
indexes 
decreased 
by 
88.6%. 
Polysomnography 
at 
3 
months 
revealed 
an 
84.2% 
reduction 
in 
the 
apnea 
index 
and 
a 
52.3% 
reduction 
in 
the 
apnea/hypopnea 
index. 
There 
were 
no 
complications. 


Conclusion: 
Temperature-controlled 
radiofrequency 
tonsil 
reduction 
seems 
to 
be 
a 
safe, 
effective, 
and 
minimally 
morbid 
treatment 
for 
tonsil 
hypertrophy 
in 
children 
with 
obstructive 
sleep-related 
breathing 
disorders.

HEN 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy 
is 
implicated 
in 
pediatric 
sleep-related 
breathing 
disorders 
(SRBDs), 
surgical 
tonsillectomy 
and 
adenoidectomy 
(T&A) 
is 
usually 
the 
recommended 
treatment. 
Of 
the 
pediatric 
T&As 
performed 
in 
this 
country 
yearly, 
about 
80% 
are 
performed 
for 
obstruction 
rather 
than 
infection.1 
Although 
standard 
surgical 
T&A 
is 
certainly 
effective, 
the 
trade-off 
is 
usually 
significant 
postoperative 
morbidity. 
Those 
who 
take 
care 
of 
children 
are 
familiar 
with 
the 
associated 
postoperative 
pain, 
causing 
dehydration 
and 
weight 
loss; 
the 
risks 
of 
bleeding 
and 
infection; 
the 
adverse 
effects 
of 
prolonged 
narcotic 
use; 
and 
the 
loss 
of 
productive 
time 
for 
parents. 
For 
the 
most 
part, 


these 
problems 
are 
due 
to 
the 
tonsillectomy, 
rather 
than 
the 
adenoidectomy, 
portion 
of 
this 
procedure. 


Temperature-controlled 
radiofrequency 
(TCRF), 
a 
technology 
known 
commercially 
as 
Somnoplasty 
(Gyrus 
ENT, 
LLC), 
has 
been 
shown 
to 
reduce 
enlarged 
obstructive 
tonsils 
in 
adults, 
without 
the 
significant 
pain 
and 
other 
morbidity 
of 
tonsillectomy 
or 
other 
types 
of 
tonsillotomy.2 
Adult 
tonsil 
size 
was 
reduced, 
on 
average, 
by 
70%,

lesion. 
This 
lesion 
is 
then 
gradually 
resorbed 
by 
the 
body, 
thus 
shrinking 
tissue 
volume 
while 
leaving 
the 
overlying 
mucous 
membrane 
intact. 
Intact 
mucosa 
accounts 
for 
the 
minimal 
discomfort, 
the 
reduced 
risk 
of 
bleeding 
and 
infection, 
and 
the 
faster 
return 
to 
normal 
diet 
and 
activity. 


The 
electrode 
for 
tonsil 
reduction 
is 
designed 
with 
a 
penetrator 
template 
and 
blunt 
insulated 
tips 
to 
avoid 
penetration 
of 
the 
underlying 
tonsil 
capsule 
and 
risk 
to 
the 
surrounding 
vasculature. 
By 
using 
this 
electrode, 
multiple 
lesions 
are 
then 
created 
submucosally 
in 
the 
tonsil 
stroma 
(Figure 
1). 


To 
see 
if 
TCRF 
technology 
could 
yield 
similar 
results 
safely 
and 
effectively 
in 
a 
pediatric 
population, 
as 
it 
has 
for 
adults, 
the 
following 
feasibility 
study 
was 
undertaken. 


METHODS
The 
study 
(approved 
by 
the 
Institutional 
Review 
Committee 
of 
Good 
Samaritan 
Hospital, 
San 
Jose) 
was 
designed 
as 
a 
non-
randomized 
prospective 
examination 
of 
the 
first 
10 
children 
older 
than 
3 
years 
presenting 
to 
my 
community-based 
otolaryngology 
practice 
with 
symptoms 
of 
an 
SRBD 
and 
clinically 
enlarged 
tonsils 
who 
met 
the 
protocol 
criteria. 
The 
criteria 
for 
selection 
were 
enlarged 
tonsils 
(at 
least 
3+ 
on 
a 
1+ 
to 
4+ 
clinical 
scale), 
along 
with 
suggestive 
symptoms 
of 
an 
SRBD 
such 
as 
loud 
night 
snoring, 
daytime 
sleepiness, 
a 
fitful 
sleep 
pattern, 
witnessed 
gasping, 
or 
apnea 
events. 
Tonsil 
size 
was 
graded 
on 
clinical 
examination 
by 
the 
treating 
physician 
(L.M.N.), 
where 
1+ 
indicates 
tonsils 
well 
within 
the 
fossa; 
2+, 
extension 
to, 
and 
obscured 
visualization 
of, 
the 
posterior 
pillar; 
3+, 
the 
tonsil 
is 
beyond 
the 
posterior 
pillar 
but 
not 
to 
the 
midline; 
and 
4+, 
extension 
to 
the 
midline. 
Patients 
selected 
had 
similar 
histories 
and 
clinical 
findings 
as 
those 
who 
would 
ordinarily 
be 
candidates 
for 
surgical 
T&A 
in 
my 
practice, 
and 
their 
parents 
consented 
to 
TCRF 
tonsil 
reduction 
instead 
of 
surgical 
tonsillectomy. 
The 
10 
children 
selected 
(7 
boys 
and 
3 
girls), 
aged 
4 
to 
13 
years, 
underwent 
baseline 
12-lead 
polysomnography 
using 
one 
sleep 
center, 
confirming 
an 
SRBD. 


Temperature-controlled 
radiofrequency 
tonsil 
reduction 
was 
performed 
under 
general 
anesthesia, 
with 
either 
endotracheal 
intubation 
or 
a 
laryngeal 
mask 
airway. 
All 
procedures 
were 
performed 
by 
the 
same 
otolaryngologist 
(L.M.N.) 
at 
Good 
Samaritan 
Hospital. 
Oropharyngeal 
exposure 
was 
obtained 
with 
a 
pediatric 
Crowe 
slotted 
ring 
retractor 
with 
the 
patient 
in 
a 
Rose 
T&A 
position. 
Tonsil 
pillar 
plane 
injections 
with 
medialization 
of 
the 
tonsil 
were 
then 
performed 
with 
0.25% 
bupivacaine 
hydrochloride 
and 
1:200000 
epinephrine 
(on 
average, 
3.5 
mL 
per 
tonsil). 
As 
illustrated 
in 
Figure 
1, 
multiple 
TCRF 
lesions 
were 
then 
formed 
submucosally 
using 
dual 
blunt 
electrodes 
deployed 
through 
an 
insulated 
penetrator 
template 
device 
(TCRF 
tonsil 
model 
2420 
handpiece). 
Each 
set 
of 
lesions 
(average, 
7.5 
per 
tonsil) 
was 
placed 
approximately 
1 
cm 
apart 
over 
the 
medial 
face 
of 
the 
tonsil 
(electrodes 
were 
placed 
medial 
to 
lateral 
through 
the 
tonsil 
stroma) 
and 
was 
preceded 
by 
intratonsillar 
injection 
of 
isotonic 
sodium 
chloride 
solution 
(average, 
6 
mL 
per 
tonsil). 
Sets 
(4-9) 
of 
lesions 
(8-18 
ablative 
lesions) 
were 
developed 
in 
each 
tonsil, 
depending 
on 
tonsil 
size. 


Lesions 
were 
developed 
with 
a 
TCRF 
generator 
(Somnus 
S2; 
Gyrus 
ENT, 
LLC), 
set 
at 
85°C, 
1000 
J 
(500 
J 
per 
individual 
lesion 
on 
dual-electrode 
mode), 
and 
a 
maximum 
of 
15 
W 
of 
power. 
An 
adenoidectomy 
(in 
8 
of 
the 
10 
children, 
with 
2 
having 
undergone 
prior 
adenoidectomies) 
was 
performed 
concurrently 
with 
a 
surgical 
curette 
and 
electrocautery 
hemostasis. 
Patients 
were 
given 
perioperative 
and 
postoperative 
corticosteroids 
(intravenous 
dexamethasone, 
0.5 
mg/kg 
of 
body 
weight 
up 
to 
6 
mg, 
at 
surgery, 
and 
half 
that 
dose 
6 
hours 
later) 
and 
antibiotics 
(oral 
amoxicillin, 
40 
mg/kg 
per 
day, 
starting 
3 
days 
before 
surgery 
and 
continued 
for 
7 
days 
after 
surgery), 
and 
underwent 
short-stay 
oximetry-monitored 
observation 
(23 
hours) 
in 
the 
hospital. 


The 
postoperative 
variables 
(for 
days 
0-14) 
followed 
were 
pain 
levels 
(visual 
analog 
scale 
[VAS] 
score, 
scored 
by 
patients 
and 
their 
parents), 
oral 
intake, 
clinical 
assessment 
of 
tissue 
swelling 
and 
any 
complications, 
and 
loss 
of 
parental 
work 
time 
due 
to 
the 
child’s 
convalescence. 
Longer-term 
variables 
observed 
were 
tonsil 
size 
(1+ 
to 
4+ 
clinical 
scale), 
SRBD 
and 
other 
obstructive 
symptoms

by 
the

assessed 
at 
1, 
3, 
6, 
and 
12 
months. 
The 
Obstructive 
Sleep 
Apnea-18 
questionnaire 
is 
a 
validated 
health-related 
qualityof-
life 
survey. 
The 
survey 
consists 
of 
18 
questions 
divided 
into 
5 
domains. 
Domains 
represented 
in 
the 
survey 
are 
sleep 
disturbance, 
physical 
symptoms, 
emotional 
symptoms, 
daytime 
functions, 
and 
caregiver 
concerns.4 
Polysomnography 
(performed 
at 
the 
same 
sleep 
laboratory 
that 
performed 
the 
baseline 
recording) 
was 
repeated 
at 
3 
months 
posttreatment. 


Unless 
otherwise 
specified, 
data 
are 
presented 
as 
means±SDs. 
Comparative 
pretreatment 
and 
posttreatment 
mean 
values 
were 
evaluated 
for 
statistical 
significance 
using 
the 
paired 
t 
test. 
Statistical 
significance 
was 
accepted 
when 
P.05. 


RESULTS
On 
average, 
blood 
loss 
for 
the 
concomitant 
adenoidectomy 
was 
12±4 
mL 
(n=8). 
There 
was 
no 
measurable 
blood 
loss 
for 
the 
TCRF 
tonsil 
reductions 
(estimated 
as 


1 
mL 
by 
observation 
of 
sponges 
and 
micropediatric 
suction 
canister). 
As 
a 
consequence, 
anesthesia 
by 
laryngeal 
mask 
airway 
was 
considered 
safe, 
and 
was 
used 
on 
3 
patients 
without 
complication. 
The 
equipment 
charge 
per 
case 
included 
the 
cost 
of 
a 
“cold 
instrument” 
setup, 
identical 
to 
that 
needed 
for 
surgical 
T&A, 
plus 
a 
$350 
disposable 
TCRF 
handpiece. 
The 
operative 
time 
for 
TCRF 
tonsil 
reduction 
is 
a 
function 
of 
the 
number 
of 
lesions 
created. 
Typically, 
the 
number 
of 
lesions 
needed 
to 
cause 
adequate 
tissue 
reduction 
seems 
to 
be 
12 
to 
18 
(6-9 
dual-electrode 
placements) 
per 
tonsil. 
The 
operative 
time 
(surgical 
exposure 
and 
treatment 
of 
both 
tonsils, 
excluding 
adenoidectomy) 
was 
28.5±4.7 
minutes 
(n=8). 
Surgical 
adenoidectomy 
added 
an 
additional 
5.5±2.0 
minutes 
(n=8). 


All 
10 
children 
were 
drinking 
liquids 
in 
the 
recovery 
room 
and 
eating 
soft 
solids 
within 
the 
first 
day, 
most 
(7 
of 
the 
10 
children) 
within 
6 
hours 
of 
surgery. 
Sustainable 
oral 
hydration 
was 
achieved 
by 
all 
within 
the 
first 
24 
hours. 
Of 
the 
10 
children, 
8 
were 
eating 
a 
normal 
diet 
by 
day 
5 
(range, 
1-7 
days), 
and 
the 
group 
returned 
to 
normal 
activity 
in 
3.9±2.1 
days. 
Initially, 
patients 
had 
moderate 
throat 
pain, 
diminishing 
during 
the 
first 
week. 
The 
average 
parent-rated 
VAS 
pain 
score 
was 
4.5 
on 
day 
1, 


2.9 
on 
day 
4, 
and 
0.8 
on 
day 
7. 
The 
average 
child-rated 
VAS 
pain 
score 
was 
5.1 
on 
day 
1, 
3.1 
on 
day 
4, 
and 
1.1 
on 
day 
7. 
Parents 
lost 
2.9±1.8 
working 
days. 
Although 
all 
patients 
developed 
temporary 
peritonsillar 
edema 
and 
punctate 
mucosal 
slough 
at 
electrode 
placement 
sites, 
there 
were 
no 
postoperative 
treatment 
complications, 
including 
clinically 
significant 
airway 
obstruction 
or 
bleeding. 


Tonsil 
size 
reduction 
was 
progressive 
following 
TCRF 
treatment, 
with 
discernible 
reduction 
noted 
clinically 
by 
2 
weeks 
and 
continued 
reduction 
to 
6 
to 
8 
weeks 
posttreatment. 
One 
child 
(patient 
008) 
was 
lost 
to 
follow-
up 
after 
1 
month. 
For 
the 
remaining 
9 
children, 
a 
comparison 
at 
3 
months 
demonstrates 
a 
statistically 
significant 
reduction 
in 
tonsil 
size 
from 
a 
baseline 
of 
3.2±0.6 
to 
1.1±0.7 
(unit 
of 
measure 
is 
the 
clinical 
1+ 
to

COMMENT
This 
pilot 
study 
was 
undertaken 
to 
test 
the 
feasibility 
of 
using 
TCRF 
tonsil 
reduction 
as 
an 
alternative 
to 
other 
tonsillar 
procedures 
in 
the 
treatment 
of 
pediatric 
obstructive 
SRBDs 
associated 
with 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy. 
The 
study 
demonstrates 
definite 
advantages 
and 
disadvantages 
vs 
existing 
tonsillectomy 
procedures 
and 
capsule-sparing 
excisional 
tonsillotomies. 
The 
minimally 
invasive 
mucosa-sparing 
aspects 
of 
TCRF 
seem 
to 
reduce 
postoperative 
pain. 
The 
VAS 
pain 
levels 
in 
this 
study, 
as 
reported 
by 
the 
study 
subjects, 
were 
5.1 
and 


1.1 
on 
posttreatment 
days 
1 
and 
7, 
respectively. 
Using 
a 
similar 
method, 
Warnock 
and 
Lander5 
reported 
pain 
levels 
of 
6.5 
and 
2.7 
on 
days 
1 
and 
7, 
respectively, 
following 
pediatric 
surgical 
tonsillectomy 
or 
T&A. 
The 
prevalence 
of 
dehydration 
and 
weight 
loss 
following 
surgical 
tonsillectomy 
has 
been 
correlated 
with 
the 
level 
of 
pain 
intensity.6,7 
There 
also 
seems 
to 
be 
a 
direct 
relationship 
between 
pain 
intensity 
toward 
the 
end 
of 
postoperative 
week 
1 
following 
pediatric 
surgical 
tonsillectomy 
or 
T&A 
and 
the 
number 
of 
unscheduled 
physician’s 
office 
and 
emergency 
department 
visits.5 
A 
more 
rapid 
return 
to 
a 
normal 
diet 
and 
activity 
for 
the 
child 
seems 
to 
equate 
with 
less 
work 
time 
loss 
for 
parents, 
3 
days 
in 
this 
study 
instead 
of 
the 
7 
days 
reported 
in 
the 
literature.8 
The 
operative 
blood 
loss 
for 
TCRF 
tonsil 
reduction 
is 
estimated 
as 
less 
than 
1 
mL. 
Blood 
loss 
for 
monopolar 
electrosurgical 
tonsil 
resection 
and 
plasma-mediated 
tonsil 
ablation 
in 
children 
has 
been 
reported 
as 
83.8 
and 
90.9 
mL, 
respectively.9 
Given 
the 
minimal 
blood 
loss 
with 
TCRF 
tonsil 
reduction, 
less 
stringent 
precautions 
for 
airway 
protection 
seem 
reasonable 
and 
the 
less 
invasive 
laryngeal 
mask 
airway 
seems 
to 
be 
a 
safe 
alternative 
to 
endotracheal 
intubation. 


In 
addition 
to 
safety, 
this 
pilot 
study 
was 
undertaken 
to 
ascertain 
preliminary 
information 
as 
to 
how 
many 
energy 
would 
be 
needed 
with 
this 
technique 
to 
adequately 
reduce 
a 
child’s 
tonsil 
for 
SRBD 
control. 
Therefore, 
the 
first 
child 
to 
undergo 
this 
procedure 
in 
the 
study 
received 
a 
fairly 
conservative 
4000 
J 
per 
tonsil. 
This 
proved 
safe, 
with 
minimal 
postoperative 
morbidity, 
but 
resulted 
in 
a 
subsequent 
reduction 
in 
tonsil 
size 
of 
only 
25% 
on 
the 
left 
side 
and 
0% 
on 
the 
right 
side 
by 
3 
months, 
unchanged 
at 
the 
6-month 
follow-up. 
At 
the 
request 
of 
his 
parents, 
this 
child 
was 
treated 
a 
second 
time 
(the 
only 
one 
in 
the 
study 
to 
be 
treated 
more 
than 
once), 
further 
reducing 
tonsil 
size 
by 
75% 
on 
the 
left 
side 
and 
66% 
on 
the 
right 
side 
in 
total. 
Impressed 
by 
the 
first 
patient’s 
minimal 
postoperative 


morbidity, 
the 
remaining 
children 
were 
given 
an 
average 
of 
7510.5 
J 
per 
tonsil, 
reducing 
their 
tonsils 
by 
75% 
on 
average 
with 
a 
single 
treatment. 


All 
the 
children 
in 
this 
limited 
case 
series 
showed 
a 
significant 
improvement 
in 
airway 
obstructive 
symptoms 
and 
signs. 
What 
proportion 
of 
this 
improvement 
was 
due 
to 
the 
adenoidectomy 
or 
tonsil 
reduction 
alone 
is 
not 
known, 
and 
the 
study 
was 
not 
designed 
to 
investigate 
this 
issue. 
However, 
the 
usual 
community 
practice 
for 
the 
treatment 
of 
pediatric 
SRBDs 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
adenoid 
and 
tonsil 
enlargement 
is 
to 
address 
both 
areas 
simultaneously. 
This 
study 
investigated 
whether 
TCRF 
tonsil 
reduction 
could 
be 
effectively 
substituted 
for 
more 
invasive 
excisional 
tonsil 
procedures 
in 
the 
treatment 
of 
pediatric 
SRBDs 
without 
compromising 
outcomes. 
The 
improvements 
in 
symptoms 
and 
clinical 
findings 
seem 
to 
indicate 
that 
it 
can. 
Despite 
the 
fact 
that 
some 
tonsillar 
tissue 
remains 
following 
TCRF, 
this 
limited 
series 
shows 
no 
regrowth 
during 
the 
1-year 
follow-up. 


This 
study 
highlights 
certain 
shortcomings 
of 
TCRF 
in 
its 
present 
design 
for 
tonsil 
reduction. 
Radiofrequency 
tissue 
ablation 
of 
any 
type 
produces 
a 
thermal 
injury 
with 
acute 
inflammatory 
tissue 
edema. 
Based 
on 
observations 
in 
this 
study, 
the 
acute 
peritonsillar 
tissue 
swelling 
in 
children 
seems 
to 
become 
clinically 
apparent 
about 
4 
to 
6 
hours 
postoperatively, 
peaking 
at 
about 
12 
to 
18 
hours 
and 
significantly 
diminishing 
during 
the 
next 
12 
to 
24 
hours. 
Although 
no 
child 
in 
this 
study 
showed 
evidence 
of 
acute 
airway 
obstructive 
signs 
or 
symptoms, 
such 
as 
stridor, 
dyspnea, 
or 
measured 
oxygen 
desaturation, 
for 
the 
child 
who 
starts 
with 
an 
already 
compromised 
oropharyngeal 
airway 
(tonsil 
size 
3+ 
or 
4+), 
short-stay 
hospital 
observation 
becomes 
warranted, 
at 
least 
for 
the 
first 
18 
hours. 
Alternatives, 
such 
as 
treating 
one 
tonsil 
at 
a 
time 
or 
giving 
less 
energy 
so 
that 
the 
procedure 
becomes 
“staged,” 
are 
not 
practical 
given 
the 
need 
for 
a 
general 
anesthetic 
in 
a 
pediatric 
population. 


The 
operative 
time 
for 
TCRF 
tonsil 
reduction 


(28.5 
minutes 
in 
this 
study) 
is 
generally 
greater 
compared, 
for 
example, 
with 
the 
16.2 
minutes 
reported 
for 
monopolar 
electrosurgical 
tonsillectomy 
and 
the 
23.8 
minutes 
reported 
for 
plasma-mediated 
ablation 
tonsillectomy.
9 
There 
is 
an 
additional 
charge 
for 
the 
disposable 
TCRF 
handpiece. 
How 
the 
additional 
initial 
expenses 
for 
added 
operative 
time 
and 
instrumentation 
compare 
with 
the 
overall 
expenses 
incurred 
for 
loss 
of 
parental 
work 
time 
and 
readmission 
for 
bleeding 
and 
dehydration 
that 
can 
be 
associated 
with 
surgical 
tonsillectomy 
have 
yet 
to 
be 
studied. 
The 
volume 
of 
tonsil 
tissue 
reduction 
with 
TCRF 
does 
not 
seem 
to 
be 
uniform 
between 
patients 
despite 
similar 
energy 
inputs 
as 
adjusted 
by 
tonsil 
size. 
Because 
tonsil 
volume 
reduction 
is 
a 
gradual 
process 
for 
6 
to 
8 
weeks 
following 
TCRF, 
a 
decision 
at 
surgery 
as 
to 
how 
much 
tissue 
reduction 
will 
actually 
result 
cannot 
be 
made. 
In 
an 
adult 
population 
in 
whom 
TCRF 
tonsil 
reduction 
can 
be 
an 
in-office 
procedure 
under 
local 
anesthesia, 
repeated 
treatments, 
if 
needed, 
are 
not 
as 
significant 
an 
issue. 
However, 
for 
children, 
the 
need 
for 
a 
general 
anesthetic 
in 
an 
operating 
room 
makes 
this 
approach 
impractical.

mate 
of 
actual 
tissue 
volume 
reduction 
is 
obviously 
desirable, 
all 
children 
in 
this 
study 
(with 
the 
exception 
of 
the 
first 
one, 
who 
received 
less 
energy 
by 
design) 
attained 
enough 
ablation 
to 
resolve 
the 
tonsillar 
component 
of 
obstruction. 
Solutions 
for 
some 
of 
these 
issues 
may 
be 
forthcoming 
as 
we 
gain 
more 
experience 
with 
this 
procedure. 


In 
conclusion, 
TCRF 
tonsil 
reduction 
seems 
to 
be 
a 
safe 
and 
effective 
way 
of 
treating 
enlarged 
tonsils 
in 
children, 
with 
results 
maintained 
during 
1 
year 
of 
follow-up. 
Despite 
the 
need 
for 
better 
outcome 
prediction 
and 
posttreatment 
edema 
control, 
the 
relatively 
minimal 
postoperative 
morbidity 
incurred 
with 
this 
technique 
could 
make 
it 
an 
attractive 
alternative 
to 
the 
surgical 
tonsillectomy 
portion 
when 
T&A 
is 
indicated 
in 
the 
treatment 
of 
an 
SRBD 
and 
airway 
obstruction. 
Validation 
of 
these 
preliminary 
findings 
awaits 
the 
results 
of 
a 
larger,
