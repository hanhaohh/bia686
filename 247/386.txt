Background 
and 
objectives: 
There 
are 
limited 
data 
on 
the 
night-to-night 
variability 
of 
childhood 
sleep-related 
disordered 
breathing 
(SDB). 
We 
aim 
to 
assess 
for 
the 
presence 
of 
first-night 
effect 
(FNE) 
and 
to 
examine 
whether 
a 
single-night 
sleep 
study 
is 
adequate 
in 
the 
assessment 
of 
childhood 
SDB. 
Design: 
In 
a 
case-control 
study 
investigating 
whether 
obesity 
is 
a 
risk 
factor 
for 
childhood 
SDB, 
the 
night-to-night 
variability 
of 
sleep 
and 
respiratory 
variables 
were 
studied. 
Participants 
and 
setting: 
Forty-six 
obese 
children 
from 
a 
pediatric 
obesity 
clinic 
and 
44 
age-and 
sex-matched 
normal 
weight 
control 
subjects 
from 
local 
schools. 
Interventions: 
All 
subjects 
underwent 
two 
consecutive 
overnight 
polysomnographic 
studies. 
An 
obstructive 
apnea 
index 
(OAI) 
> 
1/h 
was 
considered 
diagnostic 
of 
SDB. 
Results: 
The 
mean 
age 
of 
the 
children 
was 
11.21 
years 
(SD 
2.21). 
Forty-four 
obese 
children 
and 
43 
control 
subjects 
completed 
the 
2-night 
study. 
Based 
on 
the 
criterion 
of 
the 
worst 
OAI 
over 
the 
2 
nights, 
13 
subjects 
were 
found 
to 
have 
SDB, 
12 
subjects 
were 
primary 
snorers, 
and 
62 
were 
normal 
subjects. 
In 
all 
subjects, 
the 
sleep 
efficiency 
improved 
and 
sleep-onset 
latency 
was 
reduced 
on 
the 
second 
night. 
While 
there 
was 
a 
rebound 
of 
rapid 
eye 
movement 
sleep 
with 
the 
associated 
worsening 
of 
respiratory 
indexes 
(mainly 
accounted 
for 
by 
an 
increase 
in 
central 
apneas 
and 
hypopneas) 
evident 
in 
normal 
subjects, 
there 
was 
a 
significant 
improvement 
of 
respiratory 
disturbances 
in 
the 
SDB 
group 
on 
the 
second 
night. 
The 
first-night 
polysomnography 
would 
have 
correctly 
identified 
84.6% 
of 
cases 
as 
defined 
by 
the 
criteria 
of 
the 
worst 
OAI 
over 
the 
2 
nights. 
All 
cases 
missed 
by 
the 
first-night 
study 
had 
only 
borderline 
OAI. 
Conclusions: 
The 
phenomenon 
of 
FNE 
in 
children 
was 
well 
demonstrated 
in 
our 
study. 
We 
proposed 
that 
a 
single-night 
sleep 
study 
is 
adequate 
and 
more 
cost-effective 
in 
assessing 
for 
childhood 
SDB.

of 
a 
single-night 
study.11–14 
The 
FNE 
is 
known 
to 
reduce 
the 
amount 
of 
rapid 
eye 
movement 
(REM) 
sleep; 
with 
childhood 
SDB 
being 
more 
severe 
during 
REM 
sleep, 
single-
night 
polysomnography 
may 
be 
expected 
to 
generate 
a 
high 
rate 
of 
false-negative 
findings. 
The 
aim 
of 
this 
study 
was 
to 
assess 
the 
night-to-night 
variability 
of 
sleep 
architecture, 
and 
the 
presence 
and 
severity 
of 
SDB 
in 
children 
as 
measured 
by 
polysomnography 
performed 
on 
2 
consecutive 
nights. 
This 
would 
provide 
important 
data 
on 
the 
feasibility 
of 
a 
single-
night 
study 
in 
the 
assessment 
of 
SDB 
in 
children. 


Materials 
and 
Methods 


Subject 
Selection 


From 
1998 
to 
1999, 
we 
recruited 
consecutive 
children 
aged 
7 
to 
15 
years 
from 
the 
pediatric 
obesity 
clinic 
at 
our 
university 
hospital. 
They 
were 
all 
referrals 
from 
primary 
care 
physicians 
for 
healthy 
living 
and 
dietary 
advice. 
Normal 
weight-, 
age-, 
and 
sex-matched 
control 
subjects 
were 
randomly 
selected 
from 
local 
schools. 
Children 
with 
known 
clinical 
syndromes 
such 
as 
Down 
syndrome 
and 
Prader-Willi 
syndrome, 
neuromuscular 
disease, 
laryngomalacia, 
or 
upper 
airway 
surgery 
were 
excluded. 
Obese 
children 
were 
defined 
as 
those 
with 
actual 
weights 
. 
120% 
of 
the 
ideal 
weight 
for 
height, 
whereas 
normal-weight 
control 
subjects 
had 
an 
ideal 
weight 
for 
height 
from 
80 
to 
120%.15 
A 
detailed 
description 
of 
the 
methodology 
can 
be 
found 
in 
our 
previous 
publication.16 
The 
university 
ethics 
committee 
approved 
the 
study, 
and 
all 
the 
subjects 
and 
their 
parents 
gave 
written 
informed 
consent. 


Physical 
Examination 
and 
Sleep 
Questionnaires 


All 
children 
and 
their 
parents 
completed 
a 
questionnaire 
pertaining 
to 
symptoms 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
as 
well 
as 
sleep 
habits 
and 
other 
sleep 
disorders. 
The 
height 
and 
weight 
of 
each 
child 
were 
measured 
by 
the 
standard 
standiometer 
and 
the 
digital 
floor 
scale 
(Detector 
model 
6029; 
SECA; 
Hamburg, 
Germany), 
respectively. 


Polysomnography 
and 
Main 
Respiratory 
Outcome 
Measures 


All 
children 
underwent 
two 
consecutive 
standard 
overnight 
polysomnographic 
studies 
to 
be 
followed 
by 
a 
daytime 
multiple 
sleep 
latency 
test 
at 
the 
third 
day 
with 
a 
CNS 
1000P 
polygraph 
(CNS; 
Chanhassen, 
MN). 
For 
a 
detailed 
description 
of 
the 
standard 
polysomnography 
procedure 
and 
scoring 
criteria 
for 
the 
respiratory 
disturbances, 
please 
refer 
to 
our 
previous 
article.16 
Briefly, 
standard 
overnight 
polysomnography 
recorded 
the 
following 
parameters: 
EEG, 
electro-oculogram, 
electromyogram 
of 


mentalis 
activity 
and 
bilateral 
anterior 
tibialis, 
and 
respiratory 
movements 
of 
the 
rib 
cage 
and 
abdomen. 
The 
position 
of 
the 
subject, 
respiratory 
airflow 
(thermistor 
signals), 
arterial 
oxyhemoglobin 
saturation, 
and 
end-tidal 
carbon 
dioxide 
(ETCO2) 
were 
also 
measured. 
All 
computerized 
sleep 
data 
were 
further 
visually 
edited. 
The 
terminology 
and 
main 
scoring 
criteria 
for 
the 
respiratory 
outcomes 
were 
reported 
previously, 
and 
closely 
followed 
the 
recommendation 
of 
American 
Thoracic 
Society 
on 
the 
polysomnography 
scoring.1,16 
Briefly, 
obstructive 
apnea 
was 
defined 
as 
absence 
of 
airflow 
with 
persistent 
respiratory 
effort 
lasting 
longer 
than 
two 
baseline 
breaths, 
irrespective 
of 
arterial 
oxyhemoglobin 
saturation 
changes. 
Central 
apnea 
was 
defined 
as 
absence 
of 
respiratory 
effort 
associated 
with 
absence 
of 
airflow. 
Those 
of 
. 
20 
s 
with 
or 
without 
oxygen 
desaturation, 
and 
those 
of 
any 
duration 
but 
associated 
with 
oxygen 
desaturation 
of 
at 
least 
4% 
were 
quantified. 
The 
oxygen 
desaturation 
index 
(ODI) 
was 
defined 
as 
the 
total 
number 
of 
dips 
in 
arterial 
oxygen 
saturation 


. 
4% 
per 
hour 
of 
sleep. 
The 
apnea-hypopnea 
index 
(AHI) 
is 
the 
total 
number 
of 
apneas 
and 
hypopneas 
per 
hour 
of 
actual 
sleep 
time. 
The 
obstructive 
apnea 
index 
(OAI) 
was 
defined 
as 
the 
total 
number 
of 
obstructive 
apneas 
per 
hour 
of 
actual 
sleep 
time. 
The 
controversy 
of 
the 
diagnostic 
criterion 
for 
childhood 
SDB 
has 
been 
discussed.5–7 
As 
there 
is 
no 
widely 
accepted 
diagnostic 
criterion 
for 
classic 
SDB 
in 
children, 
we 
chose 
a 
more 
conventional 
and 
well-accepted 
criterion, 
OAI 
. 
1, 
as 
the 
diagnostic 
cut-off 
of 
SDB 
in 
the 
current 
study. 
The 
concept 
of 
childhood 
SDB 
is 
quickly 
evolving, 
and 
is 
often 
seen 
as 
a 
spectrum 
from 
normal 
upper 
airway 
to 
resistance 
and 
obstruction.7 
However, 
controversies 
existed 
on 
the 
diagnostic 
concept 
and 
standard 
of 
upper 
airway 
resistance 
syndrome 
(UARS) 
in 
children.7 
The 
2002 
American 
Academy 
of 
Pediatrics 
Clinical 
practice 
guideline 
for 
diagnosis 
and 
management 
of 
childhood 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
did 
not 
explicitly 
acknowledge 
the 
existence 
of 
UARS 
and 
the 
differentiation 
of 
UARS 
from 
primary 
snoring.5–7 
In 
view 
of 
the 
controversy 
and 
lack 
of 
a 
standard 
guideline, 
we 
did 
not 
further 
differentiate 
UARS 
from 
primary 
snoring 
in 
the 
current 
study. 
We 
classified 
an 
individual 
with 
a 
normal 
OAI 
but 
with 
nocturnal 
snoring 
for 
. 
4 
nights 
per 
week

Statistical 
Analysis 


The 
statistical

was 
performed 
by 
using 
SPSS

significantly 
on

The 
phenomenon 
of 
REM 
sleep 
rebound 
was 
evident 
on 
the 
second 
night 
only 
in 
the 
normal 
control 
subjects. 
There 
was 
no 
significant 
difference 
in 
respiratory 
indexes 
over 
the 
2 
nights 
among 
the 
primary 
snorers. 
There 
was, 
however, 
statistically 
significant 
increase 
in 
AHI 
and 
hypopnea 
index 
in 
the 
normal 
control 
subjects, 
accountable 
for 
by 
mainly 
an 
increase 
in 
central 
respiratory 
disturbances 
(for 
example, 
central 
apnea 
index 
increased 
from 
0.24 
(SD 
0.36) 
to 
0.36 
(SD 
0.4), 
p 
0.005) 
[Table 
7]. 


The 
first-night 
polysomnography 
would 
have 
correctly 
identified 
11 
of 
the 
13 
cases 
(84.6%) 
if 
the 
worst 
OAI 
over 
any 
single 
night 
was 
used 
as 
the 
criterion 
(0.9). 
The 
cases 
missed 
by 
the 
single 
first-night 
polysomnography 
had 
only 
borderline 
OAI.

demonstrated. 
A 
single-night 
sleep 
study 
would 
have 
correctly 
identified 
84.6% 
of 
the 
cases 
if 
the 
worst 
OAI 
of 
the 
2 
nights 
was 
used 
as 
the 
diagnostic 
criterion 
of 
SDB. 


The 
phenomenon 
of 
FNE 
has 
been 
well 
reported 
in 
the 
adult 
population, 
and 
it 
has 
been 
suggested 
that 
age 
plays 
a 
significant 
part 
in 
its 
etiology, 
with 
evidence 
showing 
older 
subjects 
experiencing 
greater 
FNE.17 
But 
our 
findings 
and 
that 
of 
several 
other 
studies12,18 
would 
argue 
against 
that. 
To 
our 
knowledge, 
data 
assessing 
the 
night-to-night 
variability 
of 
childhood 
SDB 
severity 
and 
sleep 
architecture 
is 
very 
limited. 
Rebuffat 
et 
al19 
studied 
the 
night-tonight 
variability 
in 
sleep 
characteristics 
and 
frequency 
of 
apneas 
in 
healthy 
infants 
and 
found 
no 
significant 
variability 
between 
2 
consecutive 
nights. 
However, 
a 
habituation 
nap 
that 
preceded 
the 
actual 
recordings 
could 
have 
affected 
the 
result. 
Katz 
et 
al20 
performed 
polysomnography 
on 
30 
snoring 
children 
with 
a 
mean 
age 
of 
4.1 
years, 
and 
found 
that 
the 
clinical 
diagnosis 
of 
either 
SDB 
or 
primary 
snoring 
remained 
the 
same 
in 
all 
subjects 
tested. 
No 
statistically 
significant 
differences 
in 
sleep 
or 
respiratory 
variables 
were 
observed 
between 
the 
nights 
except

of 
total 
sleep 
time 
in 
stage 
2 
sleep, 
which 
was 
slightly 
higher 
on 
the 
second 
night. 
However, 
the 
sleep 
assessments 
were 
not 
performed 
on 
consecutive 
nights, 
and 
in 
fact 
they 
were 
done 
7 
to 
27 
days 
apart; 
thus, 
both 
nights 
could 
be 
considered 
as 
a 
first 
night 
in 
the 
laboratory. 
In 
our 
study, 
FNE 
was 
evident 
in 
all 
three 
groups 
of 
subjects 
tested, 
namely 
SDB 
subjects, 
primary 
snorers, 
and 
normal 
control 
subjects. 
The 
effect 
was 
most 
marked 
in 
the 
normal 
control 
group, 
with 
statistically 
significant 
decrease 
in 
stage 
1 
and 
2 
sleep 
on 
the 
second 
night. 
REM 
sleep 
rebound 
was 
only 
seen 
in 
the 
normal 
subjects, 
whereas 
a 
nonsignificant 
increase 
in 
SWS 
rebound 
was 
seen 
in 
the 
SDB 
group. 
Why 
there 
should 
be 
a 
discrepancy 
between 
the 
two 
groups 
in 
terms 
of 
FNE 
is 
unclear. 
This 
illustrates 
the 
complex 
relationship 
between 
sleep, 
respiratory 
function, 
and 
FNE. 


Contrary 
to 
our 
initial 
hypothesis 
that 
there 
might 
be 
worsening 
of 
SDB 
indexes 
on 
the 
second 
night, 
we 
found 
that 
there 
was 
actual 
significant 
improvement 
in 
AHI 
of 
the 
SDB 
subjects 
on 
the 
second 
night. 
We 
initially 
thought 
that 
the 
improvement 
was 
because 
the 
subjects 
were 
more 
at 
ease 
on

second 
night. 
As 
a 
result, 
they 
were 
more 
willing 
to 
turn 
to 
positions 
where 
they 
were 
most 
comfortable, 
for 
example, 
the 
lateral 
position 
that 
would 
reduce 
the 
degree 
of 
airway 
resistance 
with 
fewer 
apneas 
and 
hypopneas. 
However, 
the 
sleep 
position 
data 
did 
not 
support 
our 
initial 
hypothesis. 
There 
were 
no 
significant 
differences 
between 
the 
various 
positions 
over 
the 
2 
nights. 
Instead, 
this 
improvement 
of 
the 
severity 
of 
respiratory 
indexes 
may 
be 
most 
likely 
explained 
by 
the 
possible 
increase 
in

of

among 
the

subjects 
on

is 
actually 
protective 
against 
childhood 
SDB, 
and 
the 
underlying 
mechanism 
may 
be 
partly 
related 
to 
an 
increase 
in 
genioglossus 
muscle 
tone 
activity.22 
Nevertheless, 
the 
childhood 
data 
were 
in 
sharp 
contrast 
to 
the 
adult 
data, 
which 
demonstrated 
an 
exacerbation 
of 
SDB 
when 
sleep 
quality 
improved 
with 
both 
REM 
and 
SWS 
rebound 
on 
the 
second 
night.12 
The 
discrepancy 
between 
the 
results 
obtained 
in 
childhood 
and 
adult 
SDB 
certainly 
require 
further 
study, 
and 
may 
suggest 
that 
childhood 
SDB 
is 
more 
sensitive 
to 
SWS 
rebound 
rather 
than 
REM 
sleep 
rebound. 
It 
may 
also 
be 
hypothesized 
that 
the 
relative 
attrition 
of 
SWS 
in 
adult 
may 
dampen 
any 
potential 
of 
the 
rebound 
effect 
of 
SWS 
on 
the 
respiratory 
activity. 
If 
the 
potential 
protective 
value 
of 
SWS 
on 
childhood 
SDB 
is 
confirmed, 
it 
could 
suggest 
the 
potential 
use 
and 
development 
of 
pharmacologic 
agent 
in 
enhancing 
SWS 
in 
childhood 
SDB.23 


As 
discussed 
above, 
there 
is 
no 
universally 
accepted 
polysomnographic 
parameter 
for 
diagnosing 
SDB 
in 
children, 
and 
one 
of 
the 
most 
commonly 


–

used 
cutoffs 
is 
an 
OAI 
. 
1.68,24 
The 
alternative 
was 
to 
use 
various 
levels 
of 
AHI 
as 
the 
cutoff 
criteria.6–8 
The 
cutoff 
level 
of 
using 
AHI 
. 
5 
had 
the 
best 
correlation 
with 
OAI 
. 
1(0.71), 
while 
the 
cor


relation 
of 
OAI 
. 
1 
and 
AHI 
. 
2 
or 
3 
had 
low 
. 
values 
of 
0.22 
and 
0.31, 
respectively. 
In 
fact, 
if 
we 
used 
AHI 
. 
5, 
there 
was 
a 
similar 
finding 
of 
the 
improvement 
of 
AHI 
in 
the 
SDB 
group 
in 
association 
with 
a 
even 
more 
clear-cut 
and 
statistically 
significant 
SWS 
rebound 
but 
worsening 
of 
central 
respiratory 
disturbances 
in 
association 
of 
REM 
sleep 
rebound 
in 
the 
normal 
children. 
Nevertheless, 
as 
clearly 
suggested 
by 
the 
American 
Thoracic 
Society 
workshop 
summary, 
the 
diagnostic 
cutoff 
of 
OAI 
. 
1 
only 
suggested 
a 
statistical 
significance 
but 
more 
studies 
will 
be 
needed 
to 
find 
out 
the 
level 
of 
the 
indexes 
that 
will 
predict 
a 
clinical 
significance.7,8 
In 
this 
study, 
we 
used 
the 
worst 
OAI 
of 
the 
2 
nights 
as 
a 
standard. 
An 
alternative 
approach 
could 
be 
to 
use 
the 
mean 
OAI 
from 
the 
2 
nights, 
but 
currently 
there 
are 
no 
evidences 
as 
to 
which 
approach 
would 
be 
best 
correlated 
with 
clinical 
outcome. 
Using 
the 
worst 
OAI 
of 
2 
nights 
as 
the 
criterion, 
the 
first-night 
study 
would 
correctly 
identify 
84.6% 
of 
SDB 
cases. 
The 
cases 
missed 
by 
the 
single-night 
study 
belonged 
to 
the 
borderline 
range. 
The 
cost 
implication 
of 
our 
study 
findings 
is 
significant, 
as 
an 
additional 
night 
of 
polysomnography 
will 
mean 
extra 
manpower, 
resources, 
and 
lengthening 
of 
the 
waiting 
list. 


There 
are 
certain 
limitations 
to 
our 
study, 
including 
our 
small 
sample 
size, 
the 
exclusion 
of 
two 
most 
severely 
affected 
cases 
for 
trial 
of 
continuous 
positive 
airway 
pressure 
on 
the 
second 
night, 
and 
the 
use 
of 
thermistor 
signal 
that 
may 
limit 
the 
detection 
of 
subtle 
airflow 
changes. 
However, 
as 
we 
were 
measuring 
the 
night-to-night 
variability 
of 
SDB 
by 
using 
the 
same 
measurement 
technique, 
we 
believed 
that 
this 
would 
not 
alter 
our 
result 
significantly. 
It 
has 
been 
suggested 
that 
FNE 
may 
last 
for 
1 
night, 
and 
3 
consecutive 
nights 
might 
yield 
the 
most 
reliable 
representation 
of 
sleep, 
allowing 
for 
a 
FNE 
on 
night 
1, 
rebound 
sleep 
on 
night 
2, 
and 
usual 
sleep 
on 
night 


3.18,25 


The 
rationale 
being 
that 
the 
second 
night 
could 
be 
affected 
by 
partial 
REM 
sleep 
deprivation 
that 
occurred 
in 
the 
first 
night.26 
However, 
a 
study27 
investigated 
the 
FNE 
phenomenon 
across 
multiple 
sleep 
laboratory 
sessions 
with 
polysomnographic 
data 
from 
three 
different 
periods 
of 
4 
consecutive 
nights 
suggested 
that 
the 
FNE 
was 
present 
only 
in 
the 
“very 
first 
night” 
of 
the 
first 
period. 
We 
assessed 
obesity 
as 
the 
cause 
of 
SDB 
in 
our 
cohort 
of 
children, 
whether 
night-to-night 
variability 
also 
occurs 
in 
other 
causes 
of 
SDB 
will 
need 
further 
study. 


In 
summary, 
there 
were 
significant 
differences 
between 
2 
consecutive 
nights 
in 
the 
sleep 
architecture 
and 
respiratory 
indexes 
in 
our 
cohort 
of 
children 
with 
the 
demonstration 
of 
the 
FNE. 
A 
single-night 
study 
is 
able 
to 
identify 
84.6% 
of 
cases 
with 
SDB 
with 
the 
remaining 
having 
borderline 
OAI.
