ABSTRACT 


OBJECTIVE. 
Childhood 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
has 
an 
adverse 
impact 
on 
cognitive 
development, 
behavior, 
quality 
of 
life, 
and 
use 
of 
health 
care 
resources. 
Early 
viral 
infections 
and 
other 
immune-mediated 
responses 
may 
contribute 
to 
development 
of 
the 
chronic 
inflammation 
of 
the 
upper 
airway 
and 
hypertrophic 
upper 
airway 
lymphadenoid 
tissues 
underlying 
childhood 
sleep-disordered 
breathing. 
Breast-
feeding 
provides 
immunologic 
protection 
against 
such 
early 
exposures. 
Therefore, 
we 
sought 
to 
explore 
whether 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
severity 
would 
differ 
for 
children 
who 
were 
breastfed 
as 
infants. 


METHODS. 
The 
parents 
or 
guardians 
of 
196 
habitually 
snoring 
children 
(mean 
. 
SD: 


6.7 
. 
2.9 
years 
old) 
who 
were 
undergoing 
overnight 
polysomnography 
at 
Kosair 
Children’s 
Hospital 
Sleep 
Medicine 
and 
Apnea 
Center 
completed 
a 
retrospective 
survey 
on 
the 
method(s) 
used 
to 
feed 
the 
child 
as 
an 
infant. 
RESULTS. 
Among 
habitually 
snoring 
children, 
those 
who 
were 
fed 
breast 
milk 
for 
at 
least 
2 
months 
had 
significantly 
reduced 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
severity 
on 
every 
measure 
assessed, 
including 
apnea-hypopnea 
index, 
oxyhemoglobin 
de-
saturation 
nadir, 
and 
respiratory 
arousal 
index. 
Breastfeeding 
for 
longer 
than 
5 
months 
did 
not 
contribute 
additional 
benefits. 


CONCLUSIONS. 
Our 
findings 
support 
the 
notion 
that 
breastfeeding 
may 
provide 
long-
term 
protection 
against 
the 
severity 
of 
childhood 
sleep-disordered 
breathing. 
Future 
research 
should 
explore 
mechanism(s) 
whereby 
infant-feeding 
methods 
may 
affect 
the 
pathophysiology 
of 
development 
of 
childhood 
sleep-disordered 
breathing.

LEEP-DISORDERED 
BREATHING 
(SDB), 
a 
condition 
marked 
by 
intermittent 
hypoxia 
and 
hypercapnia 
and 
sleep 
fragmentation, 
is 
present 
in 
1 
to 
3% 
of 
children.
1,2 
Children 
with 
SDB 
are 
more 
frequent 
users 
of 
health 
care 
services,3 
experience 
more 
frequent 
comorbid 
chronic 
illnesses,4,5 
and 
may 
develop 
significant 
clinical 
cardiovascular 
morbidity.1,6–9 
They 
also 
display 
significant 
behavioral 
and 
cognitive 
comorbidities,10 
as 
well 
as 
reduced 
quality 
of 
life 
and 
mood 
alterations.11 
Animal 
models 
of 
SDB 
display 
long-term, 
partially 
irreversible 
neurocognitive 
consequences 
after 
intermittent 
hypoxia 
during 
sleep, 
particularly 
when 
such 
exposures 
occur 
early 
during 
development.12–14 


The 
relatively 
high 
rate 
at 
which 
SDB 
is 
diagnosed 
among 
otherwise 
healthy 
children 
and 
the 
implications 
for 
untreated 
SDB 
are 
a 
major 
health 
concern, 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
the 
American 
Academy 
of 
Pediatrics 
recommended 
that 
primary 
caregivers 
routinely 
screen 
their 
pediatric 
patients 
for 
the 
presence 
of 
snoring,15 
the 
cardinal 
symptom 
of 
SDB.16 
The 
preferential 
treatment 
of 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
in 
otherwise 
healthy 
children 
is 
surgical 
removal 
of 
adenoids 
and 
tonsils.17–20 


Although 
the 
pathophysiologic 
mechanisms 
underlying 
hypertrophy 
of 
these 
upper 
airway 
lymphadenoid 
tissues 
has 
remained 
unclear, 
direction 
can 
be 
taken 
from 
current 
studies 
of 
the 
lower 
airway 
suggesting 
that 
early 
exposure 
to 
respiratory 
syncytial 
virus 
infection 
and 
other 
frequent 
respiratory 
viral 
pathogens 
may 
lead 
to 
potential 
neurogenic 
inflammation21 
and 
airway 
remodeling, 
both 
of 
which 
may 
contribute 
to 
development 
of 
childhood 
asthma.22–24 
In 
the 
United 
States, 
nearly 
all 
children 
are 
infected 
with 
respiratory 
syncytial 
virus 
by 
their 
third 
year.25 
Preliminary 
evidence 
for 
the 
presence 
of 
similar 
pathways 
in 
development 
of 
upper 
airway 
lymphadenoid 
tissue 
hypertrophy 
has 
recently 
emerged.26,27 
Furthermore, 
inflammatory 
markers 
have 
been 
found 
in 
the 
adenotonsillar 
tissue 
of 
children 
who 
undergo 
surgery 
for 
SDB, 
and 
treatment 
with 
anti-inflammatory 
medications 
significantly 
reduces 
the 
respiratory 
parameters 
on 
polysomnography 
in 
these 
children.
28 


Breast 
milk 
and 
colostrum 
provide 
the 
infant 
with 
immunoglobulin 
A29,30 
and 
are 
considered 
a 
primary 
method 
for 
prevention 
of 
respiratory 
viral 
infections.31 
However, 
the 
impact 
of 
breastfeeding 
practices 
on 
the 
severity 
of 
SDB 
in 
children 
has 
not 
been 
heretofore 
examined. 
We 
therefore 
sought 
to 
test 
the 
hypothesis 
that 
children 
who 
had 
been 
fed 
breast 
milk 
as 
infants 
would 
be 
less 
likely 
to 
develop 
significant 
childhood 
SDB 
compared 
with 
children 
who 
had 
not 
been 
fed 
breast 
milk 
as 
infants 
and 
that 
the 
duration 
of 
breastfeeding 
may 
affect 
such 
association. 


METHODS 


Parents 
of 
habitually 
snoring 
children 
who 
were 
undergoing 
overnight 
polysomnography 
as 
either 
a 
clinic 
pa


tient 
or 
a 
participant 
in 
a 
larger 
research 
study 
at 
the 
Kosair 
Children’s 
Hospital 
Sleep 
Medicine 
and 
Apnea 
Center 
were 
invited 
to 
fill 
out 
a 
brief 
survey 
about 
the 
feeding 
method(s) 
that 
they 
used 
when 
their 
child 
was 
an 
infant. 
A 
cover 
letter 
that 
described 
implied 
consent 
and 
Health 
Insurance 
Portability 
and 
Accountability 
Act 
authorization 
was 
administered 
as 
approved 
by 
the 
institutional 
review 
boards 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Louisville 
and 
Norton 
Healthcare. 


Feeding-Methods 
Survey 


The 
paper-and-pencil 
survey 
included 
child 
demographics 
(age, 
gender, 
ethnicity, 
and 
birth 
order), 
whether 
anyone 
in 
the 
household 
smoked, 
and 
the 
relationship 
of 
the 
survey 
respondent 
to 
the 
child. 
The 
respondent 
was 
asked 
to 
identify 
the 
method(s) 
used 
to 
feed 
the 
child 
during 
the 
first 
year 
of 
life: 
formula 
only 
(no 
breast 
milk), 
breast 
milk 
only 
(no 
formula), 
or 
both 
formula 
and 
breast 
milk. 
For 
those 
who 
were 
fed 
any 
breast 
milk, 
the 
age 
in 
months 
at 
which 
the 
child 
was 
completely 
weaned 
was 
also 
identified. 
Finally, 
the 
respondent 
was 
asked, 
“How 
well 
do 
you 
remember 
this 
information?” 
on 
a 
5-point 
scale 
from 
“not 
at 
all 
confident” 
to 
“completely 
confident.” 


Polysomnography 
and 
Scoring 


With 
the 
parent 
or 
guardian 
present, 
overnight 
polysomnography 
was 
performed 
by 
using 
commercially 
available 
multichannel 
data-acquisition 
equipment 
and 
scoring 
software 
(MedCare 
Diagnostics, 
Amsterdam, 
Netherlands) 
to 
record 
8 
channels 
of 
electroencephalography 
(O1/O2, 
P3/P4, 
C3/C4, 
F3/F4), 
submental 
chin 
and 
anterior 
tibialis 
electromyography, 
bilateral 
electrooculogram, 
snore 
sensor, 
electrocardiogram, 
chest 
and 
abdominal 
inductance 
plethysmography, 
pulse 
oxygen 
saturation 
(SpO2) 
and 
wave 
form, 
and 
oronasal 
airflow 
(assessed 
through 
an 
oronasal 
thermistor, 
end-
tidal 
CO2, 
and 
nasal 
pressure 
transducer). 
Simultaneous 
video 
and 
audio 
monitoring 
was 
digitally 
recorded. 
No 
study 
was 
performed 
on 
a 
night 
when 
a 
child 
had 
an 
acute 
illness, 
fever, 
or 
nasal 
discharge. 
Records 
were 
scored 
by 
an 
analyst 
who 
was 
blinded 
to 
the 
infantfeeding–
method 
status. 


Stage 
scoring 
was 
performed 
using 
standard 
criteria.32 
Because 
criteria 
for 
arousals 
have 
not 
yet 
been 
established 
for 
children, 
arousals 
were 
defined 
as 
recommended 
by 
the 
American 
Sleep 
Disorders 
Association 
Task 
Force 
report33 
and 
manually 
scored 
as 
spontaneous 
or 
respiratory 
related 
(occurring 
immediately 
subsequent 
to 
an 
apnea, 
hypopnea, 
oxyhemoglobin 
desaturation, 
or 
snore) 
and 
reported 
as 
indices 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
occurrence 
per 
hour 
of 
total 
sleep

(TST). 


Central

were 
scored 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
cessation 
of

whereas 
decreases 
in

50% 
with 
continued

were 
scored 
as 
hypopneas, 
provided 
that 
these

had 
a 
minimum 
duration 
of 
2 
breath-lengths 
and 
an 
associated 
4% 
SpO2

and/or 
arousal.34,35 
Snoring 
was 
scored 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
a 
change 
in 
basal 
snore 
sensor 
levels 
that 
was 
additionally 
verified 
and 
annotated 
by 
the 
technologist 
via 
both 
in-room 
checks 
and 
microphone 
transmission. 
SpO2 
nadir 
and 
oxyhemoglobin 
desaturations 
were 
calculated 
from 
valid 
SpO2 
tracings 
during 
sleep 
with 
values 
during 
movement 
artifact 
excluded. 
Scoring 
of 
all 
respiratory 
events 
and 
oxyhemoglobin 
desaturations 
were 
initially 
automated 
and 
then 
user 
verified. 
Respiratory 
events 
were 
scored 
as 
indices 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
number 
of 
events 
per 
hour 
of 
TST. 
An 
apnea-hypopnea 
index 
(AHI) 
was 
calculated 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
number 
of 
combined 
apneas 
and 
hypopneas 
per 
hour 
of 
TST. 
Statistical 
Analyses 


Descriptive 
statistics 
were 
calculated. 
Group 
comparisons 
with 
dichotomous 
variables 
were 
made 
by 
using 
the 
2 
test; 
those 
with 
continuous 
variables 
were 
performed 
by 
using 
1-way 
analysis 
of 
variance. 
Data 
were 
analyzed 
by 
using 
SPSS 
14.0 
(SPSS, 
Chicago, 
IL), 
and 
P 


. 
.05 
was 
considered 
statistically 
significant. 
Cohen’s 
d 
with 
pooled 
SDs 
was 
calculated 
to 
determine 
effect 
sizes. 
RESULTS 


Of 
the 
212 
surveys 
completed, 
polysomnography 
data 
were 
available 
for 
196 
children. 
There 
were 
no 
differences 
on 
demographic 
measures 
between 
habitually 
snoring 
children 
who 
were 
recruited 
from 
the 
larger 
research 
study 
(n 
. 
89) 
and 
clinical 
patients 
(n 
. 
107); 
therefore, 
their 
databases 
were 
combined. 
Child

lower 
AHI 
at 
every 
duration 
of 
breastfeeding. 
The 
breastfed 
children 
also 
had 
higher 
SpO2

through 
11 
months 
of 
breastfeeding 
and 
lower 
respiratory 
arousal 
indices 
than 
those 
who 
were 
never 
breastfed. 


Second, 
comparisons 
were 
made 
between 
infants 
who 
were 
breastfed 
for 
increasing 
durations 
compared 
with 
those 
who 
were 
breastfed 
for 
less 
than 
that 
duration 
(eg, 
2vs 
2 
months 
of 
breastfeeding, 
3vs 
3 
months 
of 
breastfeeding) 
There 
was 
an 
insufficient 
number 
of 
children 
who 
breastfed 
2 
months 
for 
comparisons. 
(Note

only 
breastfed

in 
these 
comparisons,

Longer

of

was 
associated 
with 
lower

higher 
SpO2

through 
5 
months 
of 
breastfeeding, 
and 
lower 
respiratory

through 
3

Breastfeeding 
beyond 
5 
months 
did 
not 
seem 
to 
provide 
added 
benefits 
on 
these

of

DISCUSSION 


This 
study 
shows 
that 
among 
children 
who 
had 
symptoms 
of 
SDB, 
those 
who 
were 
fed 
breast 
milk 
when 
they 
were 
infants 
had 
significantly 
reduced 
disease 
severity. 
Breastfeeding 
for 
5 
months 
did 
not 
seem 
to 
contribute 
additional 
benefits. 
The 
differences 
among 
polysomnography 
measures 
of 
SDB 
between 
children 
who 
had 
and 
had 
not 
been 
breastfed 
were 
clinically 
significant: 
children 
who 
were 
breastfed 
had 
polysomnography-related 
severity 
measures 
below 
the 
standard 
threshold 
for 
surgical 
treatment. 


We 
see 
2 
possible 
explanations 
for 
these 
findings. 
First, 
as 
described 
in 
the 
introduction, 
the 
reduced 
severity 
of 
SDB 
in 
breastfed 
children 
may 
be 
explained 
by 
the 
immunologic 
protection 
that 
is 
provided 
by 
breast 
milk. 
This 
notion 
is 
supported 
by 
the 
growing 
evidence 
suggesting 
that 
early 
respiratory 
viral 
exposures 
may 
contribute 
to 
the 
development 
of 
childhood 
SDB 
by 
facilitating 
airway 
remodeling 
and, 
potentially, 
promoting 
propitious 
conditions 
for 
enhanced 
proliferation 
of 
upper 
airway 
lymphadenoid 
tissues 
ultimately 
facilitating 
the 
occurrence 
of 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy.21,23,24,27,28 
Indeed, 
overgrowth 
of 
these 
upper 
airway 
tissues 
is 
1 
of 
the 
major 
causative 
factors 
of 
pediatric 
SDB, 
such 
that 
surgical 
removal 
of 
these 
tissues 
is 
the 
first-line 
treatment 
for 
SDB 
in 
otherwise 
healthy 
children 
without 
craniofacial 
or 
neuromuscular 
abnormalities.17–20,36 
It 
is 
likely 
that 
in 
the 
context 
of 
differential 
exposures 
and 
immune 
responses 
to 
respiratory 
pathogens 
during 
early 
infancy 
as 
modulated 
by 
breastfeeding 
practices, 
differences 
would 
also 
emerge 
in 
the 
immunologic 
substrate 
of 
upper 
airway 
lymphadenoid 
tissues. 
In 
support 
of 
such 
assumption, 
adenotonsillar 
tissues 
of 
children 
with 
SDB 
are 
distinct 
from 
those 
with

recurrent 
infections 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
expression 
and 
distribution 
of 
cysteinyl 
leukotriene 
receptors, 
suggesting 
that 
the 
mechanism 
for 
inflammation 
may 
be 
different 
in 
children 
with 
SDB.37 


Another 
possible 
explanation 
for 
our 
findings 
is 
that 
oral 
cavity 
features 
such 
as 
high 
palates, 
narrow 
dental 
arches, 
and 
retruded 
chin 
all 
are 
additional 
risk 
factors 
for 
SDB 
in 
children.38 
Breastfeeding 
promotes 
healthy 
jaw 
formation, 
thereby 
preventing 
the 
occurrence 
of 
many 
of 
these 
anatomic 
issues39,40; 
therefore, 
the 
mechanical 
aspects 
of 
breastfeeding 
may 
provide 
additional 
protection 
against 
development 
of 
SDB 
in 
that 
this 
feeding 
method 
promotes 
an 
upper 
airway 
that 
is 
less 
vulnerable 
to 
narrowing 
and 
collapse 
during 
sleep. 


It 
is 
important 
to 
note 
that 
although 
our 
findings 
indicate 
that 
disease 
severity 
is 
reduced 
in 
association 
with 
breastfeeding, 
our 
work 
and 
that 
of 
others 
have 
consistently 
shown 
that 
even 
clinically 
mild 
levels 
of 
childhood 
SDB 
are 
associated 
with 
cognitive 
and 
behavioral 
compromise 
(see 
review 
by 
Beebe10). 
Our 
work 
should 
not 
be 
interpreted 
to 
suggest 
that 
breastfeeding 
entirely 
prevents 
the 
development 
of 
SDB. 
Although 
severity 
was 
shown 
to 
be 
reduced 
in 
this 
sample, 
there 
is 
no 
consensus 
on 
what 
constitutes 
a 
safe 
level 
of 
SDB, 
if 
any, 
so 
treatment 
should 
not 
be 
delayed 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
a 
child’s 
feeding 
method. 


There 
are 
several 
limitations 
to 
this 
preliminary 
investigation 
of 
the 
relationship 
between 
infant 
feeding 
and 
development 
of 
SDB. 
First, 
the 
retrospective 
feeding-
methods 
survey 
has 
not 
been 
validated, 
although 
the 
high 
rate 
of 
confidence 
with 
which 
the 
respondent 
recalled 
the 
information 
was 
reassuring. 
Second, 
the 
proportion 
of 
breast 
milk 
feedings 
that 
were 
given 
by 
bottle 
is 
unknown 
and, 
as 
described, 
this 
may 
have 
some 
bearing 
on 
the 
mechanism 
by 
which 
breastfeeding 
has 
its 
beneficial 
effects 
on 
severity 
of 
SDB. 
Future 
investigations 
of 
this 
effect 
may 
use 
a 
dosage-response 
approach 
to 
take 
into 
account 
the 
proportion 
of 
breast 
milk 
feedings 
given 
via 
breast 
versus 
bottle 
and 
the 
type 
of 
nipple 
used 
for 
bottle 
feedings. 
Furthermore, 
although 
we 
did 
not 
find 
ethnicity-related 
differences 
on 
the 
incidence 
or 
duration 
of 
breastfeeding 
in 
this 
sample, 
future 
work 
should 
acquire 
more 
precise 
data 
to 
control 
for 
socioeconomic 
status 
as 
a 
possible 
confounder. 
Data 
on 
familial 
history 
of 
snoring 
and 
presence 
of 
SDB 
should 
also 
be 
collected 
in 
future 
investigations. 
Finally, 
because 
all 
of 
the 
children 
in 
this 
sample 
were 
habitual 
snorers, 
we 
did 
not 
measure 
differences 
in 
snoring 
prevalence 
between 
former 
breastfed 
and 
formula-fed 
infants. 
Future 
investigations 
into 
differences 
in 
rates 
and 
severity 
of 
SDB 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
infant-feeding 
methods 
is 
necessary. 


CONCLUSIONS 


Our 
findings 
support 
the 
notion 
that 
breastfeeding 
may 
provide 
long-term 
protection 
against 
the 
incidence 


and/or 
severity 
of 
childhood 
SDB. 
Future 
research 
aiming 
to 
explore 
the 
mechanism(s) 
by 
which 
infant-feeding 
methods 
may 
affect 
the 
pathophysiology 
of 
childhood 
SDB 
seems 
warranted.
