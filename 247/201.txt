Background: 
Children 
with 
mild 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
(SDB), 
who 
may 
not 
be 
recommended 
for 
adenotonsillectomy, 
frequently

morbidity, 
and 
may 
benefit 
from 
alternative 
therapeutic 
interventions, 
such 
as

therapy. 
Methods: 
Twenty-four 
children 
with 
SDB 
completed 
an 
open-label 
intervention 
study 
for 
16 
weeks 
with 
daily

therapy. 
Sleep

and 
adenoid 
size 
estimates 
from 
lateral 
X-ray 
films 
of 
the 
neck 
were 
obtained 
before 
and 
after 
treatment. 
In 
a 
parallel 
study, 
adenoid 
and 
tonsillar 
tissues 
from 
children 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
or 
recurrent 
throat 
infections 
were 
subjected 
to 
quantitative 
polymerase

reaction, 
immunohistochemistry, 
and 
Western 
blotting 
for 
gene 
and 
protein 
expression 
of

receptors 
LT1-R 
and 
LT2-R, 
and 
for 
concentrations 
of 
LTB4 
and 
LTC4/D4/E4. 
Results: 
Montelukast 
treatment 
induced 
significant 
reductions 
in 
adenoid 
size 
and 
respiratory-related 
sleep 
disturbances, 
which 
were 
absent 
in 
16 
children 
with 
SDB 
who 
did 
not 
receive 
treatment. 
LT1-R 
and 
LT2-R 
mRNA 
was 
similarly 
abundant 
in 
adenoid 
tissues, 
but 
increased 
LT1-R 
and 
LT2-R 
protein 
expression 
and 
higher 
levels 
of 
LTB4 
and 
LTC4/D4/E4 
emerged 
in 
children 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea. 
Conclusions: 
Oral 
therapy 
with

Obstructive sleep apnea (SA) is a common and highly prevalent 
disorder in the pediatric age range, affecting 2 to 3% of all 
children (1). This disorder is usually due, at least in part, to 
adenotonsillar hypertrophy (2, 3). If left untreated, SA can result 
in serious morbidity, primarily affecting neurobehavioral and 
cardiovascular systems (4–11). Thus, adenotonsillectomy (T&A) 
is currently the most common treatment for children with SA 
(12). However, although definitive polysomnographic criteria 
are not available, T&A is usually reserved for children whose 
respiratory disturbance (apnea–hypopnea index [AHI]) during 
sleep exceeds 5 events/hour of sleep. Although most clinicians 
agree that snoring children with an AHI of less than 1 event/ 
hour of sleep do not require any intervention, there is presently 
no consensus on the appropriate management of children with

an AHI of more than 1 but less than 5 events/hour of sleep, 
even if such children are at risk for associated morbidity (13). 

Nonsurgical antiinflammatory approaches have been cautiously 
advocated for SA in children (14, 15). Indeed, nasal 
and oropharyngeal mucosal inflammation are present in adult 
patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (16–19), and 
C-reactive protein, a systemic marker for inflammation, was 
recently reported to be increased in the serum of children with 
SA, and to correlate with the severity of their respiratory disturbance 
during sleep (20). Thus, systemic antiinflammatory agents 
with safe therapeutic profiles for use in children with sleep-
disordered breathing (SDB) could serve as an alternative intervention 
to T&A. 

Montelukast is an orally bioavailable cysteinyl leukotriene 
(LT) receptor antagonist that is effective, safe, well tolerated, 
and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for 
preventive therapy for the inflammatory component in asthma 
and allergic rhinitis in children 2 years and older (21–24), with 
no demonstrable development of tolerance in long-term studies 
(25, 26). We have recently found that the cloned human cysteinyl 
LT receptors 1 and 2 (LT1-R, LT2-R) (27, 28) have increased 
expression in the tonsillar tissues of children with SA (29). On 
the basis of such findings, we compared the relative abundance 
of LTs and their receptors in the lymphoid tissue of children 
with or without SDB, and furthermore investigated the effects 
of a 16-week course of montelukast on sleep and airway patency 
in children with mild SDB. 

METHODS 


Patients 


The study was approved by the University of Louisville Human Research 
Committee, and informed consent was obtained from the legal 
caretaker of each participant. Assent was also obtained from children 
if they were older than 6 years. 

Open-label 
treatment 
with 
montelukast. 
Twenty-four consecutive patients 
evaluated for SDB in the Kosair Children’s Hospital Sleep Medicine 
and Apnea Center who fulfilled inclusion criteria were recruited 
to the study, and these patients completed a 16-week treatment with 
daily montelukast. As control subjects, 16 additional children fulfilling 
the same inclusion criteria, and who were not offered this therapeutic 
modality while receiving care from other attending physicians at the 
sleep center, were identified and recruited to the study. 

Criteria for inclusion included the following: children older than 2 
and younger than 10 years who were habitual snorers (reported to 
snore by parents . 
4 nights/week), who were found to have an obstructive 
AHI of more than 1 but less than 5 events/hour of sleep in an 
overnight polysomnographic evaluation, and in whom a lateral neck 
X-ray film was obtained as part of their clinical evaluation. Exclusion 
criteria included the following: craniofacial, neuromuscular, syndromic, 
or defined genetic abnormalities; current or previous use of montelukast; 
acute upper respiratory tract infection; use of any corticosteroids 
or antibiotics in the 4 weeks preceding the initial sleep study; and T&A 
in the past. 

Oral montelukast therapy consisted of the daily administration of 
a 4-mg chewable tablet (Singulair; Merck, Whitehouse Station, NJ) for 
children younger than 6 years, and a 5-mg tablet for children 6 years 
and older. Parents were instructed to give the tablet at bedtime. Parents

were contacted weekly by the investigators to determine compliance, and 
to follow-up on potential side effects. On completion of the 16-week 
course, patients underwent a second overnight sleep study and lateral 
neck X-ray. 

Lateral 
Neck 
X-Rays 


For assessment of airway patency, lateral neck X-rays were performed 
using standard techniques in the radiology department of the hospital. 
The neck was extended and the patient was instructed to breathe 
through the nose. The adenoidal/nasopharyngeal ratio was measured 
according to the method of Fujioka and colleagues (30) by two of the 
present investigators (A.D.G. and D.G.), who were blinded to the 
polygraphic findings of the subjects. 

Overnight 
Polysomnography 


All children participating in the study were studied twice using polysomnography, 
once before inclusion in the study and at the end of 
the 16-week intervention period. Sleep studies were performed in a 
dedicated quiet, dark room. No sleep deprivation or sedation was used. 
Children were studied for at least 8 hours in a quiet, darkened room 
with an ambient temperature of 24C in the company of one of their 
parents. The following parameters were measured: chest and abdominal 
wall movement by respiratory impedance or inductance plethysmography 
and heart rate by ECG. Airflow was monitored with a side-
stream end-tidal capnograph, which also provides breath-by-breath 
assessment of end-tidal carbon dioxide levels (Pryon, Menomonee Falls, 
WI), as well as a nasal pressure transducer (Braebon, Carp, ON, Canada) 
and an oronasal thermistor. SaO2 was assessed by pulse oximetry 
(Nellcor N100; Nellcor, Inc., Hayward, CA), with simultaneous recording 
of the pulse waveform. The bilateral electro-oculogram, eight 
channels of EEG, chin and bilateral anterior tibial and forearm EMG, 
and analog output from a body position sensor were also monitored. 
All measures were digitized using a commercially available polysomnographic 
system (Rembrandt; MedCare Diagnostics, Amsterdam, The 
Netherlands). Tracheal sounds were monitored with a microphone sensor, 
and a digital time-synchronized video recording was performed. 

Analysis of the polysomnogram was performed using standard techniques 
by an experienced sleep technologist who was not aware that 
the sleep studies belonged to study participants. In brief, sleep staging 
was assessed using standard criteria (31). The obstructive AHI was 
defined as the number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of total sleep 
time, and obstructive apnea was defined as the absence of airflow with 
continued chest wall and abdominal movement for a duration of at 
least two breaths (32, 33). Hypopneas were defined as a decrease in 
nasal flow of 50% or more with a corresponding decrease in SpO2 of 
4% or more and/or arousal (32). The mean SpO2 together with SpO2 
nadir were determined. Arousals were defined as recommended by the 
American Sleep Disorders Association Task Force report (34) and 
include respiratory-related (occurring immediately after an apnea, hypopnea, 
or snore), technician-induced, and spontaneous arousals. 
Arousals were expressed as the total number of arousals per hour of 
sleep time (ARtotI). In addition, as a surrogate measure for sleepiness, 
the recently developed sleep pressure score (35) was calculated for each 
subject’s polysomnographic record as follows: sleep pressure score . 
RAI/ARtotI . 
(1 . 
SAI/ARtotI), where RAI represents the respiratory-
related arousal index and SAI the spontaneous arousal index. A sleep 
pressure score of 0.25 or more was used as the threshold for evidence 
of increased sleepiness (35, 36). 

Adenotonsillar 
Tissue 
Collection 


Because adenotonsillar tissue cannot be obtained from normal children 
for obvious ethical reasons, a cohort different from the one described 
above and consisting of consecutive children undergoing T&A for either 
SA or recurrent infectious tonsillitis (RI) were identified before surgery 
and recruited to the study. The diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea 
syndrome was established by standard overnight polysomnography in 
the sleep laboratory, and required the presence of an AHI of more 
than 5 events/hour of sleep (12). Patients referred for RI were selected 
on the basis of a history of at least five tonsillar infections in less than 
6 months; because the absence of any symptoms suggestive of SA 
essentially negates the presence of this condition (37), the patients were 
not evaluated by an overnight polysomnogram, since our questionnaire-

based evaluation is highly sensitive and specific in ruling out SDB in 
children (37). For inclusion, children with RI were required to have 
received their last dose of antibiotic therapy 6 weeks or longer from 
the day of surgery. Children with known asthma, allergic rhinitis, or 
history of allergies, and/or those having received corticosteroid or LT 
modifier therapy within 1 year from surgery were excluded. Both palatine 
tonsils and adenoids were removed by a pediatric ear, nose, and 
throat specialist; a portion of each tonsil was snap-frozen in liquid 
nitrogen and stored at 80C. Another portion of each tonsil was fixed 
in 4% formalin, cryoprotected with 30% sucrose, and kept at 4C. 
Adenoids were randomly assigned to be kept either in formalin or at 
80C. All samples were numbered and coded by one of the research 
coordinators and were subsequently assayed by one of the authors 
(A.D.G.), who was blinded to the specific diagnosis of each of the 
samples. 

Quantitative 
(Real-Time) 
Polymerase 
Chain 
Reaction 


Total RNA was prepared from adenoid or tonsillar tissues using Trizol reagent 
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. 
Isolated total RNA was quantified using a spectrophotometer (Beckman 
DU-530, Fullerton, CA). Aliquots of total RNA (1 g) were reverse-
transcribed using random primers and Superscript II-Reverse Transcriptase 
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. cDNA 
equivalent to 20 ng of total RNA was subjected to real-time polymerase 
chain reaction analysis (MX4000; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following 
the manufacturer’s protocol. Polymerase chain reaction primers 
(Invitrogen) and Taqman probes (Biosearch Technologies, Novato, 
CA) for LTR-1, LTR-2 and -actin were designed by Beacon Designer 

2.0 software (Premier Biosoft International, Palo Alto, CA). The primer 
and probe for LTR-1 were as follows: forward primer, 5-TTATGTTCA 
CAAAGGCATTTGG-3; reverse primer, 5-GCTCATGGCTGTCT 
AAAGAA-3; Taqman probe, 5-FAM-GGTGACTTCTTGTGCCGC 
CTC-BHQ-1-3. The primer and probe for LTR-2 were as follows: forward 
primer, 5-ACTATATTGCCTTGGTGGTGGG-3; reverse primer, 
5-ATGATGGTGGTCAGTGCCTTC-3; Taqman probe, 5-(FAM)TGTGAGAAACCCGCAGCCCCGA-(
BHQ-1)-3; and for -actin: 
forward primer, 5-GACTACCTCATGAAGATCCTCACC-3; reverse 
primer, 5-TCTCCTTAATGTCAC GCACGATT-3; Taqman probe, 
5-FAM-CGGCTACAGCTTCACCACCACGG-BHQ-1-3. Each reaction 
(25 l) contained 2.5 l reaction buffer (10), 6 mM MgCl2,0.2 M 
dNTP, 0.6 M each primer, 0.25 l SureStar Taq DNA polymerase 
(Cerestar, Cedar Rapids, IA), and 2 l cDNA dilutions. The cycling 
conditions consisted of one cycle at 95C for 10 minutes and 40 two-
segment cycles (95C for 30 seconds and 55C for 60 seconds). Standard 
curves for target gene (LTR-1 or LTR-2) and the housekeeping gene 
(-actin) were performed for each assay. Briefly, 10-fold serial dilutions 
of control cDNA were amplified by the MX-4000 polymerase chain 
reaction machine (Stratagene). The CT value (initial amplification cycle) 
of each standard dilution was plotted against standard cDNA copy 
numbers. On the basis of the standard curves for each gene, the sample 
cDNA copy number was calculated according to the sample CT value. 
Finally, each of the calculated copy numbers for either LTR-1 or LTR-2 
was normalized against the corresponding -actin copy numbers, and 
are therefore expressed as ratios of the gene of interest and corresponding 
-actin value. Standard curves and polymerase chain reaction results 
were analyzed using MX-4000 software (Stratagene). 
Immunohistochemistry 


Coronal sections (30 m) of both tonsil and adenoid tissues were initially 
incubated in 0.3% H2O2 for 30 minutes, washed several times in 
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and blocked with a PBS/0.4% Triton 
X-100/0.5% Tyramide Signal Amplification (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, 
Boston, MA) blocking reagent/10% normal goat serum (Vector 
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 1 hour. Sections were then serially 
incubated with LTR-1 antibody (1:1500; Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, 
MI) at 4C for 24 hours, and then washed in PBS six times for 5 minutes 
each wash. Sections were then incubated at room temperature for 1 
hour in biotinylated antirabbit antibody (1:600; Vectastain Elite ABC 
kit; Vector Laboratories) in a PBS/0.5% Tyramide Signal Amplification 
blocking reagent /10% goat serum solution. After three 5-minute washes, 
sections were incubated at room temperature with streptavidin–horseradish 
peroxidase diluted 1:100 in PBS/0.5% Tyramide Signal Amplifi

cation blocking reagent. Subsequently, the sections were incubated with 
tetramethyl rhodamine tyramide (red) diluted 1:50 in amplification 
diluent (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences) for 2 minutes. Sections were processed 
the same way again and subsequently incubated with serum 
raised against myeloperoxidase (1:1000; Labvision, Fremont, CA) at 
4C for 24 hours, followed by a biotinylated antirabbit antibody (1:600; 
Vectastain Elite ABC kit; Vector Laboratories), and by fluorescein 
tyramide reagent (green) diluted 1:50 for 3 minutes. Sections were then 
washed in PBS, and mounted onto glass slides. Negative controls were 
prepared by either omitting the primary or the secondary antibodies 
for either of the primary antibodies. Sections were prepared from seven 
sets of tonsils and of adenoids from either SA or RI groups, and were 
visualized using a fluorescent microscope by an investigator who was 
blinded to the sample source. 

Western 
Blotting 


Tonsils and adenoids were homogenized in a lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, 
pH 7.5, 0.4% NP-40, 10% glycerol, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 
20 mg/ml leupeptin, 10 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 1 mM 
sodium orthovanadate, 100 mM sodium fluoride), and the protein concentration 
was determined using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad DC, 
Hercules, CA). Samples (40 g protein) were resolved on 12% sodium 
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels using electrophoresis (Novex/ 
Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 120 minutes at 120 V, and electroblotted 
onto 0.2-m nitrocellulose membranes for 90 minutes at 30 V. Membranes 
were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in total buffered saline-T 
(total buffered saline . 
0.05% Tween 20), and were then incubated 
overnight at 4C with primary antibodies recognizing the human LT1-R 
(1:500; Cayman Chemical), or the LT2-R (1:500; Cayman Chemical), 
and later with anti–-actin (1:20,000; Sigma, St. Louis, MO), both diluted 
in 5% milk. Lanes were also incubated with a mixture of the 
primary antibody and the receptor-blocking peptide (1:2 ratio) to establish 
a competition assay. Membranes were washed with TBS-T, and 
incubated with either horseradish peroxidase–linked antirabbit or anti-
mouse antibodies (for LT receptors and -actin, respectively). Proteins 
were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham, Piscataway, 
NJ). The intensities of the bands corresponding to the protein of interest 
were quantified using scanning densitometry, expressed as the ratio of the 
density corresponding to the protein of interest and corresponding -actin, 
and compared using t 
tests or analysis of variance as appropriate. 

LT 
Concentrations 


All adenoid and tonsillar tissue specimens (n . 
20 for SA group, n . 
9 
for RI group) were processed as described by Bachert and colleagues 
(38). In brief, tissues were weighed, and 1 ml of 0.9% NaCl solution 
was added per 0.1 g of tissue. Tissues were then homogenized with a 
mechanical homogenizer at 5,000 rpm for 5 minutes (Tissue-Tearor; 
BioSpec Products, Inc., Bartlesville, OK). After homogenization, suspensions 
were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4C, and 
supernatants were separated and stored at 80C. All supernatants 
were assayed for LTs LTC4/D4/E4 (cysteinyl LTs) and LTB4 by means 
of a specific immunoassay (enzyme-linked immunoassay) kit with commercially 
available kits (LTC4/D4/E4: Cayman Chemical; LTB4: Amersham 
Biosciences). All samples were loaded in duplicates and assayed 
at two dilutions, and plate reader absorbance results were analyzed 
with a four-parameter logistic curve fit. The intraassay and interassay 
variability for LTB4 and LTC4/D4/E4 assays was less than 10%. The 
specificity of LTB4 and LTC4/D4/E4 assays was 100% (except for 
LTB4, which was 67%). The detection limit of the assays was 6.2 pg/ml 
for LTB4 and 7.8 pg/ml for LTC4/D4/E4. 

Statistical 
Analysis 


Results are presented as means . 
SD, unless stated otherwise. All 
numeric data were subjected to statistical analyses using either t 
tests 
or analysis of variance procedures followed by Newman-Keuls post 
hoc 
tests, as appropriate. A two-tailed p value of less than 0.05 was considered 
statistically significant. 

RESULTS 


Montelukast 
Treatment 


A total of 13 boys and 11 girls completed the montelukast treatment 
arm of the study. Their mean age was 5.4 . 
2.0 years 

(range, 2.5–10 years); their body mass index was 19.5 . 
0.9 kg/m2; 
and 62.5% were white and 37.5% African American. The adenoidal/
nasopharyngeal ratio (Figure 1) significantly decreased from 

0.76 . 
0.03 to 0.56 . 
0.03 (p . 
0.001) after 16 weeks of montelukast 
treatment. For sleep-related variables, the obstructive AHI 
and apnea index significantly decreased with treatment (Table 
1). Although ARtotI did not decrease significantly (16.87 . 
1.52 to 14.4 . 
1.26, p . 
not significant), RAI was significantly 
improved (7.15 . 
0.79 to 3.01 . 
0.33, p . 
0.001; Table 1), as 
was the sleep pressure score (0.25 . 
0.02 to 0.12 . 
0.02, p . 
0.0016; Table 1). No significant changes occurred in total sleep 
time, mean sleep latency, sleep efficiency, number of awakenings, 
or in the mean and nadir saturation values recorded during sleep. 
However, improvements in peak end-tidal carbon dioxide levels 
were observed after montelukast (Table 1). No significant 
changes emerged in the distribution of sleep stages except for 
a decrease in the percentage of time spent in stage 1 non-REM 
sleep. There were no adverse drug reactions reported throughout 
the study, with excellent compliance and no attrition. In contrast, 
with such findings, children who received no therapy displayed 
no significant changes in any of the anatomic and polysomnographic 
measures during the 16-week period (Table 1). 
Adenotonsillar 
Tissue 
Assessments 


Adenoid and tonsillar tissues were obtained from 38 children 
(20 SA and 18 RI). The mean age for this cohort was 5.2 . 


2.8 years (range, 2–10 years; 21 males; 67% white/33% African 
American). LT1-R and LT2-R mRNA was present in all 16 
adenoids studied. However, no significant differences in gene 
expression emerged between the SA and the RI groups for either 
LT1-R (n . 
8/group; 0.41 . 
0.13 in SA vs. 0.31 . 
0.07 in RI, 
p . 
not significant) or LT2-R (n . 
8/group; 0.008 . 
0.003 in 
SA vs. 0.017 . 
0.013 in RI, p . 
not significant). 
LT1-R immunoreactivity was abundantly expressed in the 
adenoidal and tonsillar epithelial layers and within the extra 
follicular area in the tonsillar parenchyma. Clusters of LT1-R 
positively labeled cells were also present within blood vessels. 
No staining for LT1-R was detected in the tonsillar germinal 
centers (Figure 2). In contrast, only a restricted number of cells 
primarily constrained to the epithelial layer expressed the LT1-R 
in the tonsils obtained from patients with RI (Figure 2). Colabeling 
with a myeloperoxidase antibody (for identification of 
neutrophils and eosinophils) was primarily observed within 
LT1-R–expressing cells in the patients with SA (Figure 2). Immunoblots 
of adenoidal lysates for LT1-R detected a protein with 
the appropriate molecular weight of approximately 38 kD (Figure 
3), which was further confirmed by a competition assay with the 
immunogenic peptide. LT1-R expression in both adenoids and 
tonsils was significantly higher in the SA group compared with

DISCUSSION 


This study shows that a 16-week course of an orally administered 
LT receptor antagonist is associated with significant improvements 
in upper airway patency and in the severity of SDB, and 
that these improvements fail to occur when no treatment is 
administered. Furthermore, in a different set of children, we 
show that enhanced expression of LT receptors and elevated 
concentrations of LTs are present in the upper airway lymphoid 
tissues of pediatric patients with SDB compared with those with 
recurrent tonsillitis, and propose that such differences could 
underlie the favorable response to LT modifier therapy. 

The conceptual premises under which therapy for SDB in 
children is based are not yet well defined. Indeed, although it 
has become increasingly apparent that SDB is associated with 
substantial morbidities, particularly affecting cognitive, behav-

ioral, and cardiovascular functions (5, 7, 8, 11, 13), the thresholds 
of disease severity that delineate the cost–benefit ratios for T&A, 
the primary line of treatment for pediatric SDB, are currently 
unknown. Thus, the recently published empirically based consensus 
guidelines that were developed for the treatment of SDB 
in children (12) do not mention any specific polysomnographic 
measures as firmly established criteria for T&A referral. As such, 
different pediatric sleep centers have adopted quite disparate 
obstructive AHI cut-off values for surgical treatment. Notwithstanding 
such uncertainties, when an AHI of greater than 5 
is present in snoring symptomatic children, this AHI value is 
consistently considered as a condition requiring T&A. Similarly, 
when an AHI of less than 1 is found during overnight sleep 
studies, patients are uniformly considered as having primary 
snoring and will not be viewed as candidates for any specific

treatment. However, substantial debate exists when an AHI of 
more than 1 but less than 5 is present in symptomatic children 
referred for evaluation of snoring (39). In this clinical setting, 
the mortality and morbidity of T&A need to be weighed against 
SDB-associated consequences, and the lack of evidence-based 
analyses makes this task particularly arduous. Therefore, although 
some professionals will opt for the surgical approach, 
others will withhold any intervention. Such considerations have 
led to the search for nonsurgical therapeutic alternatives. Sys


temic steroids were initially explored, but failed to yield any 
substantial benefits (40). In contrast, topical intranasal application 
of high-potency corticosteroids revealed significant improvements 
in AHI and oxygenation in a cohort of children with 
SDB (AHI . 
5) (14). Unfortunately, this latter study did not 
examine the role of topical steroids in children with mild SDB 
(1 . 
AHI . 
5), even if the expression pattern of glucocorticoid 
receptors suggests a favorable therapeutic profile for adenotonsillar 
tissue in children with SDB (41).

Leukotriene 
Modifier 
Therapy 
for 
Mild 
SDB 



The current study opens a new therapeutic modality for symptomatic 
pediatric patients with mild SDB. Indeed, we have now 
confirmed and further expanded on the enhanced expression 
levels of LT receptors in the upper lymphoid tissues of patients 
with SA (29). Furthermore, we now show that LT concentrations 
in such tissues are also increased, indicating that an active inflammatory 
process is present in the upper airway of these children, 
and that the coordinated increase in LT production and 
receptor expression may underlie signaling pathways leading to 
proliferation and hyperplasia of the lymphoid tissue in these 
children. Thus, if these biological processes are indeed pathophysiologically 
relevant to the increased size of adenotonsillar 
tissue, treatment with LT receptor blockers should abrogate the 
proliferative signals, and thereby lead to progressive reductions 
in overall lymphoid tissue volume within the upper airway, thus 
ameliorating the respiratory disturbances during sleep (42). 

Montelukast, a selective LT1-R blocker, is now a widely used 
and safe pharmacologic option in the treatment of asthma and 
allergic rhinitis in children. The recent cloning of the human 
genes for LT1-R (27) and LT2-R (28), and the subsequent generation 
of antibodies to their cognate proteins, enabled us to explore 
the differential expression patterns of these receptors in 
upper airway lymphoid tissues (29). We found that the expression 
of LT receptors is higher in patients with SDB. Furthermore, 
we describe how LT1-R is primarily expressed in myeloperoxidase-
positive cells within upper airway lymphoid tissues in children 
with SDB. The rather selective and peripheral location of 
LT1-R in relation to germinal centers within the tonsils suggests 
that either LT1-R expression occurred during late stages of maturation 
of lymphoid tissue or, as proposed by others, LT1-R–positive 
cells may have migrated from the vasculature to occupy 
their sites within the tonsils (43). Notwithstanding such considerations, 
the overarching concept emanating from this study supports 
the existence of a chronic inflammatory process in children 
with SDB. Indeed, C-reactive protein serum levels, an important 
systemic marker for inflammation, may be elevated in both children 
and adults with SA (20, 44, 45), even though this finding 
may not be consistently observed (46). Such elevations of 
C-reactive protein suggest that systemic processes may either 
initiate or maintain the localized inflammatory process and associated 
proliferative signaling within upper airway lymphoid tissues. 
In addition, inflammatory changes in the upper airway 
mucosa elicited by the recurrent vibratory mechanical stress of 
snoring could also contribute to the upregulation of LT receptor 
expression, and to the accelerated growth of the adenotonsillar 
tissues. Some corroboration to the slow, albeit progressive nature 
of these processes is exemplified by the relatively small, albeit 
significant increases in respiratory disturbance during sleep in 
the cohort of historical control children who received no treatment. 
In contrast, we observed statistically significant improvements 
in airway patency, as documented by the substantial

changes in the adenoidal/nasopharyngeal ratio and by the parallel 
small but significant reductions in respiratory-related sleep 
disturbances, after a 16-week course of oral montelukast therapy. 
It is likely that, based on the LT2-R expression patterns found 
herein and the modifying role that LT2-R has on LT1-R function 
(47), implementation of combined therapy using both LT1-R 
and LT2-R blockers may be even more effective in reducing the 
size of lymphoid tissue in children with SDB. Although it is 
evident that randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trials 
are needed to confirm our current findings, and further define 
the optimal duration of therapy and improved delineation of the 
patient population most likely to benefit from LT1-R antagonist 
therapy, the present study clearly establishes the beneficial role 
of montelukast therapy as a nonsurgical alternative for symptomatic 
children with mild SDB. 

In summary, we have delineated the expression of LT receptor 
and LT levels in the upper airway lymphoid tissue of children 
with SDB. Although double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are 
clearly needed to corroborate our findings, the use of LT receptor 
antagonists emerges as a potential therapeutic consideration in 
children with mild SDB.
