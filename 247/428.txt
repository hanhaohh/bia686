Aim:To review 66 children with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) for whom a trial of nasal continuous 
positive airway pressure (nCPAP) was proposed. 
Methods: 
Baseline sleep studies were performed to assess OSA severity; a trial of nCPAP was 
performed where moderate to severe OSA, not relieved by adenotonsillectomy, was found. The nCPAP 
trial was considered either technically successful (ST), if the child accepted the mask for sufficient time 
to determine nCPAP efficacy, or a technical failure (FT) if otherwise. Patients with an initial FT were 
offered a period of home acclimatisation to familiarise them with wearing the mask during sleep. ST 
patients in whom nCPAP was effective were established on long term therapy. 
Results:Nasal CPAP trials were successful (ST) in 49/66 (74%) patients. Nasal CPAP efficacy could 
not be determined in the remaining 17 FT patients (26%), generally because of their poor nCPAP tolerance. 
These patients were subsequently considered for other treatment. A total of 42/49 (86%) ST

continuous 
positive 
airway 
pressure 
(nCPAP) 
for 
the 
treatment 
of 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnoea 
syndrome 
(OSA) 
was 
first 
described 
in 
1981,1 
and 
is 
now 
widely 
accepted 
as 
the 
first 
line 
therapy 
in 
adult 
patients.2 
CPAP 
acts 
as 
a 
pneumatic 
splint 
to 
the 
upper 
airway, 
serving 
to 
maintain 
airway 
patency, 
preventing 
the 
airway 
collapse 
associated 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnoea. 
The 
first 
reported 
use 
in 
children 
was 
in 
1984, 
when 
Schmidt-Nowara 
described 
a 
single 
case 
where 
nCPAP 
was 
successfully 
used 
for 
one 
year.3 
Two 
years 
later, 
Guilleminault 
et 
al 
proposed 
nCPAP 
as 
an 
alternative 
treatment 
to 
tracheostomy 
for 
children 
with 
medical 
conditions 
such 
as 
craniofacial 
anomalies 
or 
neuromuscular 
disorders 
in 
which 
(OSA) 
was 
not 
abolished 
by 
adenotonsillectomy.4 
Over 
the 
intervening 
years 
there 
has 
been 
an 
increase 
in 
nCPAP 
use 
in 
children.5–15 
The 
consensus 
of 
these 
studies 
is 
that 
nCPAP 
is 
both 
effective 
and 
well 
tolerated 
in 
more 
than 
80% 
of 
children11 
12; 
in 
general, 
only 
minor 
side 
effects 
(nasal 
symptoms, 
air 
leaks, 
and 
skin 
breakdown) 
have 
been 
reported.12 
15 
However, 
there 
are 
case 
reports 
of 
patients 
in 
whom 
hypoventilation11 
and 
midface 
hypoplasia16 
have 
been 
found 
with 
nCPAP 
therapy. 
Follow 
up 
nCPAP 
assessments 
are 
recommended 
every 
6–12 
months, 
as 
mask 
size 
and 
effective 
nCPAP 
pressure 
are 
likely 
to 
change 
with 
growth.12

Figure 
1 
shows 
a 
young 
child 
with 
nasal 
CPAP 
equipment 
in 
situ. 
Nasal 
CPAP 
is 
primarily 
used 
in 
children 
with 
medical 
conditions 
such 
as 
craniofacial 
anomalies, 
neuromuscular 
disorders, 
genetic 
syndromes, 
skeletal 
dysplasia, 
and 
obesity, 
in 
which 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
is 
not 
cured 
by 
adenotonsillectomy.18 
Additionally, 
nCPAP 
can 
be 
used 
in 
the 
preoperative 
period 
to 
stabilise 
children 
at 
risk 
of 
respiratory 
compromise 
for 
adenotonsillectomy, 
or 
as 
an 
interim 
treat


ment 
while 
dental 
and 
facial 
growth 
are 
completed 
and 
craniofacial 
surgery 
can 
be 
performed.18–20 


Compliance 
in 
children, 
described 
in 
terms 
of 
nCPAP 
use 
as 
a 
percentage 
of 
hours 
prescribed, 
has 
been 
estimated 
as 
50–100%,21 
and 
seems 
to 
be 
related 
to 
the 
routine 
of 
home 
environment 
and 
care 
givers,22 
but 
limited 
objective 
data 
are 
available. 
To 
our 
knowledge, 
large 
studies 
on 
nCPAP 
in 
children 
with 
OSA 
have 
been 
reported 
mainly 
from 
the 
United 
States 
and 
Australia,5111215 
with 
a 
larger 
number 
of 
single 
cases 
reported 
or 
in 
abstract 
form 
only.3 
6–10 
There 
are 
also 
a 
number 
of 
large 
studies 
referring 
specifically 
to 
the 
use 
of 
nCPAP 
to 
treat 
infantile 
sleep 
apnoea.5 
23–25 
The 
purpose 
of 
the 
present 
report 
was 
to 
describe 
our 
experience 
with 
nCPAP 
in 
children 
with 
OSA, 
as 
an 
example 
of 
a 
European 
experience. 


METHODS 


The 
data 
in 
this 
report 
are 
from 
the 
patient 
records 
of 
the 
Great 
Ormond 
Street 
Hospital 
Sleep 
Disorders 
Unit 
from 
1994 
to 
1999. 
Every 
child 
that 
was 
diagnosed 
with 
moderate 
to 
severe 
OSA 
and 
in 
whom 
a 
nCPAP 
trial 
was 
suggested 
has 
been 
included. 
Treatment 
with 
nCPAP 
was 
recommended 
in 
children 
where 
surgical 
treatment 
of 
OSA 
was 
not 
possible. 
Patients 
using 
nCPAP 
for 
conditions 
other 
than 
OSA 
(for 
example, 
respiratory 
failure) 
have 
not 
been 
included.

Use of nasal CPAP to treat obstructive sleep apnoea 


Figure 
1 
An infant undergoing a sleep study with nasal CPAP. The 
CPAP mask consists a rigid plastic frame with a soft silicone nasal 
cushion. The mask is held in place over the nose by a set of 
headgear with a three-point fixing to the mask frame using 
adjustable Velcro straps. The CPAP pressure is applied from a flow 
generator located at the cot side (out of picture) via the corrugated 
tubing, seen to the patient’s right. Mask pressure is monitored during 
the CPAP trial via the narrow manometer tubing connected to the 
CPAP mask. The respiband monitoring respiratory movements is 
evident round the chest, an oximeter probe is attached to the right 
foot, and the ECG leads can be seen exiting from the child’s clothes. 

Sleep 
studies 


Overnight 
sleep 
studies 
were 
performed 
on 
the 
respiratory 
ward 
and 
commenced 
at 
the 
child’s 
usual 
bedtime. 
Studies 
ranged 
in 
duration 
between 
6 
and 
10 
hours 
and 
were 
supervised 
by 
an 
experienced 
sleep 
technician 
or 
nurse 
to 
ensure 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
recordings. 
Diagnostic 
studies 
included 
measurement 
of: 
electrocardiogram 
(ECG), 
arterial 
oxygen 
saturation 
(SpO2; 
Ohmeda 
Biox) 
from 
a 
flexible 
probe 
attached 
to 
the 
finger 
or 
toe, 
thoracic 
and 
abdominal 
respiratory 
movements 
(strain 
gauges), 
and 
oronasal 
airflow 
via 
thermistor. 
A 
video 
(infrared 
camera) 
and 
sound 
recording 
was 
also 
made. 
Obstructive 
apnoea 
events, 
defined 
by 
the 
presence 
of 
chest 
and 
abdominal 
wall 
motion 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
airflow 
longer 
than 
two 
breath 
cycles, 
were 
counted.26 
27 
The 
obstructive 
apnoea 
index 
was 
defined 
as 
the 
mean 
number 
of 
obstructive 
apnoeas 
per 
hour 
of 
sleep. 
Oximetry 
artefacts 
in 
the 
pulse 
waveform 
tracing 
were 
discarded 
manually 
following 
visual 
inspection 
of 
the 
traces. 
The 
mean 
and 
nadir 
SpO2 
values 
were 
determined. 
Oxyhaemoglobin 
desaturation 
episodes 
were 
defined 
as 
periods 
associated 
with 
a 
>4% 
reduction 
from 
the 
prior 
10 
second 
baseline. 
Reductions 
in 
SpO2 
were 
reported 
as 
indices 
(for 
example, 
the 
number 
of 
events 
per 
hour 
of 
total 
sleep 
time). 
Because 
of 
the 
absence 
of 
electroencephalographic 
facilities 
in 
the 
polysomnograms 
used 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
survey 
(Visilab 
II, 
SSI 
Oxford 
UK, 
and 
CARDAS, 
Oxford 
UK), 
sleep 
stages 
were 
defined 
as 
either 
wake, 
quiet 
sleep 
(QS), 
or 
active 
sleep 
(AS) 
based 
on 
the 
presence 
of 
movements, 
heart 
rate 
variability, 
and 
by 
reference 
to 
the 
video 
record. 


Full 
polysomnography 
remains 
the 
gold 
standard 
for 
diagnostic 
investigation, 
but 
universally 
accepted 
diagnostic 
criteria 
for 
OSA 
in 
children 
are 
lacking 
and 
normative 
data 
are 
limited.26–29 
Based 
on 
our 
own 
laboratory 
criteria, 
we 
considered 
a 
child 
having 
moderate 
to 
severe 
OSA 
when 
one 
or 
more 
of 
the 
following 
criteria 
were 
met26: 


(1) 
Obstructive 
apnoea 
index 
>5 
events 
per 
hour 
(2) 
Desaturation 
index 
>4 
events 
per 
hour 
with 
episodes 
of 
desaturation 
longer 
than 
10 
seconds 
and 
SpO2 
nadir 
less 
than 
90%. 
Other 
evidence 
supporting 
the 
diagnosis 
of 
OSA 
came 
from 
direct 
observations 
of 
the 
patient 
or 
from 
the 
review 
of 
the 
videotape 
and 
included: 


(1) 
Pronounced 
snoring 
for 
more 
than 
50% 
of 
the 
night 
(2) 
Laboured 
breathing 
indicated 
by 
notable 
paradoxical 
inward 
movement 
of 
the 
chest, 
sternal 
retractions, 
or 
use 
of 
the 
accessory 
muscles 
of 
respiration 
(3) 
Frequent 
awakening 
from 
sleep 
associated 
with 
snoring, 
increasing 
respiratory 
effort, 
and 
partial 
obstruction. 
Nasal 
CPAP 
trial 


An 
nCPAP 
trial 
was 
performed 
during 
a 
second 
overnight 
sleep 
study, 
under 
the 
close 
supervision 
of 
a 
trained 
observer, 
to 
establish 
the 
efficacy 
of 
the 
therapy 
and 
to 
allow 
any 
practical 
problems 
with 
mask 
fitting 
or 
attachment 
to 
be 
corrected. 
The 
nCPAP 
trial 
was 
a 
split 
night 
study, 
with 
the 
initial 
part 
of 
the 
night 
off 
nCPAP 
to 
confirm 
the 
previous 
diagnosis, 
and 
the 
second 
part 
of 
the 
night 
with 
the 
nCPAP 
equipment 
fitted 
to 
the 
child. 
Titration 
of 
the 
nCPAP 
pressure 
commenced 
at 
the 
lowest 
pressure 
(4 
cm 
H2O) 
and 
involved 
gradually 
increasing 
the 
pressure 
by 
small 
(generally 
2 
cm 
H2O) 
increments 
until 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnoea 
and 
oxyhaemoglobin 
desaturation 
were 
overcome. 
In 
practice, 
there 
is 
a 
notable 
change 
in 
the 
child’s 
breathing 
pattern 
as 
soon 
as 
an 
effective 
pressure 
is 
reached. 
Breathing 
becomes 
less 
laboured, 
snoring 
stops, 
arousals 
are 
diminished, 
and 
SpO2 
stabilises. 
An 
nCPAP 
trial 
was 
considered 
successful 
(ST) 
if 
the 
child 
was 
cooperative 
in 
wearing 
the 
mask 
for 
the 
time 
necessary 
to 
define 
nCPAP 
efficacy; 
a 
failed 
trial 
(FT) 
was 
defined 
when 
the 
child 
did 
not 
tolerate 
the 
mask 
for 
the 
necessary 
time 
to 
define 
efficacy 
of 
the 
therapy. 
Nasal 
CPAP 
could 
only 
be 
classed 
as 
successful 
if 
it 
was 
shown 
to 
be 
effective 
in 
both 
quiet 
sleep 
(approximating 
to 
deep 
sleep 
stages) 
and 
active 
sleep 
(including 
REM 
sleep 
periods). 
The 
time 
taken 
to 
achieve 
a 
decision 
on 
nCPAP 
efficacy 
was 
2–4 
hours 
with 
nCPAP 
in 
place 
and 
depended 
on 
the 
level 
of 
nCPAP 
required 
and 
the 
pattern 
of 
the 
sleep 
states 
of 
the 
individual. 


Children 
in 
whom 
nCPAP 
was 
accepted 
and 
found 
to 
be 
effective 
were 
sent 
home 
with 
the 
appropriate 
equipment. 
Parents 
received 
a 
detailed 
explanation 
about 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnoea, 
the 
need 
for 
treatment, 
and 
how 
the 
nCPAP 
system 
works. 
Telephone 
support, 
for 
any 
problems 
arising 
or 
for 
equipment 
replacement 
parts, 
was 
also 
given 
to 
the 
families. 
Follow 
up 
sleep 
studies 
and 
clinical 
assessments 
were 
performed 
at 
one 
month, 
six 
month, 
and 
one 
year 
intervals 
in 
order 
to 
evaluate 
the 
continued 
effectiveness 
of 
nCPAP, 
to 
readjust 
the 
mask 
size, 
and 
to 
change 
the 
pressure 
level 
where 
necessary. 
On 
each 
occasion, 
information 
regarding 
problems, 
side 
effects, 
and 
compliance 
were 
obtained 
from 
parents. 


Home 
acclimatisation 


For 
patients 
in 
whom 
the 
nCPAP 
trial 
was 
unsuccessful, 
a 
period 
of 
home 
acclimatisation 
to 
the 
nCPAP 
equipment 
was 
necessary 
before 
attempting 
the 
nCPAP 
trial 
a 
second 
time. 
For 
selected 
families 
or 
patients, 
a 
period 
of 
acclimatisation 
to 
the 
nCPAP 
equipment 
was 
necessary 
even 
before 
attempting 
the 
first 
nCPAP 
trial 
itself. 
Home 
acclimatisation 
involved 
the 
progressive 
introduction, 
by 
parents, 
of 
nCPAP 
to 
the 
child, 
using 
the 
following 
stages: 


(1) 
Use 
of 
the 
nCPAP 
mask 
alone 
(without 
tubing) 
with 
the 
parents 
introducing 
the 
mask 
during 
daytime 
play 
until 
the 
child 
was 
able 
to 
wear 
the 
open 
mask 
without 
distress. 
(2) 
Encouraging 
the 
child 
to 
go 
to 
sleep 
wearing 
the 
open 
mask. 
To 
minimise 
any 
dangers 
of 
hypercapnia 
from 
rebreathing, 
the 
mask 
was 
used 
with 
all 
the 
ports 
open 
(no 
tubing 
attached) 
and 
was 
removed 
by 
the 
parents 
shortly 
after 
the 
child 
fell 
asleep. 
(3) 
Once 
the 
child 
was 
able 
to 
wear 
the 
mask 
to 
go 
to 
sleep, 
nCPAP 
was 
introduced 
at 
the 
lowest 
pressure 
setting 
(4 
cm 
H2O). 
Once 
this 
stage 
was 
reached 
at 
home 
a 
formal 
nCPAP 
trial 
was 
arranged 
in 
the 
hospital.

nCPAP 
equipment 


The 
system 
used 
in 
the 
present 
study 
was 
the 
Sullivan-III 
nCPAP 
system 
(ResMed; 
Abingdon, 
UK) 
with 
the 
machine 
connected

RESULTS 
Patient 
details 


Data 
were 
obtained 
from 
66 
patients, 
39 
(59%) 
boys 
and 
27 
(41%) 
girls. 
At 
the 
time 
of 
the 
diagnostic 
sleep 
study, 
18 
(27.3%) 
patients 
were 
less 
than 
1 
year, 
28 
(42.4%) 
were 
aged 
1–5 
years, 
12 
(18.2%) 
were 
aged 
6–12 
years, 
and 
eight 
(12.1%) 
were 
aged 
13–19 
years.

Nasal 
CPAP 
trial 
history 


Figure 
2 
shows 
the 
nCPAP 
trial 
histories 
of 
the 
66 
patients. 


Of 
66 
children 
selected 
for 
a 
nCPAP 
trial, 
64 
(97%) 
underwent 
a 
first 
nCPAP 
trial 
in 
the 
hospital 
to 
define 
the 
efficacy 
of 
the 
therapy, 
while 
for 
two 
patients 
(3%), 
a 
period 
of 
home 
acclimatisation 
prior 
to 
nCPAP 
trial 
was 
chosen 
by 
physicians, 
because 
of 
low 
acceptance 
of 
the 
therapy 
by 
the 
parents. 
After 
a 
period 
of 
time, 
4–6 
months, 
these 
two 
families 
returned 
the 
machine 
to 
the 
hospital, 
reporting 
insurmountable 
difficulties 
in 
adapting 
the 
child 
to 
the 
therapy. 
Because 


both 
children 
were 
at 
high 
risk 
of 
respiratory 
compromise 
for 
adenotonsillectomy 
and 
too 
young 
to 
have 
craniofacial 
surgery 
performed, 
the 
parents 
were 
strongly 
encouraged 
to 
continue 
with 
a 
further 
period 
of 
home 
acclimatisation, 
but 
despite 
this, 
success 
was 
not 
achieved. 
One 
of 
the 
two 
patients 
underwent 
adenotonsillectomy 
one 
year 
later, 
but 
a 
following 
sleep 
study 
showed 
incomplete 
resolution 
of 
obstruction. 
The 
other 
patient 
is 
under 
regular 
follow 
up 
until 
craniofacial 
surgery 
can 
be 
performed. 


Of 
the 
64 
children 
who 
underwent 
the 
first 
nCPAP 
trial, 
43 
(67.2%) 
had 
a 
successful 
trial 
(ST) 
in 
that 
they 
tolerated 
the 
mask 
and 
nCPAP 
was 
shown 
to 
be 
effective. 
Twenty 
one 
(32.8%) 
were 
reluctant 
to 
wear 
the 
mask 
during 
the 
nCPAP 
trial, 
making 
it 
impossible 
to 
define 
nCPAP 
efficacy. 
For 
these 
children 
a 
period 
of 
home 
acclimatisation 
was 
proposed; 
this 
was 
accepted 
by 
14 
of 
the 
families 
(66.7%) 
and 
refused 
by 
seven 
(33.3%). 
Of 
these 
seven 
children, 
two 
had 
a 
nasopharyngeal 
tube 
inserted 
and 
were 
given 
supplemental 
oxygen, 
one 
underwent 
craniofacial 
advancement 
surgery 
when 
facial 
growth 
was 
completed, 
and 
three 
were 
lost 
to 
follow 
up. 


From 
the 
14 
patients 
on 
home 
acclimatisation, 
nine 
(64.3%) 
came 
back 
for 
subsequent 
nCPAP 
trial 
when 
they 
were 
able 
to 
tolerate 
the 
lowest 
pressure 
at 
home, 
while 
the 
remaining 
five 
failed 
to 
be 
acclimatised, 
with 
parents 
reporting 
continuing 
difficulties 
adapting 
the 
child 
to 
the 
therapy. 
Of 
these 
five 
children, 
two 
were 
given 
supplemental 
oxygen, 
two 
were 
treated 
with 
nasal 
steroids 
until 
craniofacial 
surgery 
could 
be 
performed, 
and 
one 
was 
lost 
to 
follow 
up. 


Of 
the 
nine 
children 
that 
underwent 
a 
second 
nCPAP 
trial, 
four 
(44.4%) 
tolerated 
the 
mask; 
nCPAP 
was 
shown 
to 
be 
successful 
and 
they 
went 
home 
on 
therapy. 
Five 
subjects 
(55.6%) 
still 
refused 
to 
wear 
the 
mask 
during 
the 
trial 
and 
awoke 
distressed 
at 
any 
attempts 
made, 
making 
it 
impossible 
to 
verify 
nCPAP 
efficacy. 


Of 
43 
children 
in 
whom 
the 
first 
nCPAP 
trial 
was 
successful, 
36 
were 
started 
on 
long 
term 
therapy 
at 
home.

Flow diagram showing the history of 66 patients with OSA in which an nCPAP trial was suggested. The outlined boxes indicate the 
patients that were established on nCPAP therapy at home. For children that failed to be treated with nCPAP, alternative treatments such as 
nasopharyngeal prong, supplemental oxygen, and craniofacial surgery were used. One child underwent tracheostomy for acute respiratory 
failure and was subsequently ventilated with BiPAP via tracheostomy. One child underwent adenotonsillectomy after a period of stabilisation 
with CPAP. 

although 
nCPAP 
was 
effective 
and 
the 
child 
accepted 
the 
mask 
during 
the 
trial, 
parents 
subsequently 
declined 
to 
continue 
the 
therapy 
as 
a 
long 
term 
treatment. 
Two 
of 
these 
patients 
had 
a 
nasopharyngeal 
tube 
inserted 
while 
a 
further 
three 
were 
lost 
to 
follow 
up. 
In 
two 
subjects 
(4.7%) 
nCPAP 
was 
found 
to 
be 
ineffective 
in 
alleviating 
the 
obstruction. 
One 
of 
them 
subsequently 
died 
as 
a 
result 
of 
exacerbation 
of 
his 
primary 
medical 
condition; 
the 
other 
was 
assessed 
for 
possible 
craniofacial 
surgery. 


Excluding 
the 
two 
subjects 
in 
whom 
nCPAP 
was 
not 
effective, 
no 
statistically 
significant 
differences 
were 
found 
in 
terms 
of 
age, 
sex, 
or 
diagnosis, 
between 
the 
42 
children 
that 
finally 
accepted 
nCPAP 
therapy 
and 
the 
22 
children 
that, 
even 
after 
several 
attempts, 
refused 
to 
accept 
the 
therapy 
(table 
2). 
Nevertheless, 
the 
highest 
proportion 
of 
the 
successful 
trials 
were 
achieved 
in 
children 
less 
than 
1 
year, 
and 
those 
older 
than 
5, 
with 
consistently 
lower 
success 
rates 
in 
children 
between 
1 
and 
5 
years 
old 
(fig 
3). 


Long 
term 
nCPAP 
use 


Of 
the 
49 
patients 
that 
completed 
the 
nCPAP 
trial 
successfully, 
42 
(86%) 
were 
established 
on 
long 
term 
nCPAP 
therapy. 
They 
have 
used 
nCPAP 
for 
a 
mean 
(SD) 
of 
2.5 
(1.8) 
years, 
ranging 
from 
2 
months 
to 
6.5 
years, 
with 
69% 
of 
children 
using 
nCPAP 


for 
more 
than 
one 
year. 
At 
the 
time 
of 
the 
study, 
31 
patients 
(73.8%) 
had 
continuously 
used 
the 
therapy 
at 
home, 
while 
11 
(26.2%) 
had 
interrupted 
the 
therapy. 
Of 
these, 
three 
had 
discontinued 
nCPAP 
during 
an 
admission 
for 
craniofacial 
surgery, 
one 
had 
a 
tracheostomy 
for 
acute 
respiratory 
failure 
but 
continued 
to 
be 
ventilated 
with 
BiPAP 
via 
tracheostomy, 
two 
subsequently 
died 
as 
a 
result 
of

primary 
medical 
condition, 
one 
had 
adenotonsillectomy, 
and 
one 
infant 
improved 
after 
one 
year 
of 
treatment. 
The 
longest 
duration 
of 
nCPAP 
therapy 
has 
been 
6 
years 
and 
6 
months 
in 
a 
boy 
who 
commenced 
nCPAP 
at 
the 
age 
of 
4 
years. 
Only 
three 
patients 
discontinued 
their 
therapy

DISCUSSION 


We 
have 
described 
our 
experience 
using 
nCPAP 
to 
treat 
children 
with 
OSA. 
In 
our 
study, 
nCPAP 
was 
effective 
and 
tolerated 
by 
86% 
of 
children; 
a 
period 
of 
acclimatisation 
in 
the 
home 
environment 
was 
found 
to 
be 
a 
useful 
strategy 
to 
achieve 
success 
in 
26% 
of 
patients 
in 
whom 
initial 
assessments 
were 
not 
possible 
because 
of 
intolerance 
of 
nCPAP. 


Experiences 
with 
nCPAP 
in 
children 
have 
been 
published 
mainly 
from 
the 
United 
States4–8 
12 
15–17 
and 
Australia,3911 
while 
limited 
published 
data 
are 
available 
from 
Europe.13 
The 
only 
UK 
report 
on 
paediatric 
patients 
was 
published 
by 
our 
group 
in 
1996,13 
and 
referred 
to 
the 
use 
of 
nCPAP 
in 
children 
with 
craniofacial 
dysostoses. 
In 
the 
present 
study 
we 
report 
our 
experience 
with 
nCPAP 
on 
a 
wider 
group 
of 
paediatric 
patients. 
In 
common 
with 
Waters 
et 
al 
and 
Marcus 
and 
coworkers,11 
12 
we 
found 
an 
overall 
success 
rate 
of 
more 
than 
80%, 
with 
the 
main 
reason 
for 
non-acceptance 
of 
the 
therapy 
being 
poor 
patient 
compliance. 
Patients 
complained 
of 
frequent 
minor 
discomforts, 
but 
they 
responded 
to 
simple 


treatments 
such 
as 
a 
change 
of 
mask 
size 
or 
type, 
in 
case 
of 
forehead 
soreness 
or 
air 
leaks, 
the 
use 
of 
skin 
cream 
or 
protective 
tape 
to 
alleviate 
skin 
irritation, 
and 
passive 
humidification 
inserts 
in 
the 
case 
of 
nasal 
dryness. 
A 
period 
of 
acclimatisation 
in 
the 
home 
environment 
was 
useful 
to 
recuperate 
37.5% 
of 
patients, 
who 
would 
otherwise 
have 
been 
lost 
as 
a 
result 
of 
low 
compliance. 


The 
importance 
of 
a 
training 
programme 
to 
improve 
acceptance 
and 
tolerance 
to 
nCPAP 
in 
children, 
has 
been 
reported 
by 
Rains,22 
where 
four 
children 
participated 
with 
their 
parents 
in 
a 
behavioural 
intervention 
programme 
before 
they 
were 
discharged 
with 
nCPAP. 
That 
intervention 
resulted 
in 
all 
patients 
tolerating 
nCPAP 
from 
the 
second 
night 
of 
treatment. 
In 
our 
study, 
the 
majority 
of 
failures 
have 
been 
prior 
to 
starting 
the 
therapy, 
when 
parents 
and 
children 
have 
to 
adapt 
to 
nCPAP 
use, 
while 
few 
have 
discontinued 
nCPAP 
because 
of 
poor 
compliance 
after 
the 
child 
has 
started 
on 
therapy. 
One 
factor 
that 
might 
have 
been 
expected 
to 
effect 
the 
success 
of 
nCPAP 
trials 
was 
the 
child’s 
age. 
We 
found 
a 
higher 
rate 
of 
success 
in 
infants 
and 
in 
children 
over 
5 
years; 
for 
the 
intervening 
ages 
we 
found 
that 
the 
child 
frequently 
refused 
to 
wear 
the 
mask 
or 
to 
tolerate 
an 
applied 
pressure.

Use of nasal CPAP to treat obstructive sleep apnoea 

Our 
experience 
suggests 
that 
both 
parental 
determination 
and 
child 
cooperation 
are 
important 
to 
achieve 
success 
in 
this 
therapy. 
In 
12% 
of 
cases, 
where 
nCPAP 
was 
effective 
and 
tolerated 
by 
the 
child 
during 
the 
trial, 
parents 
subsequently 
refused 
to 
continue 
the 
therapy 
at 
home. 
In 
these 
cases, 
it 
seems 
likely 
that 
the 
parents’ 
poor 
perception 
of 
the 
need 
for, 
and 
benefits 
of 
nCPAP 
for 
their 
child, 
is 
the 
determining 
factor 
in 
the 
successful 
use 
of 
nCPAP 
in 
the 
long 
term. 
An 
advanced 
training 
programme 
for 
parents 
regarding 
(1) 
the 
importance 
of 
treating 
OSA 
to 
avoid 
the 
risk 
of 
complications, 


(2) 
the 
practical 
and 
simple 
use 
of 
nCPAP 
equipment, 
and 
(3) 
the 
behavioural 
management 
of 
the 
child’s 
resistance 
to 
wear 
the 
mask, 
may 
be 
a 
useful 
strategy 
to 
reduce 
these 
failures. 
Further 
research 
should 
evaluate 
how 
to 
improve 
the 
rate 
of 
success 
with 
nCPAP 
in 
children. 
From 
the 
group 
established 
on 
long 
term 
therapy, 
only 
one 
patient 
(who 
was 
an 
infant) 
has 
improved 
sufficiently 
to 
allow 
nCPAP 
therapy 
to 
be 
discontinued. 
It 
has 
been 
reported 
that 
nCPAP 
may 
be 
easier 
to 
discontinue 
over 
time 
in 
infants 
than 
in 
older 
children.20 
Regular 
follow 
up 
assessments 
are 
needed 
to 
investigate 
the 
possibility 
of 
weaning 
these 
patients 
off 
nCPAP. 


Compliance 
in 
terms 
of 
nCPAP 
use, 
as 
a 
percentage 
of 
hours 
prescribed, 
has 
been 
estimated 
at 
50–100%, 
with 
adolescents 
the 
least 
compliant,12 
15 
21 
but 
objective 
data 
are 
lacking. 
We 
found 
that 
67.7% 
of 
children 
were 
reported 
to 
use 
nCPAP 
regularly, 
while 
the 
others 
were 
reported 
to 
wear 
CPAP 
every 
night 
but 
sometimes 
remove 
the 
mask 
during 
sleep. 
These 
data 
are 
from 
parental 
reports, 
so 
need 
to 
be 
verified. 
Most 
CPAP 
devices 
today 
have 
a 
clock 
time 
counter 
incorporated 
that 
allows 
reading 
of 
the 
hours 
of 
use 
of 
the 
machine. 
Regrettably, 
the 
present 
retrospective 
study 
did 
not 
have 
complete 
records 
of 
counter 
readings. 
It 
would 
be 
desirable 
to 
have 
further 
prospective 
studies 
to 
evaluate 
the 
objective 
compliance 
with 
nCPAP 
in 
children 
and 
the 
reliability 
of 
parent 
reports. 


Conclusion 


We 
have 
been 
able 
to 
achieve 
similar 
success 
rates 
for 
the 
use 
of 
nCPAP 
as 
a 
treatment 
in 
children 
with 
OSA 
as 
those 
reported 
from 
outside 
the 
UK. 
It 
is 
possible 
to 
use 
nCPAP 
in 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
ages, 
from 
young 
babies 
through 
to 
older 
children, 
either 
as 
a 
primary 
treatment 
or 
as 
a 
bridge 
therapy 
in 
patients 
at 
high 
risk 
for 
surgery. 
In 
order 
to 
improve 
the 
success 
rate 
for 
nCPAP, 
there 
needs 
to 
be 
a 
focus 
on 
education 
and 
motivation 
of 
the 
parents 
to 
convince 
them 
of 
the 
efficacy 
and 
safety 
of 
nCPAP 
in 
order 
to 
reduce 
the 
number 
of 
failures.
