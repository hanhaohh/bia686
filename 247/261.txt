ABSTRACT 


OBJECTIVE. 
The 
goal 
was 
to 
determine 
whether 
amelioration 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
through 
adenotonsillectomy 
would 
reduce 
middle 
cerebral 
artery 
velocity 
in 
parallel 
with 
improvements 
in 
cognition 
and 
behavior. 


METHODS. 
For 
19 
children 
(mean 
age: 
6 
years) 
with 
mild 
sleep-disordered 
breathing, 
and 
14 
healthy, 
ethnically 
similar 
and 
age-similar, 
control 
subjects, 
parents 
repeated 
the 
Pediatric 
Sleep 
Questionnaire 
an 
average 
of 
12 
months 
after 
adenotonsillectomy. 
Children 
with 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
underwent 
repeated 
overnight 
measurement 
of 
mean 
oxyhemoglobin 
saturation. 
Neurobehavioral 
tests 
that 
yielded 
significant 
group 
differences 
preoperatively 
were 
readministered. 
Middle 
cerebral 
artery 
velocity 
measurements 
were 
repeated 
with 
blinding 
to 
sleep 
study 
and 
neuropsychological 
results, 
and 
mixed-design 
analyses 
of 
variance 
were 
performed. 


RESULTS. 
The 
median 
Pediatric 
Sleep 
Questionnaire 
score 
significantly 
improved 
postoperatively, 
and 
there 
was 
a 
significant 
increase 
in 
mean 
overnight 
oxyhemoglobin 
saturation. 
The 
middle 
cerebral 
artery 
velocity 
decreased 
in 
the 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
group 
postoperatively, 
whereas 
control 
subjects 
showed 
a 
slight 
increase. 
A 
preoperative 
group 
difference 
was 
reduced 
by 
the 
postoperative 
assessment, 
which 
suggests 
normalization 
of 
middle 
cerebral 
artery 
velocity 
in 
those 
with 
sleep-disordered 
breathing. 
The 
increase 
in 
mean 
overnight 
oxyhemoglobin 
saturation 
postoperatively 
was 
associated 
with 
a 
reduction 
in 
middle 
cerebral 
artery 
velocity 
in 
a 
subgroup 
of 
children. 
A 
preoperative 
group 
difference 
in 
processing 
speed 
was 
reduced 
postoperatively. 
Similarly, 
a 
trend 
for 
a 
preoperative 
group 
difference 
in 
visual 
attention 
was 
reduced 
postoperatively. 
Executive 
function 
remained 
significantly 
worse 
for 
the 
children 
with 
sleep-disordered 
breathing, 
compared 
with 
control 
subjects, 
although 
mean 
postoperative 
scores 
were 
lower 
than 
preoperative 
scores. 


CONCLUSIONS. 
Otherwise-healthy 
young 
children 
with 
apparently 
mild 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
have 
potentially 
reversible 
cerebral 
hemodynamic 
and 
neurobehavioral 
changes.

CHILDHOOD 
SLEEP-DISORDERED 
BREATHING 
(SDB) 
describes 
a 
spectrum 
of 
upper-airway 
obstruction 
from 
primary 
snoring, 
which 
is 
reported 
for 
10% 
of 
preschool-aged 
children,1 
to 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea, 
with 
reported 
community 
prevalence 
rates 
of 
0.9% 
to 
4.3%.2,3 
Obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
is 
characterized 
by 
repetitive 
partial 
(hypopnea) 
or 
complete 
(apnea) 
collapse 
of 
the 
pharyngeal 
airway 
despite 
continued 
respiratory 
effort. 
Nocturnal 
apnea 
and 
hypopnea 
can 
result 
in 
episodic 
hypoxic 
hypercapnia, 
as 
well 
as 
repetitive 
arousals 
from 
sleep, 
which 
fragment 
sleep 
architecture. 
Disproportional 
adenotonsillar 
growth, 
relative 
to 
airway 
caliber,4 
is 
the 
major 
causative 
factor 
in 
childhood, 
although 
body 
mass, 
neuromuscular 
control, 
and 
craniofacial 
anatomic 
features 
may 
contribute. 
It 
is 
well 
established 
that 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
in 
adults 
is 
a 
risk 
factor 
for 
cardiovascular 
and 
cerebrovascular 
disease 
and 
death.5 
There 
is 
evidence 
that 
pediatric 
SDB 
is 
similarly 
associated 
with 
cardiovascular 
morbidity.6

interest 
in 
cerebrovascular 
health 
in 
such

although 
these 
data 
might 
be 
uniquely 
informative 
for 
determining 
the 
relative 
importance 
of 
SDB.11 
An 
association 
between 
nocturnal 
oxyhemoglobin 
desaturation 
and 
central 
nervous 
system 
event 
risk 
in 
sickle 
cell 
disease, 
the 
most-common 
cause 
of 
childhood 
stroke,12 
has 
been 
documented, 
but 
it 
is 
not 
clear 
whether 
a 
similar 
relationship 
exists 
in 
asymptomatic 
children. 
We 
recently 
described 
significantly 
increased 
middle 
cerebral 
artery 
blood 
flow 
velocity 
(MCAV) 
in 
young 
children 
with 
mild 
SDB.13 
These 
children 
were 
regular 
snorers 
with 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy 
deemed 
to 
require 
surgery 
on 
clinical 
grounds, 
and 
all 
had 
an 
apnea/hypopnea 
index 
(AHI) 
of 
5 
events 
per 
hour 
of 
sleep. 
Increased 
MCAV 
presented 
alongside 
reductions 
in 
processing 
speed 
and 
visual 
attention 
and 
parental 
reports 
of 
executive 
function 
deficits. 
Consistent 
with 
earlier 
research,14,15 
we 
concluded 
that 
there 
are 
detrimental 
effects 
of 
mild 
SDB 
on 
cognitive 
and 
behavioral 
function 
in 
children 
and 
that 
such 
changes 
present 
alongside 
altered 
cerebral 
hemodynamic 
function. 


In 
the 
present 
study, 
we 
describe 
follow-up 
MCAV, 
cognitive, 
and 
behavioral 
data 
obtained 
from 
our 
cohort 
of 
children 
with 
snoring 
(mild 
SDB), 
compared 
with 
longitudinal 
data 
from 
nonsnoring 
control 
subjects. 
We 
predicted 
that 
the 
postoperative 
amelioration 
of 
SDB 
would 
lead 
to 
normalization 
of 
MCAV, 
with 
improvements 
in 
cognition 
and 
behavior.

a 
subgroup 
of 
children 
whose 
baseline 
measures 
were 
described 
in 
detail 
in 
an 
earlier 
report.13 
A 
total 
of 
21 
children 
with 
SDB 
(3–7 
years 
of 
age) 
and 
17 
age-similar 
control 
subjects 
underwent 
baseline 
(preoperative) 
assessment; 
19 
and 
14 
children, 
respectively, 
returned 
a 
mean 
of 
12 
months 
(SD: 
1.9 
months) 
later 
for 
follow-up 
assessment 
(this 
assessment 
is 
termed 
“postoperative,” 
although 
control 
children 
did 
not 
undergo 
surgery). 
Two 
postoperative 
children 
and 
1 
control 
subject 
declined 
the 
invitation 
for 
follow-up 
assess


ment, 
and 
2 
families 
could 
not 
be 
contacted. 
In 
total, 
86% 
of 
the 
original 
sample 
returned 
for 
follow-up 
assessment. 
The 
demographic 
characteristics 
of 
the 
follow-up 
cohort 
are 
presented 
in 
Table 
1. 


All 
19 
children 
with 
SDB 
were 
recruited 
from 
adenotonsillectomy 
waiting 
lists 
in 
the 
mixed 
urban-rural 
districts 
of 
Southampton 
and 
Portsmouth, 
England. 
Selection 
was 
based 
on 
a 
positive 
history 
of 
snoring 
with 
a 
clinical 
indication 
for 
adenotonsillectomy. 
Of 
the 
19 
children 
reported 
here, 
the 
primary 
indication 
for 
surgery 
was 
SDB 
for 
7, 
recurrent 
tonsillitis 
for 
6, 
and 
both 
clinical 
indications 
for 
the 
remaining 
6. 
Although 
the 
original 
intention 
had 
been 
to 
identify 
a 
range 
of 
severity 
of 
obstructed 
breathing, 
the 
majority 
of 
cases 
fell 
within 
the 
mild 
range. 
The 
presence 
of 
snoring 
was 
confirmed 
for 
all 
case 
subjects 
by 
parental 
report 
with 
the 
Pediatric 
Sleep 
Questionnaire 
(PSQ), 
a 
validated 
screening 
tool 
for 
SDB.16 
Children 
with 
craniofacial 
abnormalities, 
neuromuscular 
disorders, 
moderate 
or 
severe 
learning 
disabilities, 
chronic 
respiratory/cardiac 
conditions, 
or 
allergic 
rhinitis 
were 
excluded. 
Overnight 
attended 
polysomnography 
was 
conducted 
preoperatively 
for 
clinical 
case 
subjects 
in 
a 
purpose-built 
sleep 
laboratory 
by 
using 
computerized 
systems 
(Embla 
system 
with 
Somnologica

software; 
Medcare 
Flaga, 
Reykjavik, 
Iceland), 
according 
to 
American 
Thoracic 
Society 
standards.17 
A 
standard 
montage 
was 
recorded, 
including 
electroencephalography 
(C3/A2, 
O1/A2, 
C4/A1, 
and 
O2/A1), 
right

Sleep

was 
scored 
by 
using 
standard 
criteria.18 
Respiratory 
arousals 
were 
defined 
as 
changes 
in

frequency 
of 
1

Obstructive 
apnea 
was 
defined 
as 
the

or 
decrease 
of 
airflow 
by 
80%, 
compared 
with 
the 
preceding 
breath, 
for 
2 
breaths. 
Hypopnea 
was 
classified 
as 
described 
for 
apnea 
but 
the 
reduction 
in 
flow 
was 
50% 
to 
80%, 
compared 
with 
the 
previous 
breath, 
with 
associated 
desaturation 
or

Dartford, 
England). 
In 
total, 
16 
of 
19 
studies 
provided 
sufficient 
data 
for 
analysis. 


TCD 
Sonography 


TCD 
sonography 
was 
performed 
postoperatively 
by 
the 
same 
experienced 
operator 
(Dr 
Hogan) 
who 
supervised 
data 
acquisition 
in 
preoperative 
assessments, 
and 
who 
was 
blinded 
to 
data 
from 
the 
sleep 
studies. 
The 
same 
protocol 
as 
for 
the 
preoperative 
assessments 
was 
followed. 
In 
brief, 
averaged 
mean 
maximal 
MCAV 
values 
were 
obtained 
by 
using 
a 
Compumedics 
Doppler 
box 
(El 
Paso, 
TX) 
system. 
The 
middle 
cerebral 
artery 
was 
tracked 
from 
shallow 
depths 
to 
the 
middle 
cerebral 
artery/anterior 
cerebral 
artery 
bifurcation 
(53 
mm) 
at 
both 
the 
left 
and 
right 
temporal 
acoustic 
windows, 
and 
the 
highest 
value 
across 
both 
sides 
was 
recorded.20 
All 
TCD 
data 
were 
obtained 
between 
the 
hours 
of 
2 
and 
6 
PM, 
with 
the 
child 
relaxed 
in 
a 
semireclined 
position. 
Two 
children 
refused 
to 
undergo 
a 
TCD 
study 
at 
either 
time 
point. 
Two 
children 
refused 
to 
undergo 
a 
second 
study, 
in 
one 
case 
because 
the 
child 
could 
not 
tolerate 
the 
ultrasound 
gel 
and 
in 
the 
other 
because 
TCD 
sonography 
was 
interpreted 
by 
the 
child 
as 
a 
prelude 
to 
additional 
surgery. 
The 
parents 
of 
a 
third 
child 
did 
not 
have 
time 
to 
stay 
for 
the 
TCD 
study, 
which 
typically 
was 
performed 
after 
the 
neuropsychological 
assessment. 
Finally, 
preoperative 
TCD 
studies 
were 
not 
performed 
for 
2 
of 
the 
children 
because 
of 
technical 
problems, 
which 
resulted 
in 
a 
lack 
of 
longitudinal 
data 
in 
those 
cases. 
In 
total, 
longitudinal 
TCD 
data 
were 
obtained 
for 
12 
children 
who 
underwent 
adenotonsillectomy 
and 
14 
control 
subjects. 


Neuropsychological 
Assessments 
and 
Parent-Reported 
Behavior 


All 
children 
underwent 
preoperative 
neuropsychological 
assessment, 
including 
administration 
of 
an 
age-appropriate 
IQ 
test 
(Wechsler 
PreSchool 
and 
Primary 
Scale 
of 
Intelligence-III 
[WPPSI-III]) 
and 
selected 
subtests 
from 


the 
Neuropsychological 
Test 
Battery 
(visual 
attention 
and 
design 
copy); 
parents 
completed 
the 
Behavior 
Rating 
Inventory 
of 
Executive 
Function 
(BRIEF). 
In 
postoperative 
assessments, 
only 
tests 
that 
yielded 
significant 
preoperative 
group 
differences 
were 
readministered, 
namely, 
the 
coding 
and 
symbol 
search 
subtests 
of 
the 
WPPSI-III, 
which 
together 
yield 
a 
processing 
speed 
index 
(mean: 
100; 
SD: 
15); 
the 
visual 
attention 
subtest 
of 
the 
Neuropsychological 
Test 
Battery 
(mean: 
10; 
range: 
1–19; 
SD: 
3); 
and 
the 
parent-completed 
BRIEF 
questionnaire 
(global 
executive 
composite 
T 
scores 
are 
reported; 
clinically 
significant 
scores 
are 
65). 
The 
processing 
speed 
tests 
(coding 
and 
symbol 
search 
subtests 
of 
the 
WPPSIIII) 
were 
administered 
only 
to 
children 
4 
years 
of 
age, 
in 
line 
with 
the 
WPPSI-III 
protocol. 


Statistical 
Analyses 


Statistical 
analyses 
were 
conducted 
by 
using 
SPSS 
for 
Windows 
14.0 
(SPSS, 
Chicago, 
IL). 
Data 
were 
first 
explored 
by 
using 
the 
Shapiro-Wilk 
test 
of 
normality, 
which 
is 
appropriate 
for 
small 
samples. 
The 
results 
of 
nonparametric 
tests 
are 
reported 
when 
data 
were 
not 
normally 
distributed. 
Mixed-design 
analysis 
of 
variance 
models 
with 
repeated 
measures 
were 
used 
to 
determine 
whether 
children 
with 
mild 
SDB 
showed 
significant 
changes 
in 
MCAV, 
processing 
speed, 
visual 
attention, 
and 
executive 
function 
behavior. 
In 
each 
model, 
there 
was 
1 
within-subjects 
factor 
(eg, 
preoperative 
and 
postoperative 
MCAV 
values) 
and 
1 
between-subjects 
factor 
(control 
subjects 
versus 
children 
with 
SDB). 
Trends 
approaching 
significance 
(P 
. 
.09) 
are 
reported. 


RESULTS 


Demographic 
Features 


BMI 
z 
scores 
and 
gender 
were 
not 
significantly 
different 
between 
case 
subjects 
and 
control 
subjects 
at 
baseline. 
All 
children 
were 
white 
European, 
except 
for 
a 
single 
child 
with 
SDB 
whose 
ethnicity 
was 
Asian 
(Indian 
subcontinent). 
Ages 
were 
equivalent 
across 
groups 
at 
each 
assessment 
(Table 
1). 
There 
was 
a 
small 
but 
statistically 
significant 
difference 
between 
groups 
in 
the 
interval 
between 
preoperative 
and 
postoperative 
assessments 
(mean 
difference: 
2.3 
months; 
SE: 
0.56 
months). 
This 
was 
attributable 
to 
difficulties 
involved 
in 
scheduling 
control 
children 
for 
follow-up 
assessments 
during 
their 
school 
vacation. 


Indices 
of 
SDB 
(SDB 
Group) 


Parental 
reports 
of 
reductions 
in 
snoring 
after 
tonsillectomy 
were 
supported 
by 
a 
significantly 
lower 
median 
score 
on 
the 
PSQ 
postoperatively, 
compared 
with 
pre-
operatively 
(Table 
2). 
The 
majority 
of 
children 
(15 
of 
19 
children) 
obtained 
significant 
case 
scores 
before 
surgery, 
whereas 
this 
proportion 
was 
decreased 
after 
surgery 
(5 
of 
16 
children; 
McNemar, 
n 
. 
16; 
P 
. 
.008); 
2 
preoperation 
and 
1 
postoperation 
ratings 
were 
missing. 


Polysomnographic 
variables 
obtained 
preoperatively 
indicated 
that 
children 
had 
mild 
SDB 
(AHI:

As 
revealed 
in

MCAV 
decreased 
significantly 
in 
the 
SDB 
group 
(n 
. 
12) 
between 
the 
2 
assessment 
times, 
whereas 
there 
was 
an 
increase 
in

This 
resulted 
in 
a 
significant

between 
assessment

and 
group 
(F1,24

P

Importantly, 
this 
value 
remained 
significant 
when 
the

and 
there 
was 
no

In

(t22.1

Cognition 
and 
Behavior 


For 
both 
processing 
speed 
index 
and 
visual 
attention, 
the 
SDB 
group 
obtained 
higher 
postoperative 
scores, 
compared 
with 
preoperative 
scores, 
whereas 
control 
children 
showed 
a 
slight 
decrease 
over 
time 
(Table 
3). 
There 
was 
a 
trend 
for 
a 
significant 
interaction 
between 
assessment 
time 
and 
group 
for 
processing 
speed 
(F1,22 
. 
3.79; 
P 
. 
.064). 
A 
significant 
interaction 
between 
assessment 
time 
and 
group 
was 
found 
for 
visual 
attention 
(F1,30 
. 
4.45; 
P 
.043), 
but 
this 
value 
was 
attenuated 
with 
the 
inclusion 
of 
test-retest 
time 
interval 
as 
a 
covariate 
(P 
.110). 
The 
difference 
in 
the 
mean 
time 
interval 
between 
the 
control 
and 
SDB 
groups 
was 
small, 
2 
months; 
however, 
this 
visual 
attention 
analysis 
of 
variance 
result 
should 
be 
interpreted 
cautiously. 


Posthoc 
testing 
was 
conducted, 
and 
a 
significant 
preoperative 
group 
difference 
for 
processing 
speed 
index 
(t22 
. 
2.5; 
P 
. 
.017) 
was 
absent 
postoperatively 
(P 
. 
.624). 
Similarly, 
a 
trend 
for 
a 
significant 
preoperative 
group 
difference 
for 
visual 
attention 
scores 
(t30 
1.85; 
P 
.073) 
was 
reduced 
postoperatively 
(P 
. 
.362). 
Taken 
together, 
these 
results 
suggest 
that, 
compared 
with 
baseline 
data, 
the 
postoperative 
performance 
of 
children 
with 
SDB 
was 
more 
consistent 
with 
that 
of 
control 
subjects.

DISCUSSION 


We

provided 
novel 
evidence 
that

SDB 
was 
associated 
with 
cerebral 
hemodynamic 
changes 
in 
otherwise-
healthy 
young 
children.13 
The 
present 
study 
extended 
this 
finding 
to 
demonstrate 
that 
improvement 
in 
SDB 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
was 
associated 
with 
normalization 
of 
cerebral 
hemodynamic 
features, 
as 
well 
as 
small 
improvements 
in 
processing 
speed 
and 
visual 
attention. 
Furthermore, 
the 
extent 
of 
change 
in 
MCAV 
was 
significantly 
correlated 
with 
postoperative 
improvement 
in 
overnight 
mean 
SpO2. 


In 
a 
cross-sectional 
study, 
MCAV 
was 
higher 
in 
older, 
normally 
developing 
children,20 
that 
is, 
12 
cm/seconds 
higher 
in 
a 
group 
of 
children 
between 
6 
and 
9.9 
years 
of 
age, 
compared 
with 
a 
group 
of 
children 
between 
1 
and 


2.9 
years 
of 
age, 
with 
the 
greatest 
increases 
occurring 
before 
the 
age 
of 
6 
years. 
During 
childhood, 
the 
highest 
MCAV 
is 
likely 
to 
be 
present 
between 
6 
and 
8 
years 
of 
age.21 
Consistent 
with 
this 
normative 
evidence, 
over 
the 
course 
of 
follow-up 
monitoring 
we 
observed 
a 
mean 
increase 
of 
13 
cm/seconds 
in 
our 
healthy 
control 
subjects, 
all 
of 
whom 
were 
7 
years 
of 
age. 
In 
contrast, 
children 
with 
SDB 
showed 
a 
postoperative 
decrease 
in 
MCAV. 
Importantly, 
however, 
this 
placed 
them 
within 
the 
range 
for 
age-similar, 
healthy, 
control 
subjects. 
It 
is 
possible 
that 
MCAV 
was 
initially 
increased 
in 
response 
to 
intermittent 
nocturnal 
hypoxia 
associated 
with 
upper-airway 
obstruction 
in 
sleep 
or 
to 
associated 
sympathetic 
activation, 
anemia, 
or 
hypercapnia.12 
Reduction 
of 
MCAV 
with 
amelioration 
of 
upper-airway 
obstruction 
suggests 
the 
validity 
of 
this 
hypothesis 
but 
does 
not 
confirm 
the 
underlying 
mechanism. 
We 
found 
in 
a 
subgroup 
of 
children 
that 
the 
extent 
of 
decrease 
in 
MCAV 
was 
significantly 
associated 
with 
increases 
in 
mean 
overnight 
SpO2. 
If 
this 
finding 
is 
confirmed, 
then 
this 
may 
suggest 
that 
increased 
MCAV 
reflects 
a 
cascade 
of 
adaptive 
physiologic 
changes 
promoting 
an 
increase 
in 
cerebral 
blood 
flow 
and 
offering 
the 
immature 
brain 
some 
protection 
from 
the 
potentially 
damaging 
effects 
of 
SDB, 
including 
intermittent 
or 
sustained 
hypoxia. 


Upper-airway 
obstruction 
in 
sleep 
in 
adults 
is 
associated 
with 
characteristic 
cardiovascular 
and 
cerebrovascular 
responses. 
Typically, 
an 
episode 
of 
apnea 
induces 
increases 
in 
cerebral 
blood 
flow 
and 
mean 
arterial 
pressure, 
followed 
by 
abrupt 
decreases 
at 
the 
termination 
of 
apnea 
to 
levels 
below 
baseline 
values.22 
The 
initial 
increase 
in 
cerebral 
blood 
flow 
is 
driven 
by 
a 
combination 
of 
chemoreceptor 
responses 
to 
increasing 
PCO2 
and 
increasing 
blood 
pressure. 
The 
latter 
is 
stimulated 
by 
sympathetic 
activation, 
which 
is 
itself 
a 
consequence 
of 
hypoxia.23,24 
The 
abrupt 
significant 
decrease 
in 
cerebral 
blood 
flow 
at 
apnea 
termination, 
with 
the 
potential 
for 
cerebral 
hypoperfusion, 
has 
been 
postulated 
to 
be 
a 
consequence 
of 
brain 
arousal, 
because 
it 
does 
not 
parallel 
the 
slower 
decrease 
in 
PCO2.25 
To 
our 
knowledge, 
there 
are 
no 
published 
studies 
of 
MCAV 
during 
apnea 
episodes 
in 
children, 
but 
it 
is 
possible 
that 
similar 
responses 
may 
occur. 


In 
adults, 
there 
is 
evidence 
for 
an 
association 
between 
SDB, 
oxyhemoglobin 
desaturation, 
and 
carotid 
artery 
intima-media 
thickness 
diagnosed 
noninvasively 
by 
using 
ultrasonography.26 
The 
mechanism 
probably 
involves 
endothelial 
dysfunction 
in 
relation 
to 
hypoxia 
and 
inflammation27 
and 
reduction 
of 
circulating 
levels 
of 
the 
very 
potent 
vasodilator 
nitric 
oxide.28 
Intracranial 
MCAV 
is 
slightly 
but 
not 
significantly 
lower 
in 
adults 
with 
SDB 
than 
control 
subjects,25 
perhaps 
reflecting 
slightly 
lower 
cerebral 
blood 
flow 
distal 
to 
carotid 
artery 
narrowing. 
The 
pediatric 
data 
presented 
here 
for 
a 
neurologically 
normal 
population 
with 
SDB 
showed 
MCAV 
to 
be 
higher 
than 
that 
in 
control 
subjects 
(secondary 
to 
either 
hyperperfusion 
or 
narrowing 
of 
the 
intracranial 
vessels) 
and 
to 
decrease 
with 
amelioration 
of 
SDB.

terestingly, 
the 
majority 
of 
children 
with 
stroke 
have 
middle 
cerebral 
rather 
than 
carotid 
vessel 
disease,29 
which 
suggests 
differences 
in 
the 
vessels 
that 
are 
vulnerable 
to 
environmental 
influences, 
such 
as 
hypoxia 
and 
infection. 
The 
control 
mechanisms 
responsible 
for 
cerebral 
vascular 
regulation 
operate 
in 
an 
age-dependent 
way; 
for 
example, 
nitric 
oxide 
contributes 
increasingly 
to 
the 
regulation 
of 
cerebral 
hemodynamics 
as 
a 
function 
of 
age, 
and 
there 
might 
be 
variations 
in 
vascular 
distribution.
30 
The 
role 
of 
the 
sympathetic 
nervous 
system 
has 
been 
studied 
to 
only 
a 
limited 
extent 
in 
children. 
Data 
confirmed 
that 
children 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
had 
elevated 
sympathetic 
nervous 
system 
tone 
during 
the 
day.8 
Similar 
findings 
for 
adults 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea31 
were 
postulated 
to 
be 
a 
consequence 
of 
the 
physiologic 
stress 
of 
exposure 
to 
repetitive 
hypoxic 
apnea.
32 
Furthermore, 
studies 
in 
adults 
demonstrated 
increased 
cerebral 
blood 
flow 
velocity 
in 
response 
to 
sympathetic 
nervous 
system 
stimulation.33,34 
Similar 
studies 
in 
children 
would 
be 
instructive. 


There 
is 
evidence 
for 
diurnal 
variation 
in 
cerebrovascular 
responses 
to 
hypercapnia 
in 
adults 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea35,36 
and 
for 
rapid 
reversal 
of 
the 
diminished 
daytime 
vasodilator 
reserve 
with 
continuous 
positive 
airway 
pressure 
therapy.37 
Similar 
reversible, 
attenuated, 
cerebral 
blood 
flow 
responses 
to 
isocapnic 
hypoxia 
have 
been 
reported. 
The 
vasodilatory 
response 
to 
hypoxia 
does 
not 
show 
diurnal 
variation35 
but 
also 
improves 
with 
continuous 
positive 
airway 
pressure 
therapy.38 
Of 
particular 
interest, 
the 
degree 
of 
cerebral 
blood 
flow 
velocity 
change 
for 
treated 
patients 
was 
associated 
with 
the 
severity 
of 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea, 
as 
indicated 
by 
the 
AHI.38 
We 
conducted 
a 
similar 
analysis 
of 
our 
data, 
correlating 
preoperative 
AHI 
scores 
with 
the 
extent 
of 
MCAV 
changes 
postoperatively 
and 
we 
also 
found 
greater 
MCAV 
reductions 
for 
those 
with 
higher 
initial 
AHI 
values, 
although 
this 
fell 
short 
of 
statistical 
significance. 


CONCLUSIONS 


These 
data 
are 
consistent 
with 
the 
hypothesis 
that 
an 
increase 
in 
steady-state 
MCAV 
during 
the 
day 
may 
be 
related 
to 
nocturnal 
intermittent 
hypoxia. 
What 
is 
striking 
about 
these 
data 
is 
the 
extent 
of 
differences 
between 
the 
MCAV 
findings, 
given 
the 
relatively 
mild 
hypoxia 
and 
SDB 
observed 
in 
the 
case 
subjects. 
It 
will 
be 
important 
to 
explore 
this 
relationship 
in 
children 
with 
more-
severe 
SDB 
and 
to 
address 
the 
limitations 
of 
the 
methods 
in 
our 
preliminary 
study. 
In 
particular, 
future 
studies 
should 
use 
objective 
screening 
tools 
to 
exclude 
SDB 
assertively 
in 
the 
control 
group, 
because 
even 
the 
best 
screening 
questionnaires 
can 
yield 
false-negative 
results; 
for 
example, 
the 
PSQ 
is 
reported 
to 
have 
a 
sensitivity 
of 


0.81 
to 
0.85 
in 
detecting 
SDB, 
compared 
with 
polysomnographic 
diagnosis.16 
Selection 
of 
appropriate 
control 
subjects 
also 
might 
consider 
the 
natural 
progression 
of 
measured 
variables 
over 
a 
similar 
time 
period 
in 
non– 
surgically 
treated 
children 
with 
adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy. 
This 
might 
shed 
light 
on 
the 
unique 
contribution 
of 
the 
surgical 
procedure 
and 
amelioration 
of 
SDB 
to 
the 
measured 
outcomes. 
Larger 
subject 
numbers 
in 
future 
studies 
would 
facilitate 
the 
study 
of 
gender-specific 
changes 
in 
MCAV. 
This 
is 
relevant 
because 
previous 
studies 
demonstrated 
higher 
MCAV 
in 
healthy 
prepubertal 
girls, 
compared 
with 
boys.39 
Hypercapnia 
and 
anemia 
also 
might 
affect 
MCAV. 
Although 
acute 
increases 
in 
PCO2 
are 
associated 
with 
relatively 
large 
rapid 
changes 
in 
MCAV,25 
the 
cerebral 
circulation 
tends 
to 
adapt, 
and 
baseline 
end-tidal 
PCO2 
accounted 
for 
only 
5% 
of 
the 
variation 
in 
baseline 
MCAV 
in 
our 
previous 
study 
(C.M.H., 
A.M.H., 
D.H., 
and 
F.J.K., 
unpublished 
data, 
2006). 
In 
the 
current 
study, 
for 
the 
4 
children 
for 
whom 
hemoglobin 
levels 
were 
measured 
intraoperatively, 
we 
found 
little 
evidence 
that 
this 
parameter 
accounted 
for 
the 
increase 
in 
MCAV.13 
It 
would 
be 
difficult 
to 
justify 
postoperative 
measurements 
of 
hemoglobin 
levels 
in 
otherwise-healthy 
children, 
but 
studies 
of 
children 
with 
SDB 
and 
chronic 
anemia 
might 
be 
instructive. 


It 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
infer 
a 
direct 
causative 
relationship 
between 
SDB 
and 
cerebral 
hemodynamic 
adaptation 
in 
children; 
rather, 
subtle 
physiologic 
changes 
are 
likely 
to 
result 
from 
intermittent 
nocturnal 
hypoxia 
and 
apnea. 
Evidence 
of 
persisting 
behavioral 
abnormalities 
on 
the 
BRIEF 
suggests 
that 
such 
adaptation 
may 
be 
imperfect. 
Our 
data 
are 
preliminary; 
however, 
the 
reversibility 
of 
the 
increased 
MCAV 
in 
children 
with 
mild 
SDB 
is 
an 
intriguing 
finding. 
Although 
these 
changes 
may 
initially 
protect 
the 
immature 
brain, 
altered 
autonomic 
tone 
or 
endothelial 
function, 
if 
uncorrected, 
may 
risk 
longer-
term 
cardiovascular 
sequelae. 
Studies 
showing 
improvement 
in 
cognitive 
function 
with 
amelioration 
of 
SDB 
suggest 
some 
support 
for 
the 
“adaptive-response” 
interpretation 
of 
our 
results.40,41 
Parents 
in 
our 
study 
reported 
improvement 
in 
executive 
function, 
although 
this 
was 
not 
statistically 
significant. 
Because 
the 
mean 
T 
score 
obtained 
from 
children 
with 
SDB 
was 
within 
the 
reference 
range 
at 
both 
assessments, 
a 
longer 
duration 
of 
follow-up 
monitoring 
or 
a 
larger 
sample 
size 
may 
be 
required 
to 
demonstrate 
significant 
improvement 
in 
such 
behavior. 
However, 
a 
longitudinal 
study 
indicated 
that 
significant 
improvement 
in 
parent-rated 
behavior 
is 
most 
likely 
to 
occur 
within 
the 
first 
6 
months 
after 
surgery.42 


Although 
additional 
work 
on 
the 
mechanism 
is 
required, 
it 
is 
of 
interest 
that 
a 
postoperative 
decrease 
in 
MCAV 
paralleled 
an 
improvement 
in 
nocturnal 
oxyhemoglobin 
saturation. 
This 
finding 
may 
provide 
the 
impetus 
for 
further 
investigation 
of 
the 
mechanisms 
underpinning 
cognitive 
and 
behavioral 
deficits 
in 
children 
who 
snore.

Description 
This 
is 
a 
comprehensive 
review 
of 
cancer 
in 
adolescents 
between 
the 
ages 
of 
15 
and 
20. 
As 
in 
many 
other 
areas 
of 
pediatrics, 
this 
group 
has 
specific 
and 
serious 
issues 
unique 
to 
their 
age 
which 
have 
received 
little 
attention 
during 
the 
past 
half 
century. 
For 
this 
reason 
this 
book 
is 
extremely 
important 
as 
the 
definitive 
text 
on 
patients 
in 
this 
age 
group 
with 
cancer. 
Purpose 
This 
outstanding 
book 
describes 
principles 
of 
practice 
for 
every 
physician 
in 
pediatrics. 
Desperately 
needed, 
this 
book 
certainly 
meets 
the 
authors’ 
objectives 
of 
providing 
a 
comprehensive 
review 
of 
all 
cancers 
in 
adolescents 
and 
young 
adults. 
Audience 
It 
is 
written 
for 
students, 
residents, 
or 
practitioners, 
whether 
they 
are 
general 
pediatricians, 
nurses, 
pediatric 
oncologists, 
or 
other 
pediatric 
subspecialists 
who 
are 
involved 
in 
the 
care 
of 
adolescent 
or 
young 
adult 
patients 
with 
cancer. 
Features 
The 
outstanding 
first 
chapter 
looks 
at 
incidence, 
diagnosis, 
risk 
factors, 
and 
issues 
related 
to 
adolescents 
and 
includes 
an 
interesting 
discussion 
of 
how 
dramatically 
the 
types 
of 
cancer 
change 
as 
a 
function 
of 
age. 
Between 
the 
ages 
of 
15 
and 
19 
melanoma 
goes 
from 
the 
ninth 
most 
frequently 
diagnosed 
cancer 
to 
the 
most 
frequent. 
During 
this 
same 
age 
range, 
leukemia 
moves 
from 
the 
second 
most 
frequently 
diagnosed 
cancer 
to 
the 
eleventh. 
Female 
genital 
tract 
malignancy 
moves 
from 
tenth 
to 
second 
and 
testicular 
carcinoma 
from 
eighth 
to 
third 
with 
bone 
sarcomas 
moving 
from 
the 
fifth 
to 
twelfth. 
In 
all 
the 
age 
groups 
currently 
being 
treated 
for 
cancer, 
the 
results 
in 
terms 
of 
improved 
survival 
are 
worse 
in 
the 
15-20 
year 
old 
age 
group 
than 
in 
any 
other 
group. 
The 
editors 
discuss 
the 
issues 
of 
transition 
from 
pediatric 
to 
adult 
care, 
with 
most 
adolescent 
cancer 
patients 
moving 
at 
the 
age 
of 
15 
instead 
of 
18 
or 
21. 
The 
book 
is 
then 
divided 
into 
excellent 
chapters 
on 
specific 
cancers. 
It 
concludes 
with 
chapters 
on 
psychological 
support, 
economic 
considerations, 
access 
to 
care, 
ethical 
issues, 
and 
long 
term 
survivorship, 
specifically 
dealing 
with 
the 
affects 
of 
late 
treatment. 
Assessment 
This 
outstanding 
book 
should 
be 
a 
part 
of 
every 
pediatric 
library. 
It 
is 
an 
important 
and 
beautifully 
written 
and 
illustrated 
book 
and 
is 
the 
only 
one 
I 
am 
aware 
of 
that 
addresses 
the 
issue 
of 
cancer 
in 
adolescents 
and 
young 
adults. 
It 
is 
a 
must 
read 
for 
pediatric 
specialists.

page e868, under the Discussion section, on line 56, the authors wrote “In 
contrast, late preterm gestation, low birth weight, male gender, and Asian 
ethnicity increased the risk of readmission, with late preterm infants having 

3 times the risk.” This should have read “with infants of 35-36 weeks 
gestation having 3 times the risk.”
