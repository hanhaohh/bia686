respiratory events during sleep in children.15,16 In 
contrast, children younger than 3 years of age being 
evaluated for snoring had higher obstructive apnea 
hypopnea index (AHI) in the supine position.17 Furthermore, 
when Cuhadaroglu et al.18 evaluated the effect of 
body position on the frequency of obstructive respiratory 
events among 55 children with ages ranging between 3 and 
9 years, their findings suggested that the supine position 
was associated with improved AHI compared to the side 
position in children with adenoid hypertrophy, but without 
tonsillar hypertrophy. In contrast, children with adenotonsillar 
hypertrophy breathed worse when they slept in 
the supine position, thereby suggesting that body position 
and anatomical factors such as tonsillar size may interact 
and affect overall disease severity.18 Nevertheless, the 
overall conflicting findings reported heretofore in snoring 
children, and the discrepancies between the findings 
emanating from studies in children and those of adult 
populations suggested that the relatively small number of 
patients thus far assessed and potential preferential 
selection of body positions during sleep that reduce the 
risk for upper airway obstruction and that could skew 
polysomnographic findings, could have contributed to the 
a priori disparate findings. Therefore, we conducted 
the present study to test several related hypotheses, 
namely (i) that children with OSA may preferentially 
adopt the supine position compared to non-snoring 
children if indeed such position is associated with a 
reduced risk for upper airway obstruction as suggested by 
some of the previous studies; (ii) that children with OSA, 
the supine position will not affect the overall obstructive 
respiratory disturbance except if obesity is concurrently 
present; (iii) that the size of tonsils and the sleep position 
do not interact to modify the severity of OSA in children. 
To examine these issues, we conducted a retrospective 
examination of polysomnographic findings in a large 
cohort of children with OSA who were diagnosed in our 
pediatric sleep center and also included an age-and gender 
matched population of healthy children recruited from the 
community. 

SUBJECTS AND METHODS 

The study was approved by the institutional review 
board and the committee for the protection of Human 
Subjects at the University of Louisville and at Kosair 
Children’s Hospital. The study population included 
all children between 1 and 18 years of age, evaluated 
with an overnight polysomnographic evaluation (PSG) 
from October 2001 till September 2005 for suspected 
sleep-disordered-breathing (SDB) whose overnight polysomnographic 
studies revealed a diagnosis of OSAS. The 
clinical characteristics of these 430 OSAS patients were 
documented from their clinic charts. Data extracted from 
the sleep studies and clinical charts included age, gender,

height, weight, ethnicity, and estimates of tonsillar size. 
Mean tonsillar size was assessed by visual inspection and 
scored on a scale of 0 (no enlargement) to 4 (kissing 
tonsils).19 Of note, children were excluded if they had any 
known chronic medical conditions, or suffered from any 
genetic or craniofacial syndromes. 

The diagnostic criteria for OSAS used in our study 
included an apnea index (AI) greater than 2/hr TST, and/or 
an obstructive apnea-hypopnea index greater than 5/hr 
TSTwith a nadir oxygen saturationvalue of at least <92%. 
Central and mixed apnea were not included in the 
repiratory disturbance indices and were not further 
analyzed due to their overall small contribution to the 
respiratory disturbance index. However, central AI was 

0.77 . 
0.07/hr TST, and mixed AI was 0.27 . 
0.03/hr 
TST. 
As control subjects, we included 185 non-snoring 
children participating in a large community-based study in 
Louisville, KY. This community-based cohort was agegender-
ethnically matched with the patient cohort, and 
their overnight PSG were within normal limits.20 

Polysomnographic Evaluation 

All subjects reported to the Sleep Laboratory around 

7:30 pm, and the sleep studies began around 9:00– 
9:30 pm. The following parameters were measured: chest 
and abdominal wall movement by respiratory impedance 
or inductance plethysmography, heart rate by ECG; air 
flow with a sidestream end-tidal capnograph (PETCO2; 
BCI SC-300, Menomonee Falls, WI) which also provided 
breath-by-breath assessment of end-tidal carbon dioxide 
levels, nasal pressure, and an oral-nasal airflow thermistor. 
Arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) was assessed by 
pulse oximetry (Nellcor N 100; Nellcor, Inc., Hayward, 
CA), with simultaneously recorded pulse waveform. 
Bilateral electro-oculogram (EOG), eight channels of 
electroencephalogram (EEG), chin and anterior tibial 
electromyograms (EMG), and analog output from a 
body position sensor (Braebon Medical Corporation, 
Ogsdenburg, NY) were also monitored. All measures 
were digitized using a commercially available computerized 
PSG system (MedCare Diagnostics, Buffalo, NY). 
Tracheal sound was monitored with a microphone sensor 
(Sleepmate, Midlothian, VA) and digital time-synchronized 
video images were collected. The sleep technician 
followed patient behavior and confirmed sleep position by 
the infra-red camera inside the room. All the studies were 
initially scored by a certified technician and were then 
reviewed by physicians experienced in pediatric polysomnography. 
The scorer had no prior knowledge of the 
physical examination findings in the upper airways of the 
children. Sleep architecture was assessed by standard 
techniques.21 The proportion of time spent in each sleep 
stage was expressed as percentage of total sleep time

Sleep Position in OSAS Children: Effect of Obesity 

Among the 430 children with OSAS, 204 (47.4%) 
fulfilled the relative BMI > 
95% criteria of obesity. When 
sleeping position frequencies were compared between 
obese and non-obese OSAS patients, obese children with 
OSAS were more likely to adopt the prone position 

(20.4 . 
2.0%TST) during sleep when compared to non-
obese children with OSAS (10.9 . 
2.5%TST; P 
< 
0.005). 
The increased proportion of sleep time spent in prone 
position in obese children occurred in conjunction with 
a reciprocal decrease in the side position sleep 
(37.0 . 
2.4%TST vs. 46.5 . 
2.8%TST; P 
< 
0.01). There 
were no significant differences in the overall %TST spent 
in supine position (42.0 . 
2.0%TST and 43.1 . 
2.6%TST 
for obese and non-obese respectively). 
Effect of Body Position on Respiratory 
Disturbance in Obese and Non-Obese 
OSAS Children 

Two hundred and four obese children with OSAS and 
203 non-obese children with OSAS whose mean AHI and 
AI were matched were identified to examine the effect of 
obesity on position-dependent effect on respiratory 

disturbances. The overall mean AHI and AI according to 
body position during sleep in obese and non-obese 
children is shown in Figure 1. Obese children displayed 
increased AHI and AI in the supine position compared to 
non-obese children (P 
< 
0.001). Conversely, non-obese 
OSAS patients showed increased AHI in both the side and 
prone positions when compared to the AHI in the supine 
position (P 
< 
0.01). There were no differences in AI 
among all three body positions during sleep among non-
obese OSAS children. Stated differently, obese children 
had near doubling of their AI and AHI from prone to 
supine positions and such effect was absent in non-obese 
children. Furthermore, using a general linear model 
analysis, we found no evidence to support an effect of 
age on the sleep position related effects on AHI among 
obese children. Indeed, the effect of body position on 
sleep-related respiratory disturbances remained 
unchanged across the age spectrum. 

Effect of Tonsillar Size on Respiratory 
Disturbance in Relation to Sleeping Position 

Categorical assignment of the OSAS cohort into five 
groups based on tonsillar size failed to reveal any 
significant differences in either AHI or AI as a function 
of body position during sleep. For example, among 
children with size four tonsils, AHI was similar in all 
three positions; similarly, children with size two tonsils, 
no differences emerged in the supine, prone, or side 
positions. Of note, in children with size 0 tonsils, the 
supine position was associated with higher AHI and AI 
compared to either side or prone. However, this effect 
disappeared when adjusted for BMI, because this latter 
group included a large majority of obese children (86%). 

DISCUSSION 

In this study, we initially examined the distribution 
of body position during sleep in children with OSAS and 
age-, gender-and ethnically-matched controls. Our findings 
indicate that children with OSAS spend increasing

and 203 non-obese (open columns) children with OSAS.

proportions of their sleep in the supine position and less 
time in the side position compared to healthy children. 
However, the presence of obesity markedly modifies the 
overall distribution of body position through the night, 
with obese children with OSAS spending increasing 
proportions of their sleep in the prone position compared 
to non-obese children. These latter findings suggest that 
the prone position may promote upper airway patency in 
the presence of obesity. 

Before we address the significance of our findings, some 
methodological issues require comment. The retrospective 
nature of this study precludes the application of very 
stringent methodologies for measurements of tonsillar 
size and other observer dependent measures such as 
scoring of polysomnographic respiratory disturbances 
(considering that multiple scorers performed such tasks). 
We should mention however, that in regards to the latter 
potential limitation, the interscorer variability in the sleep 
laboratory is monitored periodically and amounts to less 
than 5%, such that interscorer variability contribution was 
minimal at most. We could not accurately determine the 
extent of adenoidal growth and relied on radiological 
reports whenever available. Because of the relatively 
inaccurate nature of such assessments, we opted not to 
include them in our analyses. Furthermore, we were not 
able to incorporate measures of nasal flow limitation and/ 
or ascertain the presence of concomitant rhinitis. 

The cumulative evidence thus far published on the 
distribution of body position during sleep in children and 
its effects on respiratory disturbance failed to incorporate 
a pre-emptive comparison of potentially different preferences 
of body position during sleep among children 
with OSAS and those adopted by healthy matched 
controls. Therefore, to the best of our knowledge this is 
the first study to show that children who suffer from OSAS 
are more likely to adopt the supine position during sleep 
when compared to normal children. These findings are in 
agreement with Pereira et al.17 and Cuhadaroglu et al.18 
who reported in much smaller cohorts of children with 
OSAS that the supine position is highly prevalent 
throughout the night. In contrast with such findings 
however, we identified a clear predilection for an 
increased proportion of total sleep duration to be spent 
in the prone position in obese children with OSAS, a 
finding that suggests that the supine or side positions may 
be operative as a risk factor for more severe respiratory 
disturbance when obesity and OSAS co-exist in children, 
and that such effect appears to be independent of age. This 
assumption was further confirmed upon examination of 
the severity of respiratory disturbance during sleep in 
relation to position in obese and non-obese children with 
OSAS. Thus, while the supine and side positions are 
adopted during the vast majority of sleep duration in 
OSAS and control children, modifications in the distribution 
of sleep positions from one night to another could 

clearly alter the magnitude of respiratory disturbance in 
OSAS children, and therefore either aggravate the severity 
(in case more percentage of sleep time occurred in the 
supine position) or reduce the severity of sleep-disordered 
breathing (if the prone position was adopted). This would 
be particularly the case for the obstructive apneic events, 
because our data support the notion that in otherwise 
normal children with OSAS, the supine position adversely 
affects the frequency of complete upper airway obstructions, 
but does not appear to modify the overall magnitude 
of the respiratory disturbance. Notwithstanding the 
relatively sizable, albeit clinically irrelevant inter-night 
variability observed in respiratory disturbance among 
pediatric patients with OSAS,3,4 our study would clearly 
justify giving consideration to the overall positional 
distribution through the night during clinical interpretation 
of polysomnographic studies in children. More 
specifically, if the prone or side positions were overrepresented 
in any particular study with borderline 
findings in respiratory disturbance, an increased index of 
suspicion to the potential presence of more severe OSAS 
than actually revealed by the sleep study should be 
applied. Another consideration that may need to be 
incorporated in future studies is whether body position 
distribution during sleep differs between sleep recorded in 
the home versus sleep recorded in the sleep laboratory, 
because this may have implications for severity estimates 
of sleep disordered breathing based on our current 
findings. 

In a previous study, Goh et al.24 reported that the overall 
sleep architecture is preserved in children with OSAS. The 
current study partially challenges this concept considering 
the subtle alterations in sleep architecture that emerged in 
our cohort. Based on other work from our laboratory using 
smaller numbers of participants, we surmise that the small, 
albeit statistically significant, reflect small effects on sleep 
architecture that are identifiable only when large cohorts 
such as reported herein are studied25,26 

In a previous study, the severity of AHI was reduced in 
the supine position.16 Our findings clearly do not support 
such a contention because the AHI was not different in any 
given position. However, the AI was clearly worse in the 
supine position similar to previous findings in adults,10-14 
and this effect was also reported by a subsequent pediatric 
study.18 We believe that the partitioning of our cohort into 
obese and non-obese children may shed some light into the 
discrepant conclusions reached thus far by the various 
pediatric studies. Indeed, for non-obese and obese 
children with OSAS with similar AHI, the supine position 
was clearly worse for the obese children, although the 
OAHI was lower in the supine position for the non-obese 
children (Fig. 1). Thus, it is likely that the inconsistent 
findings across pediatric studies may simply represent the 
underlying disparities in the representation of children 
with or without obesity in the various studies. This 


contention is further supported by the rather strikingly 
similar conclusions recently reported in adults with 
OSAS.27 

In contradistinction with a previous study,19 we did not 
identify body position-tonsillar size relationships that 
modified respiratory disturbance in our cohort. Indeed, 
Cuhadaroglu et al. showed that when tonsils are 
hypertrophic, the severity of breathing patterns is 
worsened by the supine position.19 It is unclear whether 
their findings merely reflected the contribution of obesity, 
as shown by our analyses among those children with no 
evidence of tonsillar hypertrophy in whom the positional 
differences in AHI were primarily accounted by BMI 
rather than tonsillar size. Notwithstanding such considerations, 
it is clear that similar to adults, gravity is indeed a 
major contributor to upper airway patency, particularly 
when obesity is present. 

In summary, differences in the distribution of body 
position across the night emerge among children with 
OSAS compared to healthy children. Moreover, obese 
children with OSAS are more likely to adopt the prone 
position, suggesting that this position may promote upper 
airway patency in the presence of obesity. Although 
tonsillar size is not associated with positional differences 
in breathing disturbance, the presence or absence of 
obesity markedly modifies the frequency of upper airway 
obstructive events.
