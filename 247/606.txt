Abstract 

Objective: To establish whether there is a first night effect (FNE) in children and adolescents with suspected obstructive sleep apnoea 
undergoing polysomnography (PSG) and whether this affects sleep and breathing, furthermore, to determine the extent to which age may 
influence the sleep and cardiorespiratory parameters. 

Methods: One hundred and thirty-one children and adolescents (age classes—A: 2–6 years n ¼ 
37; B: 7–12 years n ¼ 
60; C: 13–17 
years n ¼ 
34) underwent PSG on 2 consecutive nights (I and II) under identical conditions for suspected sleep-related respiratory disorders. 
One hundred and five patients including 3 patients with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) treated by adenotonsillectomy and 18 
OSAS patients receiving nCPAP-therapy had no PSG-abnormalities (Group 1—A: n ¼ 
28; B: n ¼ 
53; C: n ¼ 
24). A further 26 patients 
(Group 2) had clinically and polysomnographically confirmed untreated OSAS (A: n ¼ 
9; B: n ¼ 
12; C: n ¼ 
5). 

Results: There were no statistically significant differences between children with no PSG-abnormalities (Group 1) and those with OSAS 
(Group 2) in terms of sleep parameters (arousal indices excluded), oxygen saturation (SaO2) and heart rate (HR), and these parameters have, 
therefore, been pooled for the entire group (n ¼ 
131) in the 3 age classes A, B and C. In the second and third age classes, sleep efficiency on 
the first night was reduced. In all age classes, there was significantly more wakefulness during the first night. In the second and third age 
ranges, the proportion of NREM 1 in the first night was significantly higher, with a correspondingly reduced proportion of NREM 4 in the 
third age group. In all age classes, REM sleep was significantly less during the first night, but REM latency was comparable on both nights. 
On the first night, the mean HR was higher. 

There were significant differences in apnoea/hypopnoea-index (AHI), electroencephalogram (EEG)-arousal-index (AI) and motoric 
arousal index (jerk index, JI) between Groups 1 and 2. In neither group, were there any significant differences in AHI, mean SaO2 or number 
of EEG-arousals between nights 1 and 2. Only in the age class A, in Group 2 (n ¼ 
9) was the number of motoric arousals significantly higher 
on the first night. 

Comparison of the age classes A, B, and C revealed that most polysomnographic parameters were age-dependent. Increasing age was 
found to correlate with a higher proportion of NREM 1, especially on the first night. Also, there was an age-dependent increase in NREM 2 on 
both nights, a decrease in NREM 3 on the first night, and a decrease in NREM 4 on both nights. In older children, we also found a lower 
proportion of REM sleep on the first night and a lower HR on both nights. In Group 1, we found a lowered AHI, AI and JI (for JI significant 
only on the first night) in older patients. No such age dependence of AHI, AI and JI was seen in OSAS patients (Group 2). 

Conclusions: In children and adolescents, there is an FNE comparable with that described in adults. In OSAS children and also in children 
with no PSG-abnormalities, there is night-to-night-variability in sleep parameters, but not in respiratory parameters. An adaptation night is, 
therefore, necessary when sleep architecture is to be studied, but not when only the nocturnal respiratory pattern is investigated. Sleep 
parameters, HR and arousal indices are all age-dependent.

and interpretation. Methodological differences among 
studies may result in different findings. Although the 
diagnostic evaluation of a sleep problem on the basis of a 
single-night polysomnography (PSG) is common (Acebo 
et al., 1996), doubt is often voiced that the first night is not 
representative when sleep organization and architecture 
need to be addressed. 

The first night effect (FNE) in adults, described by 
Agnew et al. (1966), is also observable in children in the 
form of diminished sleep quality, but few data on this effect 
in children have so far become available (Palm et al., 1989; 
American Thoracic Society, 1996; Emslie et al., 2001; Katz 
et al., 2002). 

In this study, we aimed to identify the parameters (sleep 
architecture, cardiac parameters, and respiratory parameters) 
that reflect sleep disturbances caused by the 
unfamiliar environment of a pediatric sleep laboratory in a 
first night polysomnographic study. The aim of the study 
was to show that sleep organization and architecture differ 
between the first and second nights. The question whether 
an adaptation night is necessary in polysomnographic 
studies in children and adolescents remains unanswered, 
and must also be seen in relation to changes in sleep 
behavior during development. 

Since data on the magnitude and nature of the FNE on 
respiratory patterns in children are limited, we also wished 
to determine the influence of the first night on respiratory 
parameters, and establish whether a single overnight PSG 
suffices to identify the presence and severity of sleep-related 
respiratory disturbances in this age category. 

Finally, we aimed to present normative polysomnographic 
data on sleep, breathing and heart rate (HR) in 
children and adolescents investigated for suspected sleep-
disordered breathing, as a function of age. 

2. Methods 
2.1. Patient population 
The patients were referred to our laboratory for 
evaluation of suspected sleep-disordered breathing, and 
were examined on two consecutive nights (I and II) under 
identical conditions. In 105 children (Group 1) (age 
classes—A: 2–6 years n ¼ 
28; B: 7–13 years n ¼ 
53; C: 
14–17 years n ¼ 
24), no PSG-abnormalities were found. 
This group included 3 post-adenotonsillectomy patients and 
18 patients on nCPAP-therapy. No statistical differences 
were seen between obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome-
patients (OSAS) after/under treatment and children/ 
adolescents with no PSG-abnormalities. In addition, we 
investigated 26 patients (Group 2) with clinically and 
polysomnographically confirmed untreated obstructive 
sleep apnoea (A: n ¼ 
9; B: n ¼ 
12; C: n ¼ 
5). 

Patients with a history of psychiatric or neurologic 
disorders were excluded. 

Written informed consent was obtained from all parents. 
No sedation or sleep deprivation was applied. 

2.2. Polysomnography 
During nocturnal PSG (sleep period time (SPT) 
median 8.3 h, quartile range (qur) 1.1 h), the following 
parameters were recorded: referential electroencephalograms 
(EEG) F4A1, F3A2, submental surface electromyogram 
(EMG), referential electrooculograms 
(‘ROC/A1 and LOC/A2’), surface EMG from the right 
and left tibialis anterior muscle, electrocardiogram 
(ECG), HR from ECG (R–R interval triggered), nasal 
airflow (thermistor), thoracic and abdominal effort (strain 
gauge), oxygen saturation (SaO2) (pulse oximetry, 
Oxycon, Sensormedics, interval for calculations: beat to 
beat), and snoring (microphone). The examinations were 
conducted in accordance with the guidelines in the 
‘Standards and indications for cardiopulmonary sleep 
studies in children’ (American Thoracic Society, 1996). 
The Somnostar 4100 PSG system (Sensormedics) was 
used. Behavior was observed and recorded directly by a 
technician. 

2.3. Analysis of polygraphic recordings 
The following parameters were analyzed: sleep macro-
structure (sleep efficiency (SE), NREM 1–4, REM, REM 
latency (RL)) and sleep microstructure (EEG-and motoric 
arousals/jerks). The computer-aided evaluation (Somnostar 
4100, Sensormedics) of all parameters was checked 
manually (30 s epochs for sleep staging, 2 min epochs for 
respiratory parameters). Sleep was staged in accordance 
with Rechtschaffen and Kales (1968) guidelines adapted 
for age (Scholle and Scha¨fer, 1999). To exclude 
interindividual differences, the staging was done by a 
single person. With regard to EEG-arousals, the definition 
applied to adult PSG (ASDA, 1992) was modified, with 
EEG frequency shifts .1 s being considered (Scholle and 
Zwacka, 2001). Motoric arousals were scored whenever 
activation of the tibialis anterior muscle (jerks) occurred 
together with activation of any other polygraphic 
parameter, for example, HR or EEG. Sleep efficiency 
was defined as total sleep time (TST) divided by time in 
bed (TIB). RL was defined as the period from sleep onset 
to first REM. 

The following respiratory parameters were evaluated: 
obstructive, mixed and central apnoeas and hypopnoeas 
lasting longer than two breaths (Marcus, 1997) were applied 
to calculate the apnoea/hypopnoea-index (AHI) per hour of 
TST. In addition, mean HR and mean SaO2 were calculated. 
HR and SaO2 artifacts were eliminated manually before HR 
and SaO2 were analyzed automatically (Somnostar 4100, 
Sensormedics).

2.4. Statistics 
Descriptive data are presented as the median and quartile 
range. 

Differences between children/adolescents with no PSG-
abnormalities (n ¼ 
84), OSAS patients under/after therapy 
(n ¼ 
21) and OSAS patients not receiving treatment 
(n ¼ 
26) were investigated for the different age classes by 
the Mann and Whitney U-test. 

The two nights were compared using Wilcoxon’s rank 
sum test. 

Differences between the age classes were detected by the 
Kruskal–Wallis test. 

A probability value ( p) of less than 0.05 was considered 
significant. The computer statistical program Statview was 
used. 

3. Results 
There were no significant differences between children/ 
adolescents with no PSG-abnormalities and OSAS patients 
under/after therapy (nCPAP/adenotonsillectomy) and 
OSAS patients in terms of sleep parameters (excluding 
arousal indices), SaO2 and HR. Sleep parameters (excluding 
arousal indices), SaO2 and HR have, therefore, been pooled 
and representative values (medians, qur, minima and 
maxima) for the age classes A, B and C presented in 
Table 1a (n ¼ 
131). 

Significant differences in AHI, EEG-arousal index (AI) 
and motoric arousal index were found between patients with 
no PSG-abnormalities (Group 1: n ¼ 
105) (Table 2a) and 
OSAS patients (Group 2: n ¼ 
26) (Table 2b). 

In the age class A (n ¼ 
37), in all children (Table 1a) 
significantly more wakefulness was seen on the first than on 
the second night (W—I: 3.40% SPT, qur 5.80; II: 1.50% 
SPT, qur 2.47). Time spent in NREM 1–4 did not differ 
significantly between the two nights. There was significantly 
less REM sleep on the first night (I: 16.0% SPT, qur 
10.00; II: 18% SPT, qur 8.00), but the RL was comparable 
on both nights. On the first night, the mean HR was higher 

(I: 72.00/min, qur 10.75; II: 72.00/min, qur 12.25). 
In the age range B (n ¼ 
60), significantly more 
wakefulness was seen on the first than on the second 
night (W—I: 5.15% SPT, qur 10.10; II: 1.05% SPT, qur 
3.20) (Table 1) reflecting a significantly lower sleep 
efficiency (SE—I: 89.00%, qur 13.50; II: 96.00%, qur 
8.00). The percentage of NREM 1 was higher on the first 
night (NREM 1—I: 7.05% SPT, qur 8.80; II: 5.30% SPT, 
qur 8.20), and there was significantly less REM sleep 
(REM—I: 17.00% SPT, qur 5.50; II: 18.50% SPT, qur 
7.50), whereas the RL was comparable on both nights. On 
the first night, the mean HR was higher (I: 65.50/min, qur 
14.00; II: 63.50/min, qur 14.00). 

In the age range C (n ¼ 
34), the differences between the 
two nights reflecting the FNE were similar. First night sleep 

efficiency (SE—I: 94.00%, qur 9.00; II: 96.00%, qur 5.00) 
was lower, the proportion of wakefulness (W—I: 4.85% 
SPT, qur 7.40, II: 2.40% SPT, qur 3.40) was higher, and 
NREM 1 longer (NREM 1—I: 9.30% SPT, qur 9.20; II: 
6.00% SPT, qur 10.40). Furthermore, on the adaptation 
night, the NREM 4 was shorter (NREM 4—I: 14.00% SPT, 
qur 6.30; II: 16.00% SPT, qur 8.00) and the percentage of 
REM sleep smaller (REM—I: 12.00% SPT, qur 8.10; II: 
18.00% SPT, qur 5.00). 

Comparison of the two nights in Groups 1 and 2 
(Table 2a, b), patients revealed no significant differences 
in AHI, mean SaO2 and number of EEG-arousals. On the 
first night, the number of motoric arousals was significantly 
enhanced only in age class A in the group of OSAS 
patients (n ¼ 
9) (I: 14.28/h TST, qur 6.81; II: 12.65/h TST, 
qur 3.75). 

As exemplified in Fig. 1, sleep continuity in the first night 
was usually disturbed. 

Comparison of the age classes A, B and C showed an age 
dependence of the sleep and cardiorespiratory parameters 
(Table 1a, b). With increasing age, a higher proportion of 
NREM 1 was found, especially on the first night. Also, 
NREM 2 was increased on both nights, NREM 3 was 
decreased on the first night and NREM 4 on both nights. A 
lower proportion of REM sleep was found in older children 
on the first night. 

With increasing age, the mean HR decreased. 

In Group 1, lower AHI values, lower AI and lower 
motoric arousal indices (significant only on the first night) 
were found in older patients (Table 2a, c). This age 
dependence was not found in OSAS patients (Group 2) 
(Table 2b, c). 

4. Discussion 
In specialized centres, PSG is routinely performed to 
evaluate children with sleep disturbances, for example 
sleep-disordered breathing. Individual sleep patterns, development-
related changes and technical aspects of sleep 
recording have a considerable influence on the results of 
PSG in children. Methodological aspects of sleep evaluation 
in particular have, however, not yet been adequately 
defined. 

Our study presents polysomnographic data obtained from 
children and adolescents; in comparison with PSG in adults, 
there are some differences in data collection and evaluation. 
Rechtschaffen and Kales (1968) recommended the use of 
central EEG leads for sleep staging. As shown by Kubicki 
et al. (1982), however, frontal leads have advantages over 
central leads. The so-called vertex sharp waves characteristic 
for the end of stage NREM 1 and the beginning of stage 
NREM 2, represent the only pattern undetectable in frontal 
leads. Sleep spindles, K complexes and delta waves are 
adequately recorded in frontal leads. Furthermore, in 
childhood, arousal patterns are more readily recognizable

in frontal than in central or occipital leads (Scholle and 
Scha¨fer, 1999). 

The evaluation of sleep architecture in childhood is 
complicated by the changes in EEG patterns during 
development (American Thoracic Society, 1996; Scholle 
and Scha¨fer, 1999). For example, the posterior basic rhythm 
changes from 2–4 Hz at 2–4 months to 6–7 Hz at 12 
months and 6–8 Hz at 3–5 years, and attains the typical 
alpha rhythm at 12–20 years (Niedermeyer and Lopes da 
Silva, 1992). This gradual change from the theta to the alpha 
frequency band complicates the scoring of brief intrasleep 
wake and arousal periods. For this reason, an additional 
occipital referential EEG lead as proposed for arousal 

scoring in adults (ASDA, 1992) is not helpful in childhood. 
Nevertheless, in childhood, brief wake periods are very easy 
to classify since, in addition to EEG changes, typical HR 
acceleration, changes in respiratory pattern and often a 
motoric activation occur (Scholle and Scha¨fer, 1999). 

As a modification of the definition of arousal in adult 
PSG (ASDA, 1992), EEG frequency shifts greater than 1 s 
were applied (Scholle and Zwacka, 2001). As Mograss et al. 
(1994) showed, most EEG frequency shifts in childhood are 
shorter than 3 s—the minimal duration of an arousal in 
adults (ASDA, 1992). 

The pattern of breathing during sleep changes with 
age. Because children have a higher respiratory rate and

a lower functional residual capacity than adults, we score 
as apnoea cessation of breathing lasting for $2 breaths 
(in adults .10 s), as proposed by Davidson et al. (1996) 
and Marcus (1997). 

Although diagnosing a sleep problem on the basis of a 
single-night recording is common practice (Acebo et al., 
1996), some clinicians caution that more than 1 night of 
recording may be necessary, to enable the patient to 
acclimatize to the unfamiliar environment and sleep more 
naturally (Meyer et al., 1993; Le Bon et al., 2000, 2001; 
Rains, 2001). 

PSG itself represents an external stimulus inducing a 
sleep disturbance, especially on the first night. Sleep is 
typically of reduced quality compared with that in the 
subject’s usual sleep environment with no bothersome 
electrodes and leads. Subjects usually habituate to the 
laboratory by the second night. This FNE described by 
Agnew et al. (1966) in adults is also observable in children. 

Toussaint et al. (1995) reported a varyingly marked FNE 
in different groups, e.g. normal subjects, insomniacs or 
depressed patients. In our study, we investigated children 

and adolescents for sleep-disordered breathing. No patients 
with a history of psychiatric or neurologic disorders were 
included. 

FNE in adults is characterized by a reduction in TST and 
REM sleep, lower sleep efficiency, increased intrasleep 
wake time and longer RL (Rechtschaffen and Verdone, 
1964; Agnew et al., 1966; Hartmann, 1968; Rains, 2001; Le 
Bon et al., 2001). No clear pattern has been identified for 
NREM sleep. Toussaint et al. (1997, 2000) described 
changes in EEG power density during sleep laboratory 
familiarisation. Increased delta, theta and beta 1 power 
densities accompanied by a decrease in mean frequency 
were seen in REM sleep on the second night. Delta and theta 
power density values in the first NREM episode were lower 
on the first night than on the second night. 

In children/adolescents without sleep-disordered breathing, 
treated OSAS patients and OSAS patients not receiving 
therapy, we found no significant difference in sleep structure 
(excluding arousal indices), SaO2 and HR for the age ranges 
2–6, 7–12 and 13–17 years. We, therefore, pooled these 
groups in Table 1a to obtain normative values for these 


S. Scholle et al. / Clinical Neurophysiology 114 (2003) 2138–2145 
parameters on the first and second nights of PSG. In children 
aged 7–12 years and adolescents aged 13–17 years, we 
observed lower sleep efficiency in the first night due to a 
greater percentage of wakefulness during the TIB. As shown 
in Fig. 1, sleep latency is usually longer. FNE is further 
characterized by disturbed sleep continuity, i.e. there are 
numerous brief awakenings. Despite prolongation of NREM 
1 on the first night in the age classes 7–12 and 13–17 years 
and NREM 4 prolongation on the second night in the 13– 
17-year-olds (Table 1a), NREM duration was not significantly 
influenced by the habituation phenomenon—as was 
also described by Le Bon et al. (2001) for adults. In children, 
the first deep sleep period in particular, is not disturbed 
by FNE. 

On the first night, a significantly lower percentage of 
REM sleep was found in all 3 age classes. This may be 
caused by slower adaptation of REM sleep—as described 
for adults—reflecting a more protracted and progressive 
habituation process as compared with NREM sleep (Endo 
et al., 1998). In contrast to adults, first night REM sleep 
latency is not statistically significantly longer. In most 
children, however, the initial sleep cycle is incomplete, with 
no REM phase (Roffwarg et al., 1964; Feinberg and Floyd, 
1979; Palm et al., 1989; Kahn et al., 1996). Thus, in all 3 age 
groups, the time between sleep onset and the first epoch of 
REM is long, but with considerable variability so that 
shortening of REM sleep latency, while demonstrable, is not 
statistically significant (Table 1a). 

The characterization of the microstructure of sleep in 
terms of the EEG-arousals or motoric arousals (Fig. 1) 
appears to be an important marker for sleep disturbances 
in children (Scholle and Zwacka, 2001). But we failed to 
find any statistically significant differences in the number 
of arousals between first and second nights in any of the 3 
age classes. This was true of both Groups 1 and 2, with 
the exception of age class A in Group 2 which had 
significantly more motoric arousals on the fist night 
(Table 2a, b). 

As we show here, the FNE in children is also 
characterized by an elevated mean HR. This statistical 
difference may be accounted for by the higher proportion of 
wakefulness with associated higher HR. 

The effect of the first night of PSG on the next night 
may be compared to partial sleep deprivation (Le Bon et al., 
2001). Toussaint et al. (1997) summarized that the second 
night might be affected by REM sleep deprivation on the 
first night. We are, therefore, of the opinion that FNE can 
be observed only on immediately consecutive nights and 
not in nocturnal polysomnograms performed 7–27 nights 
apart, as described by Katz et al. (2002). This would 
explain why they failed to find night-to-night variability of 
sleep efficiency, arousal index, percent REM, or percent of 
slow wave sleep in children, leading them to reject a FNE 
in this age group. We believe that the interval between the 
first and second examinations in their study was too long to 
identify a FNE. 

Katz et al. (2002) also failed to find any night-to-night 
variability of respiratory parameters. In a group of 26 
children with OSAS (Group 2), we, too, saw no statistically 
significant differences in AHI and mean arterial SaO2 
between the first and second nights, indicating that a single 
polysomnographic night might suffice to demonstrate 
respiratory disturbances. Mendelson (1994) also failed to 
find any differences in AHI, mean minimal arterial oxygen 
desaturation or absolute minimum desaturation between the 
two nights in adults. This is in contrast to the results of Le 
Bon et al. (2000) and Meyer et al. (1993) showing under-
diagnosis of respiratory events in adults when only the first 
night is considered. 

Children show considerable interindividual differences 
in sleep quality. If first night sleep quality is poor, we 
repeat PSG on a second night, even when investigating for 
obstructive sleep apnoea. A repeat study is also mandatory 
when parents report a typical night’s sleep that is at 
variance with our first night findings (American Thoracic 
Society, 1996). 

Webb and Campbell (1979) reported a more pronounced 
FNE in older subjects. This prompted us to determine the 
extent to which age may influence the FNE. We found the 
FNE to be more pronounced in the older children and 
adolescents. In age ranges B and C, differences in sleep 
parameters became progressively more statistically significant—
as Table 1 shows. 

Currently, few polysomnographic reference values are 
available for the pediatric age group (Acebo et al., 1996; 
Davidson et al., 1996; Kahn et al., 1996; Stores et al., 
1998; Katz et al., 2002). In Tables 1a and 2a, b,we 
present normative data on sleep, breathing, oximetry and 
HR in children and adolescents evaluated for sleep-
disordered breathing. We found age-dependency for most 
of these parameters. In common with Kahn et al. (1996), 
we identified a prolongation of NREM 1, an increase in 
the proportion of NREM 2, and a decrease in NREM 3 
and NREM 4. Furthermore, there was a decrease in REM 
sleep in older children/adolescents (Table 1a, b). With 
increasing age, there are fewer apnoeas/hypopnoeas and 
fewer EEG-and motoric arousals (Table 2a–c). This age-
dependency was affected by the FNE and sleep-disordered 
breathing (OSAS). 

The FNE, which represents the sleep-altering effect of 
the monitoring process itself, is demonstrable in both adults 
and childhood. In some cases, the FNE may obscure the 
clinical diagnosis (Rains, 2001). When interpreting polysomnographic 
results, therefore, account must be taken of 
the FNE, as also of the age-dependency of most of the 
physiologic parameters.
