Objective: 
To 
study 
changes 
in 
quality 
of 
life 
in 
children 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
(OSA) 
documented 
by 
full-night 
polysomnography. 


Design 
and 
Setting: 
Prospective 
study 
of 
children 
with 
OSA 
at 
the 
University 
of 
New 
Mexico 
Children’s 
Hospital, 
Albuquerque. 


Methods: 
Caregivers 
for 
children 
were 
asked 
to 
complete 
the 
OSA-18 
quality 
of 
life 
survey 
prior 
to 
polysomnography. 
Children 
who 
met 
inclusion 
criteria 
and 
had 
a 
respiratory 
distress 
index 
higher 
than 
1 
were 
enrolled 
in 
the 
study 
and 
underwent 
adenotonsillectomy. 
Caregivers 
completed 
a 
second 
OSA-18 
survey 
within 
6 
months 
of 
surgery. 
Scores 
from 
the 
preoperative 
and 
postoperative 
surveys 
were 
compared 
using 
the 
paired 
t 
test. 


Results: 
The 
study 
population 
included 
60 
children 
(mean 
age, 
7.1 
[range, 
3-12] 
years), 
of 
whom 
43 
(72%) 
were 
male 
and 
30 
(50%) 
were 
younger 
than 
6 
years. 
Forty-
seven 
children 
(78%) 
had 
a 
respiratory 
distress 
index 
of 
10 
or 
higher. 
The 
mean 
interval 
between 
the 
2 
surveys 
was 
126 
days. 
The 
mean 
total 
OSA-18 
score 
was 
71.4 
before 
surgery 
and 
35.8 
after 
surgery. 
The 
domain 
with 
the 
greatest 
change 
in 
mean 
score 
was 
sleep 
disturbance, 
which 
improved 
by 
11.5. 
The 
changes 
in 
total 
score, 
in 
the 
scores 
for 
each 
domain, 
and 
for 
each 
item 
of 
the 
OSA-18 
survey 
were 
highly 
significant 
(P.002). 


Conclusions: 
Children 
without 
significant 
comorbidities 
show 
a 
marked 
improvement 
in 
the 
domains 
of 
sleep 
disturbance, 
physical 
symptoms, 
emotional 
symptoms, 
and 
daytime 
functioning 
as 
reported 
by 
their 
caregivers 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA.

A
A
DENOTONSILLECTOMY, 
A 
common 
surgical 
procedure, 
has 
traditionally 
been 
used 
for 
the 
relief 
of 
recurrent 
adenotonsillitis 
in 
children. 
Approximately 
274000 
adenotonsillectomies 
were 
performed 
in 
the 
United 
States 
during 
1996,1 
but 
the 
actual 
number 
of 
tonsillectomies 
may 
be 
higher, 
since 
the 
available 
statistics 
are 
based 
on 
data 
for 
ambulatory 
surgery 
alone. 
During 
the 
past 
decade, 
adenotonsillectomy 
has 
been 
used 
with 
increasing 
frequency 
to 
treat 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
(OSA),2 
which 
is 
a 
disorder 
of 
breathing 
during 
sleep 
characterized 
by 
periodic 
obstruction 
of 
the 
upper 
airway 
that 
interferes 
with 
normal 
respiratory 
gas 
exchange 
and 
disturbs 
sleep.3 
The 
estimated 
prevalence 
of 
OSA 
in 
4-year-old 
children 
is 
1% 
to 
3%.4 


Sleep 
disturbance 
is 
children 
is 
a 
spectrum 
of 
disorders 
ranging 
from 
primary 
snoring 
through 
upper 
airway 
resistance 
syndrome 
to 
OSA.5,6 
Children 
with 
pri


mary 
snoring 
have 
normal 
polysomnograms 
with 
no 
evidence 
of 
changes 
in 
alveolar 
ventilation 
or 
sleep 
architecture.5 
Upper 
airway 
resistance 
syndrome 
is 
characterized 
by 
polysomnograms 
that 
show 
increased 
respiratory 
effort 
and 
sleep 
fragmentation 
without 
episodes 
of 
hypopnea 
or 
apnea.6 
Obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
is 
characterized 
by 
intermittent 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
evidenced 
by 
hypopnea 
or 
apnea 
that 
disrupts 
normal 
ventilation 
and 
sleep 
patterns.5,6 
Obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
is 
a 
more 
severe 
disorder 
that 
may 
cause 
cardiorespiratory 
complications 
if 
left 
untreated.
7 
It 
is 
possible 
to 
distinguish 
OSA 
from 
other 
types 
of 
sleep 
disordered 
breathing 
by 
documenting 
hypopnea 
or 
apnea 
during 
full-night 
polysomnography.
8,9 
However, 
polysomnography 
is 
expensive 
and 
time-consuming, 
and 
facilities 
for 
the 
procedure 
are 
not 
available 
in 
all 
institutions.10 
Consequently, 
only 
a 
few 
previous 
studies 
of 
the 
outcome 
of 
surgical 
therapy 
for 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
have 
attempted 
to 
distinguish 
OSA

from 
other 
less 
severe 
sleep 
disturbances.11,12 
These 
studies 
have 
shown 
that 
most 
children 
with 
OSA 
who 
undergo 
adenotonsillectomy 
experience 
resolution 
of 
the 
disorder 
as 
documented 
by 
postoperative 
polysomnography.
11,12 


Even 
though 
postoperative 
polysomnography 
provides 
an 
objective 
estimate 
of 
improvement 
after 
surgery, 
it 
does 
not 
measure 
reduction 
in 
morbidity 
as 
perceived 
by 
caregivers. 
Outcomes 
studies 
using 
a 
validated 
quality 
of 
life 
instrument 
administered 
before 
and 
after 
surgery 
are 
necessary 
to 
evaluate 
this 
change. 
A 
previous 
study 
of 
changes 
in 
quality 
of 
life 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
did 
not 
use 
polysomnography 
for 
the 
diagnosis 
of 
OSA.13 
To 
our 
knowledge, 
the 
present 
study 
is 
the 
first 
to 
examine 
changes 
in 
quality 
of 
life 
in 
children 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA 
documented 
by 
full-night 
polysomnography. 


METHODS
Approval 
for 
this 
study 
was 
obtained 
from 
the 
institutional 
review 
board 
of 
the 
University 
of 
New 
Mexico 
School 
of 
Medicine, 
Albuquerque. 
Children 
referred 
to 
the 
Pediatric 
Otolaryngology 
Service 
with 
a 
sleep 
disturbance 
who 
were 
shown 
to 
have 
OSA 
by 
polysomnography 
were 
included 
in 
the 
study. 
The 
caregivers 
of 
these 
children 
were 
asked 
to 
complete 
an 
informed 
consent 
document 
before 
enrolling 
the 
children 
in 
the 
study. 
Exclusion 
criteria 
included 
(1) 
children 
younger 
than 
3 
years 
or 
older 
than 
12 
years; 
(2) 
children 
who 
previously 
had 
an 
adenotonsillectomy 
or 
polysomnography; 
(3) 
children 
with 
craniofacial 
syndromes, 
neuromuscular 
disease, 
developmental 
delay, 
or 
psychiatric 
disorders; 
and 
(4) 
children 
with 
a 
respiratory 
distress 
index 
(RDI) 
lower 
than 
1. 
A 
total 
of 
68 
children 
were 
included 
in 
the 
study. 


The 
effectiveness 
of 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
the 
relief 
of 
OSA 
was 
evaluated 
using 
the 
OSA-18 
quality 
of 
life 
survey.14 
The 
survey 
(Table 
1) 
comprises 
18 
items 
in 
5 
domains 
of 
sleep 
disturbance, 
physical 
suffering, 
emotional 
distress, 
daytime 
problems, 
and 
caregiver 
concerns. 
The 
domains 
of 
emotional 
distress 
and 
daytime 
problems 
contain 
3 
items, 
while 
the 
other 
domains 
contain 
4. 
A 
point 
scale 
is 
used, 
ranging 
from 
1 
(none 
of 
the 
time) 
to 
7 
(all 
of 
the 
time) 
to 
grade 
the 
relative 
severity 
of 
the 
problem 
addressed 
in 
each 
item. 
The 
total 
score, 
the 
domain 
score, 
and 
the 
item 
score 
were 
recorded. 
A 
single 
quality 
of 
life 
item 
is 
also 
included 
in 
the 
survey. 
This 
item 
asks 
caregivers 
to 
grade 
their 
child’s 
quality 
of 
life 
using 
a 
visual 
analog 
scale 
ranging 
from 
0 
(worse 
possible 
quality 
of 
life) 
to 
10 
(best 
possible 
quality 
of 
life). 
The 
OSA-18 
total 
scores 
on 
the 
first 
survey 
were 
classified 
as 
mild 
(60); 
moderate 
(60 
to 
80); 
or 
severe 
(80).14 
A 
power 
analysis 
indicated 
that 
a 
sample 
size 
of 
60 
is 
adequate 
to 
detect 
a 
10point 
difference 
in 
OSA-18 
total 
score 
with 
80% 
power 
and 


=.05. 
Based 
on 
the 
original 
study 
by 
Franco 
et 
al,14 
a 
change 
in 
OSA-18 
total 
score 
from 
60 
to 
80 
indicates 
a 
change 
from 
moderate 
to 
severe 
impact 
on 
health-related 
quality 
of 
life. 
Therefore, 
the 
present 
study 
has 
more 
than 
sufficient 
power 
to 
detect 
a 
clinically 
important 
change 
in 
health-related 
quality 
of 
life 
based 
on 
OSA-18 
total 
score. 
All 
study 
participants 
underwent 
full-night 
polysomnography15 
to 
document 
OSA. 
The 
following 
parameters 
were 
measured: 
4-channel 
electroencephalography 
with 
bilateral 
central 
and 
occipital 
leads; 
electro-oculography 
to 
measure 
vertical 
and 
horizontal 
eye 
movements; 
electromyography 
with 
sub-
mental 
electrodes; 
electrocardiography; 
airflow 
recording 
through 
the 
nose 
and 
mouth 
by 
a 
nasal 
air 
pressure 
transducer 
with 
end 
tidal 
carbon 
dioxide;

recording 
by 
using 
a 
microphone 
secured 
to 
the 
neck. 
Digital 
videotaping 
with 
sound 
recording 
was 
performed 
throughout 
the 
night. 
A 
sleep 
medicine 
physician 
interpreted 
the 
results 
of 
polysomnography. 
The 
RDI, 
defined 
as 
the 
average 
number 
of 
apneas 
and 
hypopneas 
per 
hour 
of 
sleep, 
was 
used 
for 
diagnosis 
of 
OSA, 
which 
was 
identified 
by 
an 
RDI 
of 
1 
or 
higher. 
Polysomnography 
findings 
were 
classified 
as 
mild 
(RDI 
10); 
moderate 
(RDI 
10 
to 
20); 
or 
severe 
(RDI 
20). 


Caregivers 
were 
asked 
to 
complete 
the 
first 
OSA-18 
survey 
prior 
to 
polysomnography. 
Children 
with 
OSA 
underwent 
a 
monopolar 
Bovie 
adenotonsillectomy. 
Caregivers 
for 
these 
children 
were 
asked 
to 
complete 
the 
OSA-18 
survey 
a 
second 
time 
within 
6 
months 
of 
surgery. 
The 
difference 
score 
was 
derived 
by 
subtracting 
the 
mean 
postsurgical 
score 
from 
the 
mean 
presurgical 
score. 
Since 
a 
decrease 
in 
mean 
score 
implies 
improvement, 
the 
mean 
change 
is 
a 
positive 
number 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
quality 
of 
life, 
where 
improvement 
is 
an 
increase 
in 
score 
and 
the 
mean 
change 
for 
this 
item 
is 
therefore 
negative. 
The 
95% 
confidence 
intervals 
for 
difference 
scores 
were 
also 
calculated. 
The 
standardized 
response 
mean 
(SRM), 
defined 
as 
the 
difference 
score/SD 
of 
the 
difference 
score, 
was 
used 
to 
estimate 
the 
extent 
of 
improvement 
after 
surgery. 
Scores 
from 
the 
preoperative 
and 
postoperative 
results 
of 
the 
OSA-18 
survey 
were 
compared 
using 
SAS 
statistical 
software 
(SAS 
Institute 
Inc, 
Cary, 
NC) 
for 
the 
paired 
t 
test. 


RESULTS
Sixty-eight 
children 
were 
included 
in 
the 
study, 
of 
whom 
4 
were 
lost 
to 
follow-up 
and 
2 
did 
not 
undergo 
surgical 
therapy. 
The 
caregivers 
for 
2 
children 
did 
not 
complete 
the 
postoperative 
OSA-18 
survey. 
As 
a 
consequence, 
the 
study 
population 
included 
60 
children. 
The 
demographics 
of 
these 
children 
and 
the 
results 
of 
polysomnography 
are 
presented 
in 
Table 
2. 
Of 
the 
60 
children, 
43 
(72%) 
were 
male. 
The 
mean 
age 
of 
the 
children 
at 
the 
time 
of 
inclusion 
in 
the 
study 
was 
7.1 
(range, 
3-12) 
years.

was 
in 
the 
domain 
of 
caregiver 
concerns, 
which 
improved 
by 
9.0 
(SRM 
1.2). 
The 
smallest 
mean 
change 
was 
in 
the 
domain 
of 
emotional 
distress, 
which 
improved 
by 
3.5 
(SRM 
0.7). 
The 
mean 
score 
for 
the 
quality 
of 
life 
item 
improved 
by 
1.8 
(SRM 
0.8). 


Among 
the 
individual 
items 
in 
the 
OSA-18 
survey, 
S1 
had 
a 
mean 
change 
of 
3.5 
(SRM 
1.7) 
after 
surgery— 
the 
largest 
improvement 
after 
surgery. 
This 
item 
(Table 
1) 
asks 
whether 
the 
child 
had 
any 
incidents 
of 
loud 
snoring 
during 
the 
past 
4 
weeks. 
Item 
S2 
had 
a 
mean 
change 
of 
2.8 
(SRM 
1.2) 
after 
surgery. 
This 
item 
asks 
if 
there 
have 
been 
any 
incidents 
of 
breath 
holding 
spells 
or 
pauses 
in 
breathing 
at 
night 
during 
the 
past 
4 
weeks. 
The 
smallest 
improvement—a 
change 
of 
0.8—occurred 
in 
item 
P4, 
which 
asks 
if 
the 
child 
has 
had 
any 
difficulty 
swallowing 
foods 
during 
the 
last 
4 
weeks. 


The 
pattern 
of 
change 
in 
the 
OSA-18 
survey 
items 
after 
surgery 
is 
illustrated 
in 
Figure 
1. 
The 
pattern 
of 
scores 
for 
the 
individual 
survey 
items 
is 
remarkably 
similar 
before 
and 
after 
surgery, 
and 
there 
is 
a 
clear 
improvement 
in 
mean 
score 
for 
each 
item. 
For 
example, 
item 
S3, 
which 
addresses 
gasping 
or 
choking 
during 
sleep, 
is 
the 
lowest 
scoring 
item 
in 
the 
sleep 
disturbance 
domain 
both 
before 
and 
after 
surgery. 
The 
total 
score 
of 
the 
survey 
and 
the 
score 
for 
all 
domains 
and 
each 
of 
the 
18 
items 
showed 
a 
significant 
change 
after

provement 
in 
quality 
of 
life 
after 
their 
children 
undergo 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
a 
sleep 
disturbance. 


When 
children 
were 
classified 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
initial 
OSA-18 
total 
score, 
there 
was 
a 
consistent 
relationship 
between 
the 
extent 
of 
improvement 
and 
the 
severity 
of 
the 
sleep 
disturbance 
as 
reported 
by 
the 
caregivers. 
When 
children 
were 
classified 
by 
RDI, 
the 
most 
severely 
affected 
group 
showed 
the 
greatest 
degree 
of 
improvement 
as 
well, 
but 
the 
moderately 
affected 
group 
showed 
the 
least 
improvement. 
This 
implies 
that 
the 
OSA-18 
survey 
and 
polysomnography 
measure 
different 
aspects 
of 
OSA, 
which 
is 
confirmed 
by 
the 
lack 
of 
a 
significant 
correlation 
between 
RDI 
and 
OSA-18 
total 
score. 


Polysomnography 
is 
used 
to 
evaluate 
a 
variety 
of 
physiological 
parameters 
associated 
with 
sleep. 
In 
contrast, 
the 
OSA-18 
survey 
uses 
a 
caregiver 
proxy 
to 
evaluate 
a 
child’s 
behavior. 
There 
are 
a 
number 
of 
reasons 
why 
these 
2 
methods 
of 
evaluation 
might 
not 
generate 
identical 
results. 
For 
example, 
caregivers 
may 
not 
observe 
their 
child 
during 
rapid 
eye 
movement 
sleep 
and 
fail 
to 
note 
the 
peak 
incidence 
of 
apnea 
and 
hypopnea, 
which 
would 
be 
recorded 
during 
polysomnography. 
It 
is 
likely 
that 
the 
best 
approach 
for 
estimating 
improvement 
in 
OSA 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
would 
be 
direct 
evaluation 
of 
a 
child’s 
daytime 
behavior 
with 
psychometric 
methods 
in 
combination 
with 
polysomnography 
to 
evaluate 
sleep 
disturbance. 


The 
present 
study, 
to 
our 
knowledge, 
is 
the 
first 
prospective 
study 
of 
improvements 
in 
quality 
of 
life 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
in 
children 
with 
OSA 
proven 
by 
polysomnography. 
This 
study 
excluded 
children 
with 
milder 
forms 
of 
sleep 
disturbance 
such 
as 
primary 
snoring 
or 
upper 
airway 
resistance.6 
However, 
this 
study 
has 
a 
number 
of 
limitations. 
It 
was 
not 
possible 
to 
use 
a 
control 
group 
of 
children 
who 
were 
diagnosed 
with 
OSA 
but 
did 
not 
undergo 
adenotonsillectomy. 
As 
a 
consequence, 
we 
cannot 
exclude 
the 
possibility 
that 
improvement 
after 
surgery 
was 
due 
in 
part 
to 
a 
tendency 
of 
the 
condition 
to 
improve 
with 
time. 
In 
addition, 
it 
is 
not 
known 
if 
the 
benefits 
of 
surgical 
therapy 
for 
OSA 
last 
beyond 
the 
6-month 
follow-up 
period 
of 
this 
study. 


Children 
with 
significant 
comorbidities 
and 
children 
younger 
than 
3 
years 
were 
excluded 
from 
the 
present 
study. 
Therefore, 
no 
comment 
can 
be 
made 
about 
the 
outcome 
of 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA 
in 
these 
children. 
Furthermore, 
since 
the 
OSA-18 
survey 
was 
validated 
in 
English, 
non-English 
speakers 
were 
excluded, 
and 
this 
introduces 
a 
further 
limitation. 
In 
addition, 
almost 
three 
quarters 
of 
the 
children 
included 
in 
the 
study 
are 
male. 
This 
may 
be 
a 
consequence 
of 
the 
small 
sample 
size, 
but 
it 
is 
conceivable 
that 
some 
aspect 
of 
the 
inclusion 
process 
favors 
male 
subjects. 
In 
spite 
of 
these 
shortcomings, 
the 
improvement 
in 
OSA-18 
scores 
was 
dramatic 
and 
comprehensive, 
suggesting 
that 
caregivers 
perceive 
an 
unequivocal 
benefit 
after 
adenotonsillec


tomy 
for 
OSA 
in 
children 
older 
than 
3 
years 
who 
are 
free 
of 
significant 
comorbidities. 


CONCLUSION
Children 
without 
significant 
comorbidities 
show 
a 
marked 
improvement 
in 
the 
domains 
of 
sleep 
disturbance, 
physical 
symptoms, 
emotional 
symptoms, 
and 
daytime 
functioning 
as 
reported 
by 
their 
caregivers 
after 
adenotonsillectomy 
for 
OSA.
