Objectives. To evaluate sleep quality, sleep-related 
symptoms, and degree of excessive daytime 
sleepiness (EDS) in severe obesity, independently of 
obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS). 
Design. A cross-sectional study. 
Setting. Primary-care setting. 
Subjects, main outcome measures. Anthropometric 
parameters, respiratory function data and sleep 
related symptoms were evaluated in 78 severely 
obese patients (aged 16–75 years) without OSAS 
and in 40 healthy sex-and age-matched normal 
weight subjects, who underwent a full-night 
polysomnography. 
Results. Obese patients and control subjects had 
similar sleep latency and rapid eye movement (REM) 

latency, but they showed lower percentage of REM 
(P < 0.01) and sleep efficiency (P < 0.05) than 
controls. All sleep-related symptoms (observed or 
reported apnoea, awakenings, choking and 
unrefreshing sleep) were significantly more 
frequent in obese patients than in control subjects. 
Loud snoring was present in 46.7% of the obese 
patients and in 8.1% of the control individuals 
(P < 0.01). Excess daytime sleepiness was reported 
by 34.7% of the obese patients and by 2.7% of the 
normal weight subjects (P < 0.01). The Epworth 
Sleepiness Scale (ESS) was higher in the obese group 
than in the control group (P < 0.01), whereas 
arousals were not different between the two groups. 
Conclusions. This study clearly shows that severe 
obesity, even in the absence of OSAS, is associated 
with sleep-related disorders and EDS. All these 
alterations may be partly responsible for a lower 
quality of life, a higher prevalence of medical 
complications, an increased risk of occupational 
injury, and both social and family problems 
characterizing obese patients, independently of the 
presence of OSAS. 

Keywords: excessive daytime sleepiness, severe 
obesity, sleep quality, sleep-related symptoms. 

Introduction 

It has been well established that the prevalence of 
overweight and obesity is progressively increasing in 
USA and in all civilized countries [1, 2]. The 
importance of this finding derives from the fact that 
body fatness, and visceral obesity in particular, is 
associated with adverse health effects, including 

hypertension, coronary heart disease, stroke, insulin 
resistance, type 2 diabetes, osteoarthritis, and psychological 
problems [2]. Respiratory complications 
of obesity tend to be less evident and incorporate 
reduced exercise capacity, hypoxaemia and hypo-
ventilation during sleep. The most common respiratory 
disturbance is the development of upper 
airway obstruction during sleep, which can progress

to frank obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS). 
A previous study performed in patients with severe 
obesity [mean body mass index (BMI) > 42.5] has 
shown that more than 50% of patients without 
reported sleep-related disorders had OSAS [respiratory 
disturbance index (RDI) ‡ 
10 h)1] [3]. Daytime 
sleepiness and fatigue is a frequent complaint of 
obese patients and it is worth noting that patients 
with daytime sleepiness have lower quality of life, a 
higher prevalence of medical complications, and 
greater than twofold higher risk of sustaining an 
occupational injury [4]. Moreover, excessive daytime 
sleepiness (EDS) has been related to several social and 
family problems [5]. Little is known about the sleep 
pattern and the sleep-related symptoms in obese 
people who do not demonstrate sleep apnoea and, at 
the best of our knowledge, the only study which 
examined this issue, found that obese people without 
OSAS (or other sleep-related breathing disorders) 
often report daytime sleepiness and fatigue [6]. 

The aim of this paper was to study the sleep 
quality and the sleep-related symptoms, including 
the degree of daytime sleepiness, in 78 patients with 
severe obesity but free from OSAS, who were 
consecutively referred for the treatment of obesity, 
and in 40 healthy normal-weight subjects, matched 
for age and sex. 

Patients and methods 

Subjects 

A total of 161 obese subjects (BMI ‡ 
30), 57 men and 
104 women aged 16–75 years, were consecutively 
enrolled at the Outpatient Clinic for Obesity, Section 
of Internal Medicine, Endocrinology, and Metabolic 
Diseases, Department of Emergency and Organ 
Transplantation, School of Medicine, University of 
Bari, Bari, Italy, over a period of 4 years. Noteworthy, 
none of these patients had been in a ‘Sleep Centre’ or 
spontaneously reported sleep-related symptoms. 
Forty voluntary subjects, physicians, and students 
without sleep-related symptoms or other pathologies, 
six men and 34 women with BMI < 27, aged 
20–70 years, were enrolled as control subjects. The 
study was approved by the local Ethical Committee, 
and all subjects gave their informed consent. 

Exclusion criteria were: previous diagnosis of sleep 
disorders (inadequate time in bed, insomnia, narcolepsy, 
idiopathic hypersomnolence, shift work, sleep 

apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome, periodic limb movement 
disorders, etc.) or spontaneously complaining 
of sleep disorders. We also excluded all patients who 
could not sleep in supine position or did not reach 
the rapid eye movement (REM) sleep stage during 
the polysomnography or had a total sleep time 
(TST) < 3 h per night. Moreover, the 161 obese 
patients enrolled into the study had no evidence of 
endocrinological or neuromuscular diseases, psychiatric 
disorders, overt cardiopulmonary diseases, 
airway obstruction (FEV1/FVC < 70%), daytime 
hypoventilation, anatomic maxillo-mandibular skeletal 
abnormalities, ear or nose pathology, alcohol 
abuse, or any kind of hypnotic drug. 

Anthropometric parameters 

Central fat accumulation was evaluated by the waist 
circumference, measured midway between the lower 
rib margin and the superior anterior iliac spine. Hip 
circumference was evaluated at the widest circumference 
overt the greater trochanter. The waist-to-hip 
circumference ratio (WHR) was also calculated. Neck 
circumference was measured at the level of the 
cricothyroid membrane. Blood pressure was recorded 
using a mercury sphygmomanometer with an appropriate 
cuff size; the mean level of three measurements 
performed on different days was used. 

Respiratory function data 

A flow volume spirometry was performed with the 
patient in the sitting position using a pneumotachograph 
spyrometer connected to a microcomputer 
system (PK Morgan Ltd, Gillingham, Kent, UK). 
Predicted equations for pulmonary function tests 
were from Vilijanen [7]. 

Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and forced 
vital capacity (FVC) were measured, and the FEV1/ 
FVC ratio was calculated. Functional residual capacity 
(FRC), residual volume (RV) and total lung 
capacity (TLC) were measured by the helium equilibration 
method, by using a pulmonary function 
laboratory 2400¢ 
(Sensor Medics, Bilthoven, The 
Netherlands). The mean of three different determinations 
was recorded for all the above parameters. 

Arterial blood samples for blood gas analysis 
were drawn (brachial or radial artery) after at least 
3 min of rest in the supine position. Arterial blood 
PCO2,PO2, pH and base excess were analysed with 

.

538 O. RESTA et al. 

an automatic acid–base analyser (ABL 30 Radiometer; 
Instrumentation Laboratory, Copenhagen, 
Denmark). 

All the measurements were performed in the 
evening before the sleep study. 

Measurement of sleep-related symptoms 

All subjects (obese and healthy) were evaluated by a 
modified version of the Sleep and Healthy questionnaire 
[8]. As self-reported sleepiness is known to 
underestimate the physiological state of sleepiness 
[9], the questionnaire was answered under the 
supervision of a trained interviewer and in 
the presence of the patient’s partner, if any. The 
questionnaire focused on the snoring, the daytime 
sleepiness and the sleep quality, and the items were: 
1 ‘Has your snoring ever been so loud that it has 
disturbed others?’ [loud snoring (LS)]. 
2 ‘Over the last month, have you experienced sleepiness 
during the day or during your normal working 
hours?’ (excessive daytime sleepiness: (EDS)]; in particular, 
EDS was defined as the propensity for dozing or 
falling asleep in spite of the will of remaining awake. 

The frequency of snoring and daytime sleepiness 
was also quantified [patient score (PS)], and these 
symptoms were scored as follows: no, never ¼ 
0; 
sometimes (one to two times per week) ¼ 
1; often 
(three to four times per week) ¼ 
2; almost always or 
always (five to seven times per week) ¼ 
3. 

The classical Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) [10], 
a simple method validated in both healthy subjects 
and in patients with different sleep disorders, was 
also used to study EDS in our patients. 

Finally, all subjects and their partners were also 
asked: 
1 Has someone observed if you stop breathing 
during the night? (observed or reported apnoea). 
2 Do you wake up during the night? (observed or 
reported awakenings). 
3 Have you noticed choking during the night? 
(observed or reported choking). 
4 When you wake up in the morning, do you feel 
that you have not got enough rest during the night? 
(unrefreshing sleep). 

Polysomnographic data 

All subjects were evaluated in the sleep laboratory of 
the Respiratory Disease Insitute, University of Bari, 

School of Medicine and were monitored continuously 
for 8 h using a 12-channel polysomnograph 
(Vitalog HMS 5000; Vitalog Monitoring Inc., Redwood 
City, CA, USA). Polysomnography was performed 
after a night of adaptation at the Hospital. 
Electroencephalographic, electrooculographic and 
chin electromyographic recordings were obtained 
with surface electrodes according to standard methods 
[11]. 

Airflow was monitored by thermocouples placed 
at the nose and at the mouth. Abdominal and 
ribcage movements were assessed by respiratory 
inductive plethysmography with recording of paradoxical 
breathing. 

Whole-night recordings of haemoglobin oxygen 
saturation were obtained by finger pulse oximetry. 
Snoring sounds were recorded with a microphone 
attached to the neck along with electrocardiogram 
and sleeping position. 

Respiratory events (apnoea or hypopnoea) were 
defined as a cessation or a reduction by two-third 
times of airflow and/or abdominal ribcage movements 
lasting at least 10 s and associated with a 
2.5% decrease in oxygen saturation. 

As most of the events (>85%) were obstructive 
(characterized by increasing ventilatory effort and 
paradoxical breathing), no distinction was made 
between the specific patterns of each apnoea analysis. 


The total number of the respiratory events was 
divided by the TST to obtain the RDI. The TST was 
defined as the time spent in the bed, excluding the 
sleep latency (SL) and the wake time after the onset 
of sleep (total wake time). 

The TSTSaO2 less than 90%, defined as the 
percentage of the TST with oxyhaemoglobin saturation 
less than 90%, was also calculated. 

To simplify the analysis, sleep was divided into 
non-REM (NREM) sleep and REM sleep; both were 
expressed as percentage of the TST. Sleep efficiency 
(SE) was defined as the ratio between the TST and 
the time spent in the bed. Finally, we recorded SL 
and REM latency (L/REM). Electroencephalogram 
(EEG) arousals were detected as a rapid increase in 
EEG frequency lasting >3 s and <15 s and characterized 
by alpha activity and, during REM sleep, by 
an increase in muscle tone [12]. Total number of 
arousals was divided by TST to obtain arousal index 
(AI). Polysomnographic data were recorded according 
to standard criteria [11].

Statistical analysis 

Descriptive statistics were used to summarize subject 
characteristics. Comparison between groups was 
performed by the Student’s t-test for continuous 
variables (age, anthropometric parameters, polysomnographic 
data and ESS). Pearson’s chi-square 
test was used for discrete variables (sex, comparison 
between the groups in relation to sleep-related 
symptoms, snoring and daytime sleepiness). A value 
of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. 
Linear correlations of ESS with age, BMI, neck 
circumference and RDI were also determined in the 
group of obese patients without OSAS. All these 
parameters were normally distributed. The differences 
of anthropometric data, polysomnographic 
findings and arousal index between normal-weight 
subjects and non-OSAS obese patients according to 
sex (Table 3), and the relationship between the 
frequency of snoring and the daytime sleepiness 
(evaluated by the ESS) in non-OSAS obese group 
(Table 4) were evaluated by the anova test. 

Results 

Anthropometric data and polysomnographic findings 

Table 1 shows anthropometric data and polysomnographic 
findings of obese patients with (OSAS 
subjects) and without OSAS (non-OSAS subjects). 
Noteworthy, although patients with OSAS had a 
lower SL and percentage of REM sleep than non-
OSAS subjects, percentage of SE and L/REM were 

similar both in OSAS and non-OSAS. Arousal Index 
(AI) was higher in OSAS than in non-OSAS subjects. 

Table 2 shows the differences in anthropometric 
data, polysomnographic findings, and arousal index 
between normal-weight subjects and obese patients 
without OSAS (non-OSAS). 

Control subjects had lower BMI, neck circumference 
and WHR than non-OSAS patients, whereas 
values of RDI and TST less than 90% were similar to 
non-OSAS group. Sleep latency and L/REM were 
similar in the two groups, whereas both the 
percentage of REM sleep and the SE were lower in 
non-OSAS patients than in healthy subjects. 

Table 3 shows the differences in anthropometric 
data, polysomnographic findings and arousal index 
between normal-weight subjects, and obese patients 
without OSAS (non-OSAS), with each of the two 
groups divided by sex. The results were similar to 
those obtained without evaluating the effect of sex. 

Sleep-related symptoms 

All these sleep-related symptoms were more frequent 
amongst patients of the non-OSAS group. In particular 
(observed or reported) apnoea was present in 
17% of the non-OSAS patients and in 2.5% of the 
control subjects; choking was present in 25% of the 
non-OSAS patients and in 1.0% of the control 
subjects; awakenings were present in 50% of the 
non-OSAS patients and in 3.0% of the control 
subjects; unrefreshing sleep was present in 50% of 
the non-OSAS patients and in 9.0% of the control 
subjects (Fig. 1).

Snoring 

Loud snoring was present in 46.7% of obese subjects 
without apnoea and in 8.1% of control subjects 
(Fig. 2). Similarly, patient score was higher in obese 
non-OSAS as compared with normal weight subjects 

(1.5 vs. 0.6, P < 0.05). 
Daytime sleepiness 

An EDS was reported by 34.7% of the obese non-
OSAS and by one subject (2.7%) of the control group 
(P < 0.01). When the Epworth Sleepiness Scale was 
considered (Fig. 3), the value was 7.7 ± 4.6 in obese 
patients without OSAS and 2.7 ± 2.0 in healthy 
subjects (P < 0.001). 

Interestingly, no significant correlation was found 
between ESS score and age (r ¼ 
0.21), BMI 
(r ¼ 
0.23), neck circumference (r ¼ 
0.21), RDI 
(r ¼ 
0.19), and AI (r ¼ 
0.19) in the obese non-
OSAS group. In the latter group, correlations 
between ESS score and sleep variables were not 
significant (data not shown). However, amongst 
these patients, those reporting loud snoring had 
higher ESS score than those who did not have this 
symptom (7.67 ± 4.5 vs. 4.18 ± 2.86, P ¼ 
0.019). 
Moreover, when the relationship between the frequency 
of snoring and the daytime sleepiness 
(evaluated by the ESS) was studied in the non-OSAS 
obese group by the anova test (Table 4), ESS score 
increased progressively with the severity of reported 
snoring (P ¼ 
0.0169).

Discussion 

The main finding of this study, performed by using 
polysomnographic examination, is that obese subjects, 
even in the absence of OSAS, have significant 
sleep disturbances, such as a higher SL, a lower 
percentage of REM sleep, and a lower SE. Interestingly, 
our data show that obese patients without 
OSAS are similar in terms of percentage of SE and 
L/REM to obese patients with OSAS, thus suggesting 
that obesity per se is associated to sleep alterations. 
Similar results have been reported in a group of 
morbidly obese patients by Vgontzas et al., who did 
not investigate the influence of sex on sleep quality 
[6]. Our sample of non-OSAS obese patients was 
represented by women (mainly) and men, but the 
differences between normal-weight and non-OSAS 
obese groups concerning the sleep quality was not 
influenced by sex.

Obese patients without OSAS had more frequently 
choking, awakenings, unrefreshing sleep and loud 
snoring than normal-weight subjects, thus confirming 
the findings of Vgontzas et al. [6], who showed 
that obese people without OSAS have fragmented 
sleep and a worse quality of sleep as compared with 
nonobese subjects, matched for sex and age. Noteworthy, 
snoring per se is suspected to be a risk factor 
for insulin resistance, hypertension, diabetes and 
cardiovascular risk, and sleep-disordered breathing 
has been suggested to be a component of syndrome 
X [13]. 

Another important finding of our study is that 
about 35% of obese patients without OSAS have 
EDS. This is an important point, as patients with 
daytime sleepiness have a lower quality of life, a 
higher prevalence of medical complications, and a 
greater than twofold higher risk of sustaining an 
occupational injury [4]. EDS is a complaint that has 

. 
2003 Blackwell Publishing Ltd Journal of Internal Medicine 253: 536–543 

recently aroused a large amount of interest, because 
of its relationship to several social and family problems 
[5]. The prevalence rate of EDS in our patients is 
hard to compare with that of other studies, because of 
the obvious difficulty to define the EDS as ‘excessive’. 
The prevalence of EDS varies widely in the studies, 
and it ranges between 0.3 and 13.3% in adults [14]. 
However, it has been found that obesity (as well as 
respiratory symptoms, gender and age) is related to 
the risk of developing daytime sleepiness [15]. In our 
study, we defined EDS as the propensity for dozing or 
falling asleep in spite of the will for remaining awake; 
moreover, according to a modified version of the Sleep 
and Health questionnaire [8], we quantified the 
frequency of these symptoms (patient score). In 
addition, we used the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, a 
simple and validated method which has been tested 
previously in both healthy subjects and patients with 
several kinds of sleep disorders [10]. 
Most of our results confirm those of Vgontzas et al. 
in obese patients without OSAS [6]. To the best of our 
knowledge, the above study is the only one reporting 
data about daytime sleepiness in obese subjects. These 
authors, who used the multiple SL test, found that 
57% of obese patients without sleep apnoea complained 
of daytime sleepiness, more frequently than 
nonobese subjects. Vgontzas et al. did not measure 
arousals and AI in their patients. We measured this 
parameter, but AI was not different between normal 
weight and non-OSAS obese patients and it was not 
associated with ESS in non-OSAS obese patients, thus 
suggesting that low SE in non-OSAS obese patients is 
not due to arousals. 
Our results strongly suggest that a simple interview 
about snoring history may be useful and sufficient to 
obtain an indirect information on the sleepiness of the 
obese patient. Therefore, from a clinical point of view, 
our data reinforce the importance of investigating the 
sleep disturbances and the daytime sleepiness in obese 
patients, even in those without OSAS. In fact, they 
usually underestimate their symptoms and are not 
used to complain spontaneously of their sleep-related 
symptoms and/or their daytime fatigue and sleepiness; 
moreover, they rarely address their clinical 
problems to a sleep centre. Therefore, physicians 
expert in obesity treatment should be educated to 
investigate and to recognize the sleep-related disturbances 
and the daytime sleepiness and to collaborate 
with experts in these problems, and vice versa. 
The pathophysiological mechanism of the sleep 
disturbance in obese patients without OSAS, and of 
EDS in particular, is not clear. The mechanical effects 
of obesity may well play an important role in 
determining sleep disturbances but, unfortunately, 
there is no clear-cut evidence to support this hypothesis. 
Psychological distress is common in obese 
patients [16–18]; however, the possibility that the 
sleep pattern of obese patients reflects a condition of 
psychological distress has been apparently excluded 
by some authors [19]. As obese patients may have a 
condition of hyperarousability during the night and 
hypoarousability during the day [6], another explanation 
may be that daytime sleepiness and nocturnal 
disturbances are manifestations of endocrinological 
and/or metabolic circadian abnormalities. Noteworthy, 
plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines [tumour 
necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and interleukin-6 (IL-6)] are 
elevated in subjects with EDS and, interestingly, the 
levels of these cytokines are higher in obese than in 
normal-weight healthy subjects [20]. Therefore, 
these substances might be responsible for sleep 
disturbances by acting in the brain. Lastly, it may

SLEEP QUALITY IN OBESITY 543 

well be that loud snoring (with associated partial 
awakenings), present in about 50% of our obese 
patients without OSAS, is the key-factor for the 
disruption of sleep architecture and, therefore, for 
EDS. However, two studies concerning snoring and 
sleep patterns reported increased wakefulness but no 
change in sleep architecture in snorers [21,22]. The 
present study shows that obese patients without 
OSAS had higher ESS score if they were habitual 
snorers, and this finding is in line with the results of 
Klink et al. [15], who found that snoring was a 
significant risk factor for EDS. However, Vgontzas 
et al. [6] found no correlation between sleep disturbance 
and snoring. The main difference between the 
present study and that of Vgontzas is that this author 
examined the relationship between polysomnographic 
data and sleepiness, whereas we tested the association 
between reported snoring and ESS. We do not 
have a clear explanation for the difference between 
the above studies but, at the moment, it cannot be 
excluded that snoring per se may have significant 
effects in determining daytime sleepiness. 

In conclusion, severely obese patients free from 
OSAS are characterized by sleep-related disorders, 
such as a lower percentage of REM sleep, a lower SE, 
and more frequent choking, awakenings, unrefreshing 
sleep, and loud snoring. Moreover, most of these 
patients report EDS. Therefore, as all these changes 
may have an important impact on the quality of life 
and on the public safety, and it is quite rare that obese 
patients report sleep-related complaints or refer 
spontaneously to a sleep centre, we would like to 
suggest that physicians should include a short sleep-
history in the clinical assessment of obese patients.
