SUMMARY 
Habitual 
snoring 
is 
associated 
with 
daytime 
symptoms 
like 
tiredness 
and 
behavioral 
problems. 
Its 
association 
with 
sleep 
problems 
is 
unclear. 
We 
aimed 
to 
assess 
associations 
between 
habitual 
snoring 
and 
sleep 
problems 
in 
primary 
school 
children. 
The 
design 
was 
a 
population-based 
cross-sectional 
study 
with 
a 
nested 
cohort 
study. 
The 
setting 
was 
twenty-seven 
primary 
schools 
in 
the 
city 
of 
Hannover, 
Germany. 
Habitual 
snoring 
and 
sleep 
problems 
were 
assessed 
in 
primary 
school 
children 
using 
an 
extended 
version 
of 
Gozal’s 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
questionnaire 
(n 
¼ 
1144). 
Approximately 
1 
year 
later, 
parents 
of 
children 
reported 
to 
snore 
habitually 
(n 
¼ 
114) 
and 
an 
equal 
number 
of 
children 
who 
snored 
never 
or 
occasionally 
were 
given 
the 
Sleep 
Disturbance 
Scale 
for 
Children, 
a 
validated 
questionnaire 
for 
the 
assessment 
of 
pediatric 
sleep 
problems. 
Snoring 
status 
was 
re-assessed 
using 
the 
initial 
questionnaire 
and 
children 
were 
then 
classified 
as 
long-term 
habitual 
snorers 
or 
ex-habitual 
snorers. 
An 
increasing 
prevalence 
of 
sleep 
problems 
was 
found 
with 
increasing 
snoring 
frequency 
for 
sleep-onset 
delay, 
night 
awakenings, 
and 
nightmares. 
Long-term 
habitual 
snorers 
were 
at 
significantly 
increased 
risk 
for 
sleep–wake 
transition 
disorders 
(e.g. 
rhythmic 
movements, 
hypnic 
jerks, 
sleeptalking, 
bruxism; 
odds 
ratio, 
95% 
confidence 
interval: 
12.0, 
3.8–37.3), 
sleep 
hyperhidrosis 
(3.6, 
1.2–10.8), 
disorders 
of 
arousal/ 
nightmares 
(e.g. 
sleepwalking, 
sleep 
terrors, 
nightmares; 
4.6, 
1.3–15.6), 
and 
excessive 
somnolence 
(i.e. 
difficulty 
waking 
up, 
morning 
tiredness, 
daytime 
somnolence; 
6.3, 
2.2– 
17.8). 
Ex-habitual 
snorers 
were 
at 
increased 
risk 
for 
sleep–wake 
transition 
disorders 
(4.4, 
1.4–14.2). 
Habitual 
snoring 
was 
associated 
with 
several 
sleep 
problems 
in 
our 
study. 
Long-term 
habitual 
snorers 
were 
more 
likely 
to 
have 
sleep 
problems 
than 
children 
who 
had 
stopped 
snoring 
spontaneously.

frequently 
in 
children 
suffering 
from 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea. 
Ipsiroglu 
et 
al. 
(2001) 
reported 
night 
awakenings, 
nightmares, 
and 
sleepwalking 
associated 
with 
snoring. 
No 
study 
has 
yet 
investigated 
this 
issue 
longitudinally. 


We 
designed 
and 
performed 
a 
population-based 
cross-
sectional 
study 
on 
the 
prevalence 
of 
SDB 
and 
its 
association 
with 
sleep 
problems, 
daytime 
symptoms, 
and 
school 
performance 
in 
school-aged 
children 
(Schlaud 
et 
al., 
2004). 
We 
also 
performed 
a 
follow-up 
study 
using 
cohorts 
from 
the 
original 
study 
sample 
to 
investigate 
the 
natural 
history 
of 
snoring 
(Urschitz 
et 
al., 
2004b) 
and 
associated 
behavioral 
problems 
(Urschitz 
et 
al., 
2004a). 
In 
this 
report 
from 
that 
study 
our 
hypothesis 
was 
that 
snoring 
is 
associated 
with 
sleep 
problems. 
We 
were 
also 
interested 
in 
associations 
between 
night-and 
daytime 
symptoms 
among 
snorers. 
This 
may 
help 
to 
better 
understand 
the 
underlying 
mechanisms 
of 
daytime 
symptoms 
like 
tiredness 
or 
sleepiness. 


METHODS 


Subjects 
and 
study 
enrollment 


For 
this 
study 
27 
of 
the 
59 
public 
primary 
schools 
located 
within 
the 
city 
limits 
of 
Hannover, 
Germany, 
were 
selected 
at 
random 
within 
strata 
of 
average 
socio-economic 
status 
of 
parents. 
Following 
approval 
by 
the 
institutional 
review 
board 
and 
the 
regional 
directorate 
of 
education, 
all 
children 
attending 
third-grade 
classes 
in 
these 
schools 
(n 
¼ 
1760) 
were 
identified. 
During 
the 
year 
2001, 
pupils 
were 
contacted 
in 
their 
classrooms 
by 
two 
investigators 
and 
a 
cover 
letter 
explaining 
the 
study, 
an 
informed 
consent 
form 
and 
a 
questionnaire 
on 
symptoms 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
(sleep-disordered 
breathing 
questionnaire, 
SDBQ) 
given 
to 
the 
children 
to 
be 
filled 
in 
by 
their 
parents. 
Questionnaires 
were 
collected 
by 
the 
classroom 
teacher 
and 
picked 
up 
by 
a 
study 
crewmember 
1–2 
weeks 
after 
the 
initial 
visit. 
Finally, 
1144 
children 
(65.0%) 
participated 
in 
the 
study. 
Comparisons 
to 
all 
eligible 
third 
graders 
(n 
¼ 
1760) 
and 
the 
underlying 
source 
population 
of 
third 
graders 
(n 
¼ 
3809) 
revealed 
good 
to 
excellent 
representativeness 
concerning 
gender 
distribution, 
socioeconomic 
status, 
academic 
performance, 
and 
diagnosis 
of 
asthma 
(Schlaud 
et 
al., 
2004). 
Further 
detail 
on 
the 
recruitment 
strategy 
and 
basic 
characteristics 
of 
the 
study 
sample 
are 
published 
elsewhere 
(Schlaud 
et 
al., 
2004; 
Urschitz 
et 
al., 
2003). 


Sleep-disordered 
breathing 
questionnaire 


The 
SDBQ 
was 
administered 
using 
an 
extended 
version 
of 
Gozal’s 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
questionnaire 
(Gozal, 
1998; 
Gozal 
and 
Pope, 
2001; 
O’Brien 
et 
al., 
2004). 
The 
questionnaire 
included 
questions 
on 
gender, 
age 
and 
parental 
graduation 
from 
school. 
Snoring 
was 
investigated 
with 
the 
following 
question: 
Does 
your 
child 
snore?. 
Responses 
were 
rated 
on 
a 
4-point 
rating-scale 
(never, 
occasionally, 
frequently, 
always). 
Children 
were 
classified 
as 
habitual 
snorers 
if 
the 
answer 
was 
frequently. 
or 
always. 


The 
SDBQ 
also 
comprised 
items 
on 
common 
sleep 
problems 
in 
children. 
Five 
sleep 
problems 
– 
sleep-onset 
delays, 
night 
awakenings, 
sleepwalking, 
nightmares 
and 
bedwetting 
– 
were 
assessed. 
These 
sleep 
problems 
were 
chosen 
because 
they 
have 
been 
reported 
to 
be 
the 
most 
frequent 
problems 
in 
children 
(Paavonen 
et 
al., 
2000). 
Response 
categories 
were 
taken 
from 
the 
Children’s 
Sleep 
Habits 
Questionnaire 
(Owens 
et 
al., 
2000). 
Answers 
were 
rated 
on 
a 
3-point 
scale 
(never/rarely, 
sometimes, 
often). 
A 
more 
detailed 
description 
of 
the 
SDBQ 
is 
given 
elsewhere 
(Schlaud 
et 
al., 
2004). 


Follow-up 


Approximately 
1 
year 
later 
(2002), 
snoring 
status 
was 
reassessed 
in 
all 
habitual 
snorers 
among 
the 
study 
sample 
(n 
¼ 
114) 
using 
the 
SDBQ 
again. 
In 
addition, 
sleep 
problems 
were 
evaluated 
more 
extensively 
using 
a 
German 
version 
of 
the 
Sleep 
Disturbance 
Scale 
for 
Children 
(SDSC), 
an 
instrument 
for 
assessing 
the 
frequency 
of 
sleep 
problems 
in 
children 
(Bruni 
et 
al., 
1996). 
The 
SDSC 
consists 
of 
26 
items 
grouped 
into 
six 
subscales: 
disorders 
of 
initiating 
and 
maintaining 
sleep 
(DIMS), 
disorders 
of 
arousal/nightmares 
(DA), 
sleep–wake 
transition 
disorders 
(SWTD), 
disorders 
of 
excessive 
somnolence 
(DOES), 
and 
sleep 
hyperhydrosis 
(SHY). 
The 
sixth 
subscale 
(sleep 
breathing 
disorders) 
was 
not 
considered 
and 
the 
total 
sleep 
problems. 
score 
was 
calculated 
without 
this 
subscale. 
Both, 
the 
SDBQ 
and 
the 
SDSC 
were 
mailed 
to 
the 
children’s 
homes. 
In 
addition, 
they 
were 
also 
sent 
to 
114 
sex-
and 
school-matched 
non-snoring 
controls 
randomly 
chosen 
from 
the 
initial 
study 
sample 
(107 
children 
had 
initially 
never. 
snored 
and 
7 
had 
snored 
occasionally). 


Statistics 


All 
analyses 
were 
done 
with 
statistical 
software 
(Statistical 
Package 
for 
the 
Social 
Science, 
release 
11.0 
for 
Windows; 
SPSS, 
Chicago, 
IL, 
USA). 
Descriptive 
statistics 
were 
used 
to 
summarize 
subject 
characteristics 
and 
questionnaire 
results. 
Based 
on 
data 
from 
the 
controls, 
scores 
for 
each 
SDSC 
subscale 
were 
grouped 
either 
into 
a 
normal 
score 
range 
(i.e. 
problem 
absent) 
or 
into 
an 
abnormal 
score 
range 
(i.e. 
problem 
present) 
using 
90th 
percentiles 
for 
cut 
off. 
Comparisons 
between 
distributions 
were 
done 
using 
Kruskall–Wallis 
and 
Pearson’s 
v 
2 
test 
for 
trend 
where 
appropriate. 
Associations 
between 
SDSC 
night-time 
subscales 
and 
DOES 
were 
investigated 
using 
Spearman’s 
correlation 
coefficient. 
To 
quantify 
potential 
associations 
between 
snoring 
categories 
and 
sleep 
problems, 
odds 
ratios 
(OR) 
and 
their 
95% 
confidence 
intervals 
(95% 
CI) 
were 
calculated 
using 
unconditional 
logistic 
regression. 
Logistic 
models 
were 
adjusted 
for 
gender 
and 
age. 
A 
P-value 
of 
<0.05 
was 
considered 
statistically 
significant.

585 
(51.1%) 
were

Mean 
age 
[standard 
deviation 
(SD)] 
of 
the 
study 
sample 
was 


9.6 
years 
(0.66). 
Information 
on 
snoring 
was 
available 
for 
1129 
children 
(98.7%). 
In 
total, 
410 
and 
605 
children 
were 
reported 
to 
snore 
never. 
or 
occasionally, 
and 
114 
were 
classified 
as 
habitual 
snorers. 
Analysis 
of 
the 
data 
revealed 
an 
increasing 
frequency 
of 
sleep-onset 
delays, 
night 
awakenings, 
nightmares, 
and 
bedwetting 
with 
higher 
frequency 
of 
snoring. 
Only 
the 
associations 
between 
the 
frequency 
of 
sleep-onset 
delay, 
night 
awakening, 
nightmares, 
and 
the 
frequency 
of 
snoring 
were 
statistically 
significant. 
Moreover, 
there 
was 
a 
trend 
for 
bedwetting 
but 
not 
for 
sleepwalking 
(Table 
1). 
Follow-up 
results 
were 
available 
for 
82 
habitual 
snorers 
(72%) 
and 
for 
80 
controls 
(70%). 
Mean 
time 
(SD) 
between 
filling 
in 
the 
initial 
and 
the 
follow-up 
SDBQ 
was 


13.5 
months 
(3.1). 
On 
average, 
follow-up 
participants 
had 
higher 
educated 
mothers 
compared 
with 
non-participants 
(prevalence 
of 
educational 
level 
4: 
16% 
versus 
4%), 
but 
did 
not 
differ 
in 
any 
other 
basic 
characteristic 
(i.e. 
gender, 
age, 
body 
mass 
index, 
paternal 
education). 
At 
the 
1-year 
follow-
up, 
40 
of 
the 
former 
114 
habitual 
snorers 
still 
snored 
habitually 
(long-term 
habitual 
snorers), 
while 
42 
had 
stopped 
snoring 
(ex-habitual 
snorers). 
Two 
subjects 
in 
each 
group 
had 
received 
treatment 
(i.e. 
adenotonsillectomy) 
in 
the 
interim 
period. 
All 
SDSC 
subscales 
showed 
higher 
values 
in 
the 
long-term 
habitual 
snoring 
group 
compared 
with 
the 
other 
groups 
(Table 
2), 
which 
was 
statistically 
significant 
for 
SWTD, 
DOES, 
and 
SHY. 
However, 
except 
for 
the 
SWTD, 
the 
difference 
between 
long-term 
habitual 
snorers

DISCUSSION 


In 
our 
population-based 
sample 
of 
school-aged 
children, 
sleep-onset 
delays, 
night 
awakenings, 
and 
nightmares 
were 
more 
frequent 
in 
habitually 
snoring 
children. 
In 
a 
follow-up 
assessment 
using 
a 
validated 
sleep 
problem 
questionnaire, 
we 
also 
found 
long-term 
habitual 
snorers 
to 
be 
at 
increased 
risk 
for 
sleep–wake 
transition 
disorders 
(i.e. 
rhythmic 
movements, 
hypnic 
jerks, 
sleeptalking, 
bruxism), 
sleep 
hyperhidrosis, 
disorders 
of 
arousal/nightmares 
(i.e. 
sleepwalking, 
sleep 
terrors, 
nightmares), 
and 
excessive 
somnolence 
(i.e. 
difficulty 
waking 
up, 
morning 
tiredness, 
daytime 
somnolence). 
The 
previous 
finding 
in 
our 
cross-section 
of 
more 
frequent 
sleep-
onset 
delays 
and 
night 
awakenings, 
however, 
was 
not 
confirmed 
by 
the 
follow-up 
study. 
This 
may 
be 
related 
to 
the 
relative 
small 
sample 
size. 
Taken 
together, 
our 
study 
concurs 
with 
others 
suggesting 
that 
both 
day-and 
night-time 
symptoms 
occur 
more 
frequently 
in 
snorers 
which 
may 
impair 
sleep 
quality 
and 
daytime 
performance 
in 
affected 
children. 


Daytime 
symptoms 
associated 
with 
snoring 
or 
SDB 
have 
been 
investigated 
by 
several 
groups 
(Ali 
et 
al., 
1994; 
Archbold 
et 
al., 
2002; 
Chervin 
et 
al., 
1997, 
2002; 
Rosen, 
1999, 
Guilleminault 
et 
al., 
1976; 
Urschitz 
et 
al., 
2003). 
Daytime 
tiredness 
and/or 
sleepiness, 
a 
major 
symptom 
in 
adult 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
syndrome 
(Marcus, 
2000), 
has 
also 
been 
reported 
in 
children 
with 
habitual 
snoring 
or 
SDB 
(Archbold 
et 
al., 
2002; 
Rosen, 
1999). 
The 
causal 
pathway 
between 
SDB 
and 
daytime 
somnolence, 
however, 
is 
yet 
poorly 
understood. 
Sleep 
disruption 
and/or 
blood 
gas 
abnormalities 
are 
suggested 
to 
prevent 
sleep-related 
restorative 
processes 
and 
further 
induce 
structural 
central 
nervous 
system 
cellular 
injury 
(Beebe 
and 
Gozal, 
2002). 
This, 
in 
turn, 
may 
lead 
to 
dysfunction 
of 
prefrontal 
regions 
of 
the 
brain 
cortex 
manifested 
in 
executive 
dysfunction 
and 
resulting 
in 
maladaptive 
daytime 
behavior. 
In 
our 
study, 
we 
found 
an 
association 
between 
sleep–wake 
transition

disorders 
and 
excessive 
somnolence 
in 
habitual 
snorers. 
Adjusted 
regression 
analysis 
revealed 
that 
sleep–wake 
transition 
disorders 
but 
no 
other 
sleep 
problem 
were 
confounders 
in 
the 
association 
between 
snoring 
and 
daytime 
tiredness. 
There 
are 
two 
potential 
explanations 
for 
this 
finding: 
(i) 
snoring 
evokes 
sleep–wake 
transition 
disorders 
like 
rhythmic 
body 
or 
periodic 
leg 
movements 
via 
sleep 
disruption 
and 
in 
turn 
impairs 
sleep 
quality 
and 
restorative 
processes 
resulting 
in 
daytime 
tiredness 
(i.e. 
sleep–wake 
transition 
disorders 
are 
on 
the 
causal 
pathway 
between 
snoring 
and 
daytime 
tiredness); 


(ii) 
snoring 
leads 
to 
daytime 
tiredness 
apart 
from 
other 
sleep 
problems, 
and 
sleep–wake 
transition 
disorders 
are 
only 
a 
marker 
for 
particularly 
susceptible 
individuals 
(i.e. 
sleep–wake 
transition 
disorders 
are 
not 
on 
the 
causal 
pathway). 
However, 
as 
the 
method 
of 
this 
study 
does 
not 
allow 
to 
clarify 
this, 
more 
studies 
are 
needed 
to 
understand 
the 
development 
of 
daytime 
tiredness 
in 
snoring 
children. 
Compared 
with 
habitual 
snorers, 
children 
who 
had 
spontaneously 
ceased 
to 
snore 
habitually 
(i.e. 
ex-habitual 
snorers) 
showed 
fewer 
sleep 
problems 
but 
were 
still 
at 
increased 
risk 
for 
sleep–wake 
transition 
disorders. 
Assuming 
a 
causal 
relationship 
between 
snoring 
and 
sleep 
problems, 
one 
would 
expect 
a 
significant 
improvement 
in 
sleep 
quality 
and 
decrease 
in 
the 
frequency 
of 
sleep 
problems 
with 
snoring 
cessation. 
This 
assumption 
is 
supported 
by 
our 
data 
and 
may 
help 
to 
establish 
this 
causal 
relationship, 
although 
the 
methods 
applied 
do 
not 
allow 
to 
prove 
causality. 
To 
better 
understand 
this 
issue, 
longitudinal 
studies 
on 
the 
order 
of 
occurrence 
of 
sleep 
problems 
and 
snoring 
are 
required. 
However, 
the 
ongoing 
association 
between 
ex-habitual 
snoring 
and 
sleep– 
wake 
transition 
disorders 
found 
in 
our 
study 
may 
indicate 
a 
residual 
sequel 
of 
habitual 
snoring. 
Little 
is 
known 
about 
long-term 
consequences 
of 
snoring. 
One 
study 
reported 
impaired 
school 
performance 
years 
after 
snoring 
termination 
(Gozal 
and 
Pope, 
2001). 
This 
supports 
the 
concern 
that 
snoring 
has 
long-term 
effects 
in 
children 
and 
should 
be 
considered 
in 
future 
research. 


This 
study 
has 
major 
limitations. 
Data 
on 
snoring 
and 
sleep 
problems 
were 
based 
on 
parental 
questionnaires 
and 
not 
ascertained 
with 
objective 
measures. 
In 
addition, 
we 
did 
not 
investigate 
the 
severity 
of 
SDB, 
which 
can 
range 
from 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
syndrome 
to 
primary 
snoring. 
A 
differentiation 
in 
SDB 
severity 
may 
have 
provided 
a 
better 
explanation 
for 
different 
results 
between 
long-term 
and 
ex-
habitual 
snorers. 
Due 
to 
the 
different 
questionnaires 
used 
at 
the 
first 
and 
second 
assessment, 
results 
on 
sleep 
problems 
cannot 
be 
directly 
compared. 
Only 
snoring 
status 
was 
assessed 
at 
both 
time 
points 
using 
the 
same 
instrument. 
Therefore, 
differences 
between 
long-term 
and 
ex-habitual 
snorers 
at 
the 
first 
assessment 
could 
not 
be 
investigated 
properly. 
The 
SDBQ 
has 
yet 
only 
been 
incompletely 
validated. 
Sleep 
problems 
may 
have 
been 
under-or 
overestimated. 
Our 
study 
focused 
on 
third 
graders 
which 
may 
limit 
its 
generalizability. 
Finally, 
30% 
of 
subjects 
identified 
in 
the 
follow-up 
study 
did 
not 
complete 
the 
questionnaires. 
The 
impact 
of 
these 
non-participants 
remains 
unclear.

CONCLUSION 


Habitual 
snoring 
in 
children 
may 
be 
associated 
with 
several 
sleep 
problems 
as 
well 
as 
with 
daytime 
tiredness 
and 
sleepiness. 
When 
snoring 
ceases, 
both 
daytime 
somnolence 
and 
most 
sleep 
problems 
likely 
resolve. 
This 
study 
supports 
the 
assumption 
that 
snoring 
leads 
to 
day-and 
night-time 
symptoms 
in 
children, 
although 
the 
methods 
applied 
are 
unable 
to 
prove 
causality. 
Although 
half 
of 
the 
habitual 
snorers 
may 
stop 
their 
snoring 
spontaneously 
after 
1 
year, 
some 
may 
still 
show 
residual 
night-time 
disturbance. 
This 
may 
be 
due 
to 
long-term 
effects 
of 
snoring 
in 
childhood. 
Major 
sleep 
problems 
in 
snorers 
are 
sleep–wake 
transition 
disorders 
like 
rhythmic 
body 
and 
limb 
movements. 
They 
may 
be 
of 
particular 
importance, 
because 
they 
may 
bridge 
the 
snoring-induced 
sleep 
impairment 
and 
the 
daytime 
tiredness/sleepiness.
