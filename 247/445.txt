OBJECTIVE: To study changes in sleep behavior and 
quality of life in obese children after adenotonsillectomy 
for obstructive sleep apnea. 
STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective study at 
the University of New Mexico Children’s Hospital. 
METHODS: Children who met inclusion criteria and 
had a respiratory distress index (RDI) greater than 5 
were enrolled in the study and underwent adenotonsillectomy. 
All children underwent preoperative 
and postoperative full-night polysomnography. 
Age-and gender-specific percentile BMI was recorded 
at the time of polysomnography. Caregivers 
were asked to complete an OSA-18 quality of 
life survey prior to polysomnography and a second 
survey within 6 months of surgery. Scores from preoperative 
and postoperative polysomnography 
and OSA-18 surveys were compared using the 
paired Student’s t test. 
RESULTS: The study population included 30 children. 
Twenty-six children (86%) were male. The mean 
age of the children at the time of inclusion in the 
study was 9.3 years; range, 3.0 to 17.2. The mean 
preoperative BMI was 28.6 (range, 19.2 to 47.1) and 
the mean postoperative BMI was 27.9 (range, 17.8 
to 27.9). A 2-tailed paired t test showed that this 
difference is not statistically significant (P . 
0.06). 
The mean preoperative RDI was 30.0 and the mean 
postoperative RDI was 11.6 (P < 0.001). The preoperative 
mean total OSA-18 score was 78.2 and the 
postoperative mean total score was 39.8 (P < 
0.001). 
CONCLUSION: Obese children with OSA who undergo 
adenotonsillectomy show a marked improvement 
in RDI and in quality of life with no 
change in BMI. However, in the majority of children, 
OSA does not resolve. (Otolaryngol Head Neck

The prevalence of childhood obesity, defined as an 
age-and gender-specific body mass index (BMI) 
greater than the 95th percentile, has risen from 6% to 
14% over the last quarter century in the United 
States.1,2 Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) occurs frequently 
in obese children who have adenotonsillar hypertrophy. 
The prevalence of OSA in these children 
appears to be between 30% and 40%.3,4 In the general 
pediatric population, the prevalence of OSA is approximately 
1%.5 

The high prevalence of OSA in obese children is 
associated with a decrease in the cross-sectional area of 
the pharynx. The cause of this decrease is multifactorial. 
Childhood obesity is associated with narrowing of the 
upper airway caused by adipose tissue adjacent to the 
pharyngeal airway.6 In addition, there may be external 
compression of the upper airway by fat in the subcutaneous 
tissues of the neck.7 Enlarged tonsils and adenoids in 
obese children further decrease the cross-sectional area of 
the pharynx.4 

Over the past 20 years the principal indication for 
adenotonsillectomy in children has changed from recurrent 
adenotonsillitis to OSA.8 The increasing prevalence 
of obesity in children and the high prevalence of 
OSA in obese children implies that an increasing number 
of these children will present for adenotonsillectomy. 
The present study examines changes in the physiological 
parameters of sleep and in quality of life after 
adenotonsillectomy for OSA in obese children. Recent 
studies have shown that adenotonsillectomy produces 
an improvement in the physiological parameters of 
sleep9 and a dramatic change in quality of life10,11 in 
the general population of children with OSA. The goal 
of this study is to establish the outcome of surgery for 
OSA in obese children. 

METHODS 

Approval for this study was obtained from the Institutional 
Review Board of the University of New 
Mexico School of Medicine. Children with a sleep 
disturbance who were shown to have obstructive sleep 
apnea by polysomnography and an age-and gender-
specific BMI greater than the 95th percentile12 were 
included in the study. The caregivers of these children 
were asked to complete an informed consent document 
before enrolling the children in the study. Exclusion 
criteria included: 1) children less than 3 or greater than 
18 years of age; 2) children who had a previous adeno

tonsillectomy; 3) children with craniofacial syndromes, 
neuromuscular disease, developmental delay, or psychiatric 
disorders; 4) children with a respiratory distress 
index (RDI) less than 5. 

The effectiveness of adenotonsillectomy for obstructive 
sleep apnea was evaluated using polysomnography13 
and the OSA-18 Quality of Life Survey (OSA18).
14 All study participants underwent full-night 
polysomnography (PSG) to document obstructive sleep 
apnea.15 The RDI, defined as the average number of 
apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep, was used for 
diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea. A sleep medicine 
physician interpreted the results of polysomnography. 
Polysomnography findings were classified as mild 
(RDI . 
5 10), moderate (RDI . 
10 20), or severe 
(RDI . 
20). Children with an RDI greater than or equal 
to 5 were included in the study. 

The OSA-18 survey comprises 18 items in 5 domains 
of sleep disturbance, physical suffering, emotional 
distress, daytime problems, and caregiver concerns. 
The domains of emotional distress and daytime 
problems contain 3 items while the other domains contain 
4. A point scale is used ranging from 1 (none of 
the time) to 7 (all of the time) to grade the relative 
severity of the problem addressed in each item. The 
total score and the domain scores were recorded. A 
power analysis indicated that a sample size of 30 is 
adequate to detect a 20-point difference in OSA-18 
total score and a difference of 10 in RDI with 80% 
power and 0.05. Based on the original study by 
Franco et al,14 a change in OSA-18 total score from 60 
to 80 indicates a change from moderate to severe impact 
on health-related quality of life. A change in RDI 
from 10 to 20 indicates a change from moderate to 
severe OSA.16 Therefore, the present study has sufficient 
power to detect a clinically significant change in 
health-related quality of life based on OSA-18 total 
score and in the physiological parameters of sleep as 
measured by RDI. 

Caregivers were asked to complete the first OSA-18 
survey prior to polysomnography. Children with OSA 
underwent a monopolar Bovie adenotonsillectomy. 
Postoperative polysomnography was performed on all 
children enrolled in the study within a mean interval of 

5.6 months. Caregivers were asked to complete the 
OSA-18 survey a second time within a mean interval of 
2.4 months after surgery. The difference score was 
derived by subtracting the mean postoperative OSA-18 
score from the mean preoperative score. The standardized 
response mean (SRM), defined as the difference 
score/standard deviation of the difference score, was 
used to document the extent of improvement after surgery.

were also calculated. The two-tailed paired Student’s t 
test was used to evaluate the significance of differences 
in the preoperative and postoperative OSA-18 surveys. 
The same test was used to evaluate the significance of 
differences in preoperative and postoperative BMI and 
RDI. A P value less than 0.05 was considered to be 
significant. 

RESULTS 

Forty-six children were included in the study. Eight 
of these children were lost to follow-up, 4 others did 
not have postoperative PSG, 2 did not undergo surgical 
therapy, and the caregivers for 2 children did not complete 
the postoperative OSA-18 survey. As a consequence, 
the study population included 30 children. 
Twenty-six of the children (86%) were male. The mean 
age of the children at the time of inclusion in the study 
was 9.3 years, and the range was 3 to 17.2 years. 
Eighteen children were Hispanic or Latino, 9 children 
were non-Hispanic or Latino White, 2 were Native 
Americans, and in 1 child the ethnicity was described 
as “other.” The most common comorbidities were 
asthma in 13 children (43%) and allergies in 12 children 
(40%). The mean preoperative BMI was 28.6 
(range, 19.2 to 47.1) and the mean postoperative BMI 
was 27.9 (range, 17.8 to 27.9). The results of a two-
tailed paired Student’s t test show that this difference in

was 1.7 months. The mean interval between surgery 
and the second survey was 2.4 months. The mean 
interval between the 2 surveys was 4.1 months. The

the basis of the preoperative PSG, 6 children (20%) had 
mild OSA, 10 children (33%) had moderate OSA, and 
14 children (46%) had severe OSA. The postoperative

children (23%) had moderate OSA, and 4 children 
(13%) had severe OSA after surgery. 

OSA-18 total and domain scores before and after 
adenotonsillectomy for obstructive sleep apnea are presented 
in Table 3. The total OSA-18 score and the 
scores for all domains showed improvement after surgery. 
The mean total OSA-18 score before surgery was 

78.2 (95% CI 70.4 to 86.1) and after surgery was 39.8 
(95% CI 32.3 to 47.3). The SRM for the difference in 
total score was 1.71. The domain with the greatest 
change in mean score was sleep disturbance (SRM 
1.84). The second-greatest mean change was in the 
domain of caregiver concerns (SRM 1.50). The smallest 
mean change was in the domain of emotional distress 
(SRM 0.66). These differences in preoperative and 
postoperative total scores and domain scores are significant 
(P . 
0.0001). 
The pattern of change in the domains of the OSA-18 
survey after surgery is illustrated graphically in Figure 

1. There is a marked improvement for each mean 
domain score after surgery. 
DISCUSSION 

This study confirms that obese children with OSA 
have a clear improvement in physiological parameters 
of sleep and in quality of life after adenotonsillectomy. 
The decrease in mean RDI after surgery was from 30.0 
to 11.6. This represents a clinically significant change 
from severe to moderate OSA.15,16 The changes in 
quality of life were even more dramatic. The mean total 
score after surgery decreased from 78.2 to 39.8. This 
indicates a clinically significant change from a severe 
impact on quality of life preoperatively to a mild impact 
postoperatively.14 These improvements occurred without 
any significant change in BMI. 

Kudoh and Sanai17 studied 25 obese children prospectively 
for a period of 5 to 6 days after adenotonsillectomy 
for OSA. They showed that during this brief 
follow-up period surgery was effective in decreasing 
irregular breathing and oxygen desaturation during 
sleep as measured by pulse oximetry. Marcus et al18 
studied 8 obese children with OSA identified by PSG. 
After adenotonsillectomy, improvement in snoring and 
in breathing difficulties in these children was reported 

by caregivers based on a postoperative questionnaire. 
Postoperative PSG was performed in only 2 of these 
children and this showed resolution of OSA. Soultan et al4 
reported a retrospective study of 17 obese children with 
OSA after adenotonsillectomy. The caregivers of 8 of 
these children reported resolution of the symptoms of 
OSA after surgery. One child continued to have persistent 
snoring and in another child no improvement was reported. 
The remaining children were lost to follow-up. 

The present prospective study included 30 children 
with age-and gender-specific BMI greater than the 95th 
percentile.12 These children had both preoperative and 
postoperative full-night PSG. Caregivers for these children 
completed preoperative and postoperative OSA-18 
quality of life surveys. The mean period of follow-up was 

5.6 months. Preoperatively, 24 children (79%) had moderate 
to severe OSA and 6 children (21%) 
had mild OSA. Postoperatively, 11 children (37%) had 
moderate to severe OSA, 5 children (17%) had mild OSA, 
and 14 children (46%) had no evidence of OSA. 
Caregivers reported improvement in their children 
after surgery in all domains of the OSA-18 survey 
including sleep disturbance, physical suffering, emotional 
distress, and daytime problems. Caregivers’ concerns 
were also reduced after surgery. Goldstein et al10 
and Mitchell et al11 reported similar improvements in 
quality of life after adenotonsillectomy in the general 
population of children with OSA within 6 months of 
surgery. The mean interval between surgery and the 
postoperative OSA-18 survey in the present study was 

2.4 months. Thus we conclude that the dramatic improvement 
in quality of life seen after adenotonsillectomy 
for OSA in the general population of children also 
occurs in obese children. This improvement persists for 
at least 2 months after surgery. 
It has been postulated that decreased activity and 
hypersomnolence, both known to be consequences of 
OSA in children, may lead to obesity (Guilleminault, 
1981). Therefore, it is logical to propose that correcting 
OSA would lead to increased activity and weight loss. 
Surprisingly, Soultan et al4 showed that treatment of 
OSA may be associated with an increase in obesity. 
Kudoh and Sanai17 reported no change in weight after 
adenotonsillectomy for OSA in obese children despite 
the fact that dietary treatment was given before surgery. 


108 MITCHELL and KELLY 

These reports suggest that adenotonsillectomy improves 
OSA but does not lead to weight reduction. The 
children enrolled in the present study also did not show 
a significant change in BMI after surgery. 

The present study, to our knowledge, is the first 
prospective study of improvements in PSG and quality 
of life after adenotonsillectomy in obese children with 
obstructive sleep apnea. However, the present study has 
a number of limitations. The follow-up period for PSG 
was a mean of 5.6 months and for OSA-18 was a mean 
of 2.4 months. Therefore, it is not possible to state that 
improvements in OSA after surgery in obese children 
are maintained long-term. Also, the limited availability 
and the cost of PSG restricted the number of children in 
the study population. This prevented a logistic regression 
analysis of the effects of possible confounders 
such as gender, age, and comorbidities on the outcome 
of surgery. Finally, it was not possible to have a control 
group of obese children with OSA observed over a 
period of several months and treated with nonsurgical 
therapy. As a consequence, we cannot exclude the 
possibility that improvement after surgery was due in 
part to a tendency of the condition to improve with 
time. In spite of these shortcomings, the present study 
shows marked improvements in OSA in obese children 
after adenotonsillectomy. 

CONCLUSION 

Obese children with OSA who undergo adenotonsillectomy 
show a significant improvement in RDI and 
in quality of life over period of several months with no 
change in BMI. However, OSA does not resolve in the 
majority of obese children after surgery.
