ABSTRACT 

Snoring can occur alone or it may be the presenting feature of Obstructive Sleep Apnea 

and other common chronic conditions. In our study, we aimed to estimate the prevalence 

and correlates of snoring in adolescent students in Tehran, Iran. 

A cross-sectional study was designed and students were selected from 20 secondary and 

high schools, in 5 different zones in Tehran in order to have a representative sample of the 

adolescent population. 

A total of 2900 students (1200 male and 1700 female students) 11-17 year-old who were 
attending secondary and high schools were investigated. Information was collected via a 
structured face-to-face interview, based on a questionnaire. In addition to snoring, nocturnal 
cough, asthma-related symptoms, and daytime symptoms were also questioned. BMI was 
measured by two trained physicians. The prevalence of snoring was 7.9% (4.8% in girls and 
12.4% in boys). The prevalence of snoring was significantly higher among males (P< 0.05). 
Snoring was positively associated with asthma and nocturnal cough. Overweight/obese 
adolescents had significantly higher rates of snoring and asthma symptoms. Prevalence of 
daytime symptoms increased significantly in the snoring group. 

These results suggest that snoring is associated with multiple factors in adolescents. We 
conclude that the prevalence of snoring is relatively high in children of this region. This 
highlights the need for awareness among physicians about the problem of sleep-disordered 
breathing, especially in children with asthma and obesity, and also the need for further 
studies to measure the prevalence of sleep breathing disorders among Iranians.

K. Bidad, et al. 
Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) in 
children is a disorder of breathing during sleep 
characterized by prolonged partial upper airway 
obstruction and/or intermittent complete obstruction 
(obstructive apnea) that disrupts normal ventilation 
during sleep. It is associated with symptoms including 
habitual (nightly) snoring, sleep difficulties, and/or 
daytime neurobehavioral problems. Complications may 
include growth abnormalities, neurologic disorders, and 
corpulmonale, especially in severe cases.2 

The prevalence of OSAS ranged from 0.7% to 
10.3%, while the prevalence of snoring ranges from 
3.2% to 12.1%.2 

Snoring, a cardinal symptom of obstructive SDB,3, 4 
is a noise produced during sleep by the partial collapse 
of the oropharynx or hypopharynx. Snoring can occur 
alone or it may be the presenting feature of OSA and 
other common chronic conditions such as allergic 
rhinitis. Some studies have shown that snoring is 
significantly increased in children with asthma.1, 3 In a 
study, snoring was associated with a history of 
exercise-induced asthma. 3 There are biologically 
plausible mechanisms that could explain the association 
between asthma and snoring. Worsening of 
gastroesophageaal reflux induced by snoring may 
trigger asthma. In addition, asthma and SDB may be 
linked because of the common risk factors that promote 
airway inflammation and/or disturbed neuromuscular 
control of breathing. Obesity is a possible risk factor 
for OSA.1 An association between nocturnal cough and 
upper airway obstruction in sleep has also been 
observed in clinical settings.3 SDB has been assumed to 
be a condition associated primarily with males. The 
reason for gender disparity is not fully understood; 
however, it has been suggested that the risk factors and 
mechanisms for the development of SDB, in structure 
and function of the upper airway, may differ between 
males and females. Sex hormones have also been 
thought to influence the development of OSA.5 

Many studies have also indicated that habitual 
snoring is associated with hypertension, 
cerebrovascular disease and daytime sleepiness in 
adults. 6 At the same time, snoring in children has been 
associated with daytime sleepiness and restless sleep.7 

This study was carried out in order to estimate the 
prevalence of snoring in a representative sample of 
adolescents in Tehran for the first time, and to discover 
the relationship between snoring and some possible risk 
factors in the same population. 

PATIENTS AND METHODS 

Procedures 

In a cross-sectional study, 3300 students (1500 
males and 1800 females) aged 11-17 years (350-500 
students from each age group) were assessed in Tehran, 
between September 2004 and June 2005. During a 
multistage stratified cluster sampling, 20 secondary 
schools (6th to 11th grades) were selected from different 
zones in the city to get an equal distribution of children 
by socio-economic status (SES). A questionnaire was 
filled providing information on demographic 
characteristics, sleep-related problems, such as snoring, 
sleep apnea, nocturnal cough, and daytime sleepiness, 
respiratory symptoms, and gastrointestinal problems 
focusing on gastro-esophageal reflux symptoms. 

Information was collected via a structured face-toface 
interview after a full explanation of the purpose of 
the study, and questionnaires providing information on 
the occurrence and frequency of snoring, sleep apnea 
and daytime symptoms (daytime sleepiness in different 
situations) were filled by two trained physicians. 
Participation was on a voluntary basis without teacher 
input. On the same day, body weight and height were 
measured to the nearest 0.1 kg and 0.5 cm and the 
students were evaluated for tonsillar hypertrophy. 

Definition 

Snoring and nocturnal cough were defined as the 
presence of these symptoms for = 3 nights per week 6 
in the absence of a cold. 3 The definition of asthma was 
based on the following questions: 1) Has your 
physician ever told you that you have asthma or 
asthmatic bronchitis? 2) Have you ever had asthmatic 
attacks (attacks characterized by shortness of breath 
with audible wheezing)? 3) When playing, do you 
become breathless more easily than other children? 
Asthmatic children were defined as those who gave an 
affirmative answer to question 1 or questions 2 and 3. 
To record a student as allergic, we questioned students 
for allergy symptoms. Gastroesophageal reflux 
symptoms included heartburn and acid regurgitation. 

The BMI was calculated as weight/height², and 
expressed as kg/m². Using reference growth charts 
from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)/ 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
(2000) 8, overweight and obesity were defined as =85th 
and =95th percentile, of age- and sex-specific 
NCHS/CDC2000 BMI values, respectively. 9, 10

Snoring in adolescents in Tehran 

SPSS 10.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) 
was used for statistical analysis. We have used .2 test to 
analyze qualitative variables. Group means were 
compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) or t-
test. Pearson’s correlation test was used to calculate the 
correlation between the variables studied. All statistical 
inferences were made at a = 0.05. 

The study was approved by the ethic board of 
Tehran University of Medical Sciences and Iranian 
Ministry of Education and Training. 

RESULTS 

Three thousand five hundred 11- to 17-year-old 
adolescent students from five districts in Tehran, 
distributed so as to represent all socioeconomic classes, 
were evaluated. Of the selected subjects from 20 
schools, 3300 consented to participate in the survey 
(responded to questions). Four hundred questionnaires 
were discarded because of incomplete information 
(students not knowing the answers exactly) and 
incorrect information (unrealistic responses and 
humorous remarks). 

In the 1200 boys and 1700 girls studied (the mean 
age of students was 15 in boys and 14 in girls), 146 
boys (12.4%) and 82 girls (4.8%) had snoring for = 3 
nights per week, and 47 boys (4.0%) and 34 girls 
(2.0%) were reported to have nocturnal cough for = 3 

nights per week. In addition, 103 boys (8.7%) and 98 
girls (5.8%) were defined as having asthma. The 
overall prevalence of snoring, nocturnal cough, and 
asthma were 7.9 %, 2.8%, and 7.0%, respectively. 
Prevalence and correlates of snoring are shown in 
Table 1. 

The prevalence of snoring was significantly higher 
in males (P=0.00), and there was no trend for 
association with age (P=0.09) 

Night cough (P=0.00) and asthma (P=0.02) were 
significantly more frequent in snorers compared to the 
non-snoring group. Exercise-induced asthma was also 
reported significantly more in the snoring group, while 
there was no such association between snoring and the 
history of allergies. Sleep apnea was only reported in 
12 students (0.4 %) and there was no significant 
relationship between sleep apnea and snoring. On the 
other hand, sleep apnea was reported significantly more 
in overweight and obese students. 

In male adolescents, the mean BMI was 22.17 
kg/m² and in female students it was 20.61 kg/m². Mean 
BMI was significantly higher in male students and 
snoring was significantly more frequent in students 
with higher BMIs (P=0.00). There was a >2 fold risk of 
snoring in subjects with overweight or obesity. The 
prevalence of snoring in different BMI groups and also 
different age groups are summarized in Table 2.

DISCUSSION 

The results of our study showed that the prevalence 
of snoring is 7.9% in 11-17 year-old students in 
Tehran. There has not been any data on the prevalence 
of snoring in Iran, thus, this is the first study with such 
a large representative sample of the general population. 
Previous studies from various countries have shown 
that the prevalence of habitual snoring ranged from 3.2 
to 12.1% in children2,6 and from 5 to 40% in adults, 
depending on the definition of habitual snoring. In a 
sample of early adolescents, the prevalence of habitual 
snoring was reported to be 5.6%. It has also been 
demonstrated that the prevalence of habitual snoring 
ranges from 2.2% to 4.6% in girls and from 5.8% to 
8.8% in boys among those aged 15 to 20 years, 
depending on BMI. 6 In a study by Shin et al, the 

130/ IRANIAN JOURNAL OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA AND IMMUNOLOGY 

prevalence of habitual snoring (defined as snoring = 3 
days per week) was estimated to be 11.2% among 11th 
grade high school students 6 and in a study by Lu et al, 
prevalence of snoring (defined as snoring = 4 nights per 
week) was estimated to be 10.5% in preschool 
children.3 However in the study conducted in Istanbul, 
Turkey, the prevalence of snoring in 5 to 13-year-old 
children was reported to be 7.0%, similar to the study 
of Ferreira et al 4, 11, which are both in agreement with 
our study. The differences in prevalence rate, therefore, 
may be largely attributed to the definitions of habitual 
snoring that were used and the different age groups 
which were studied. 

In our study, similar to the study of Lu et al,3 
nocturnal cough, and asthma highly correlated with 
habitual snoring and it is stated that the high prevalence 
of nocturnal cough in children who snore cannot be 
explained by the coexistence of asthma and nocturnal 
cough, but is explained by both factors acting 
independently. 

Furthermore, in the study of Redline et al,12 
children with SDB were significantly more reported to 
have had: usual cough, occasional wheeze, persistent 
wheeze, and doctor-diagnosed asthma. While Ersu et 
al.11 reported higher atopy and asthma prevalence in 
children with habitual snoring, we found no such 
association between allergy and snoring, and this could 
be due to subjective reports rather than objective 
measures for allergy and atopy. 

In our study, snoring was more prevalent in boys, 
which is in agreement with previous studies in children 
and adolescents3,5,11-14 and even adults.13,15 The gender 
difference in adolescents and adults is attributed to sex 
hormones and their influence on respiratory control 
and/or body fat distribution. These factors would play a 
smaller role in prepubertal children. However, in our 
study, since boys aged more than 12 years, they had a 
higher prevalence of snoring, thus the role of puberty is 
highlighted.11,12 

Regarding the daytime symptoms, Ersu et al11 
reported habitual snorers to have had symptoms such as 
falling asleep while watching television and in public 
places in both genders. Shin et al6 showed that habitual 
snoring correlated with increasing degrees of daytime 
sleepiness, while in our study, we found such relation 
only with males. This may be explained by the higher 
prevalence of snoring in males. 

The strong association between BMI and snoring in 
the current report in adolescents also has been noted in 

 Vol. 5, No. 3, September 2006 


Snoring in adolescents in Tehran 

previous studies. 5, 12 Bloom et al suggested that this 
may be related to a reduction in pharyngeal airway 
diameter produced by deposits of adipose tissue in 
obese individuals. Pharyngeal resistance correlates with 
increasing weight/height ratio or obesity. 

We found that tonsillar hypertrophy is significantly 
more frequent in students who snore, and this 
association could be explained with frequent tonsillitis, 
and this finding is in agreement with previous 
studies.11,12 

This cross-sectional study has some limitations. 
First of all, self-reported information is of concern and 
subjective responses are prone to errors and over- and 
under-reporting. Second, the presence of snoring was 
established on self-reported questions rather than 
objective tests and it is a less-than-optimal method for 
accurately to identify people with snoring. 
Furthermore, the cross-sectional design of the study 
introduces uncertainties regarding the sequence of 
cause and effect of the observed associations. On the 
other hand, the importance of this study is that it is the 
first one to report on the prevalence of snoring and 
associated factors in a sample of adolescents in Iran. 
The large sample size and the limited number of 
observers, who were physicians as well, are the 
strengths of the study. 

We conclude that the prevalence of snoring, 
suggestive of obstructive sleep problems,17 is relatively 
high in adolescents of this region. Although presence of 
these symptoms do not necessarily indicate presence of 
OSA, these findings highlight the need for awareness 
among the community and physicians about the 
problem of obstructive SDB, especially in children with 
asthma and/or overweight or obesity, and the need for 
further studies to measure the prevalence of sleep 
breathing disorders. 1 

Given the relatively high prevalence of snoring in 
adolescents, any causal association would likely have a 
large public health impact, necessitating more 
aggressive screening, diagnosis, and treatment 
strategies aimed at identifying and treating a potentially 
treatable disorder.
