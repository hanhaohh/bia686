Abstract 


Background 
and 
purpose: To assess the presence of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) in a population of obese children and adolescents and 
to investigate the role of fat distribution in predicting SDB. 
Patients 
and 
methods: One hundred and thirty-two obese children and adolescents, aged 5.0–14.2 years, were consecutively referred to the 
Department of Pediatrics of the Second University of Naples for screening of obesity. The control group consisted of 453, sex-and age-
matched lean subjects selected from local schools in Campania region. The sleep disturbances scale for children (SDSC) questionnaire was 
used to evaluate SDB prevalence. In all subjects, waist circumference, triceps and sub-scapular skin folds were measured, and Z-scores were 
calculated. 
Results: Obese subjects showed significantly higher SDB and sleep hyperhydrosis (SHY) scores than controls. The Z-score of waist 
circumference correlated with SDB (rZ0.32; PZ0.006) and SHY factor scores (rZ0.37; PZ0.005), while the Z-score of body mass index 
(BMI), triceps and sub-scapular skin folds were not correlated with any SDSC factor scores. Subjects in the higher tertile for Z-score of waist 
circumference had a significantly higher risk for developing SDB (OR 1.9; 95% IC 1.8–3.2) and SHY (OR 2.1; 95% IC 2.0–4.5). 
Conclusions: Waist circumference is a more reliable index than total adiposity and subcutaneous fat in predicting the risk of obese children to 
develop SDB.

Introduction 
Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) consists of frequent 
and repetitive episodes of pharyngeal obstruction during 
sleep, often with consequent desaturation in arterial oxygen 
quote, sleep fragmentation and daytime sleepiness in adults. 

In children, the most commonly documented cause of 
SDB is upper airway obstruction, which can be classified 
into three grades of severity: primary snoring with a 
prevalence ranging from 3.2 to 10% [1,2], upper airway 
resistance syndrome (UARS) with highly variable

prevalence ranging from 6 to 63% and obstructive sleep 
apnea syndrome (OSAS) with a prevalence of about 1–3% 
[3,4]. 

Similar to adults, obesity may predispose children to 
OSA [5,6] Obese children with SDB might experience an 
increase in the size of the soft tissue structures surrounding 
the upper airways, size of their tongue, soft palate, and 
lateral pharyngeal walls [7,8]. 

Marcus et al. [6] reported that obese children are at risk 
for OSAS, and that the degree of OSAS is proportional to 
the degree of obesity. Further, Gozal et al. [9] found that the 
severity of the apnea index positively correlated with body 
mass index (BMI) and with tendency to develop excessive 
daytime somnolence. In the converse, a population-based 
study failed to confirm that children categorized as obese are 
more likely to have a higher respiratory disturbance index 
(RDI) [10].

Different studies in adults and children reported that 
sleep apnea is more closely related to visceral fat than BMI 
[11,13] and, additionally, the severity of OSA in children 
seems to be independent of degree of obesity expressed as 
BMI [13]. 

Since few studies focused on SDB in Italian children 
[4,14,15] and did not attempt to relate SDB to obesity, in the 
present study we aimed (a) to verify the presence of SDB in 
a school-aged population of Italian obese children and 
adolescents and (b) to investigate whether the fat 
distribution, measured as waist circumference and triceps 
and sub-scapular skin folds, may predict the SDB. 

2. 
Methods 
2.1. 
Subjects 
One-hundred and thirty-two children (67 males, 65 
females), aged 5.0–14.2 years, (mean: 8. 7G2.0 years) 
were referred from primary care physicians to the 
Department of Pediatrics of the Second University of 
Naples for screening of obesity. All subjects agreed to 
participate in the study. Informed consent was obtained 
from parents and children. The ethical committee approved 
the study design. The BMI (weight/height2) of all obese 
subjects was O95th percentile for age and sex reference 
values [16]. 

Ninety (68.2%) obese children were prepubertal 
(Tanner stage 1) while the others were pubertal: 15 
(11.4%) Tanner stage 2, 17 (12.9%) Tanner stage 3 and 
10 (7.5%) Tanner stage 4 [17]. 

Children were excluded from the study if they had known 
clinical conditions such as genetic diseases (Down 
syndrome or Prader–Willi syndrome), craniofacial abnormalities, 
or neuromuscular diseases. None of the recruited 
children presented inter-current respiratory tract infections. 
Another criterium for exclusion was the use of anticonvulsant 
or psychoactive drugs. 

The control group consisted of 453 normal-weight (BMI 
!85th percentile), sex-(240 males, 213 females) and age-
matched controls (mean age: 8.9G1.8 years) randomly 
selected from local schools in Campania region, between 
January 2004 and July 2004. Among controls, 97 children 
were excluded from the original population (nZ550) 
because they were overweight (percentile BMI O85th). 
The Tanner stage distribution was similar to the obese 
group: 317 controls (69.9%) were prepubertal (Tanner stage 
1), 52 (11.6%) were in Tanner stage 2, 54 (11.9%) in Tanner 
stage 3 and 30 (6.6%) in Tanner stage 4). 

2.2. 
Procedure 
The University Ethics Committee approved the study, 
and parents gave written informed consent during the first 
screening visit. Both obese children and controls were 

evaluated in the Endocrinology Unit of the Department of 
Pediatrics of the University of Naples to undergo the body 
measurements needed for the study. 

All subjects’ mothers filled out the sleep disturbances 
scale for children (SDSC) [18]. The SDSC is a sleep 
questionnaire that consists of 26 items subdivided into six 
sleep disorders subscales: disorders in initiating and 
maintaining sleep (DIMS), sleep breathing disorders 
(SBD), disorders of arousal (DA), sleep-wake transition 
disorders (SWTD), disorders of excessive somnolence 
(DES), sleep hyperhydrosis (SHY). 

In all subjects, waist circumference was measured by 
trained technicians using a tape measure at just above the 
uppermost lateral border of the right ilium, at the end of a 
normal expiration, and was recorded at the nearest 
millimeter. Z-scores were calculated according to Zannolli 
and Morgese [19]. Triceps and sub-scapular skin folds (TSF 
and SSF), used as marker of subcutaneous fat, were 
measured as previously described [20]. Briefly, the measure 
was taken by the same operator using an Holtain–Tanner 
caliper (Harpenden and Holtain, Anthropometric Instruments, 
UK) on the non-dominant side. Measurements were 
repeated in duplicate. Z-scores were calculated according to 
Frisancho [21]. 

2.3. 
Statistical 
analysis 
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was generated to 
evaluate differences in clinical and anthropometric 
measures and in the six SDSC factor scores between 
obese and non-obese children. A Pearson’s correlation 
was used to correlate the six SDSC factor scores in the 
obese population with Z-score BMI, Z-score of waist 
circumference, Z-score of triceps and sub-scapular skin 
folds (divided into tertiles). A logistic regression analysis 
was performed in order to assess the risk of developing 
sleep disturbances by being in a higher tertile for the 
Z-score BMI, waist, sub-scapular or triceps skin folds. The 
factor scores that were significantly higher in obese 
children were converted into a discrete variable and 
entered in the logistic regression. 

The P 
level was set at !0.05 for statistical significance. 
All data were coded and analyzed using the commercially 
available STATISTICA 6.0 package for Windows (StatSoft, 
Inc., Tulsa, OK). 

3. 
Results 
Table 1 shows the anthropometric and clinical characteristics 
of the two groups studied. The mean age of obese 
and non-obese children was comparable, while the Z-score 
BMI was obviously significantly higher in obese children. 
The waist mean Z-score in obese children was 1.9G0.9, 
higher than that of the non-obese group. The Z-scores for

triceps and sub-scapular skin folds were also higher in obese 
vs. non-obese children. 

The ANOVA showed significantly higher values of the 
SDB and SHY factor scores in obese children (Table 2). The 
DIMS and DES factor scores were slightly but significantly 
higher in the non-obese group while no differences were 
observed for SWTD and DA scores. 

The logistic regression showed that obese subjects had a 
higher risk to develop SDB and SHY when compared to 
controls (Table 3). 

In the obese group, the Z-score of waist circumference 
correlated with SDB (rZ0.32; PZ0.006) and SHY factor 
scores (rZ0.37; PZ0.005), while the Z-score of BMI, 
triceps and sub-scapular skin folds were not associated with 
any SDSC factor scores (Table 4). 

When categorized according to three categories of 
Z-score BMI, Z-score waist, Z-score TSF and Z-score 
SSS, the prevalence of SDB and SHY increased significantly 
with increasing Z-score waist (X2Z7.63, PZ0.02 for 
SDB; 7.9, PZ0.01 for SHY). As shown in Fig. 1, the 
regression analysis disclosed that the obese subjects in the 
higher tertile for Z-score waist were at a significantly higher 
risk for developing SDB (ORZ1.9; 95% CIZ1.8–3.2) and 
SHY (ORZ2.1; 95% CIZ2.0–4.5), while no differences 
were observed among Z-score BMI, triceps and sub-
scapular skinfolds tertiles.

Discussion 
In clinical practice, the assessment of obesity is 
performed by means of anthropomorphic measurements 
and various body diameters and circumferences. These 
measures are strongly related to the degree of SDB, and 
different studies have shown that obese children are at risk 
for OSAS, proportionate to the degree of their obesity; the 
association between snoring and BMIO95th percentile is 
relevant [22–25]. 

However, it is known that most children with OSAS are 
not obese, and probably other factors, such as fat 
distribution, play a role in increasing their risk for 
developing SDB. We should also consider that the vast 
majority of cases of OSAS in children are associated with 
adenotonsillar hypertrophy and that OSAS is not simply 
caused by large tonsils and adenoids; different studies have 
shown only a weak relationship between the severity of 
OSAS and the size of these tissues when assessed clinically 
or by simple radiographic methods [26–28]. The use of 
three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
techniques showed that the three-dimensional orientation 
of these tissues, and how they overlap in the airway, is a 
more important factor which can significantly affect flow 
resistance during sleep [29,30].

Fig. 1. Effect of waist circumference, BMI, triceps and sub-scapular skin 
folds on the occurrence of the SDB and SHY. Subjects were grouped into 
three categories of BMI, triceps skin folds, sub-scapular skin folds and 
waist circumference standard-deviation scores (Z scores) with cut-offs at 
the 33th and 66th percentiles. Being in a higher tertile for Z-score waist 
doubled the risk factor for developing SDB and SHY. 

Childhood OSAS is a dynamic process resulting from a 
combination of structural and neuro-motor anomalies 
rather than from structural abnormalities alone or fat 
distribution [31]. 

Our study supports the importance of fat distribution in 
predicting the occurrence of SDB and SHY in children; in 
fact, we found that SDB and SHY scores of obese children 
are significantly higher than those obtained from non-obese 
controls and that they relate to waist circumference, 
expressed as Z-score. Further, obese subjects in the higher 
tertile for waist Z-score have a significantly higher risk for 
developing SDB and SHY. BMI, on the contrary, as well as 
triceps and sub-scapular skin folds, are not reliable 
measures in predicting the occurrence of SDB and SHY, 
at least among obese children. 

In adults, the visceral fat and the body fat composition 
are considered crucial factors for health morbidities, rather 
than the total adiposity, which is associated with a high risk 
of vascular disorders (cerebral, cardiac, hypertension) and 
metabolic diseases (type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia) [12]. 
Indeed, several morbidities are more closely related to waist 
circumference than BMI, and lower-body obese individuals 
have an increased risk of numerous illnesses in comparison 
to upper-body obese individuals [12,32–35]. 

It has been reported that the severity of OSA in obese 
children is correlated with fasting insulin levels and with 
increased plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Both 
insulin and CRP levels were also reported to be related to 

waist circumference [36–38]. The correlation between OSA 
and waist circumference could therefore be mediated by 
insulin and CRP levels, but visceral fat accumulation per se 
might affect breathing during sleep because of mechanical 
compression on the diaphragm caused by the effects of 
increased mass on the chest wall and abdomen [39]. 

The correlation between waist circumference and SHY 
score may be mediated by the SDB. It is known that night 
sweating is a common symptom of obstructive sleep apnea. 
The pathogenetic mechanism is still unclear. Sweating 
might be (a) the consequence of the increased respiratory 
effort linked to mechanical impairment, (b) the result of the 
stimulation of a-receptors and b-receptors, or (c) the 
indirect effect of sympathetic activation of other vasopressor 
systems such as the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone 
system or both [40–42]. 

In contrast with the expectations, the DIMS and DES 
scores were slightly higher in the non-obese group. We 
suggest that the sleep fragmentation related to SDB can lead 
to daytime somnolence and hyperactivity and inattention 
problems, and this ‘subtle chronic sleep fragmentation due 
to SDB’ could lead to a sleep debt that reinforces 
homeostatic processes and increases the sleep pressure 
leading to a reduction of DIMS in these subjects [43–46]. 

We should take into account some limitations of this 
study: our data were derived from parental questionnaires 
and not from polysomnographic data and, therefore, its 
accuracy in evaluating sleep disturbances is limited. We did 
not evaluate the level of physical activity, and we did not 
obtain specific information on dietary habits that might be 
potential confounders. Moreover, we did not determine 
insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and CRP levels that were 
reported to be correlated with the degree of body adiposity. 

Notwithstanding these limitations, our study shows that 
among obese children and adolescents, visceral fat 
(expressed as waist circumference) is a more reliable 
index in predicting the risk for developing sleep breathing 
disorders than total adiposity (expressed as BMI) and 
subcutaneous fat (expressed as sub-scapular and triceps skin 
folds).
