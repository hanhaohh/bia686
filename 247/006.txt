ABSTRACT 
Objectives. 
Nocturnal 
enuresis 
has 
been 
associated 
with 
obstructive 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
mostly 
in 
hospital-referred 
adults 
and 
children. 
To 
investigate 
whether 
primary 
nocturnal 
enuresis 
is 
significantly 
associated 
with 
habitual 
snoring 
in 
the 
general 
pediatric 
population 
irrespective 
of 
subjects’ 
age 
and 
sex, 
we 
studied 
children 
attending 
six 
randomly 
selected 
schools 
in 
a 
city 
in 
central 
Greece. 
Methods. 
A 
questionnaire 
regarding 
the 
symptoms 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
and 
the 
presence 
of 
nocturnal 
enuresis 
(bedwetting 
for 
at 
least 
one 
night 
per 
week) 
was 
answered 
by 
the 
children’s 
parents. 
Results. 
A 
total 
of 
1821 
children 
(age 
5 
to 
14 
years; 
896 
girls) 
were 
included 
in 
the 
study. 
Of 
these, 
135 
(7.4%) 
were 
snoring 
more 
frequently 
than 
three 
nights 
per 
week 
(habitual 
snorers). 
The 
habitual 
snorers 
had 
a 
history 
of 
primary 
nocturnal 
enuresis 
more 
often 
than 
did 
nonhabitual 
snorers 
(7.4% 
versus 
2%; 
odds 
ratio 
4.00, 
95% 
confidence 
interval 
1.93 
to 
8.32). 
The 
association 
of 
primary 
nocturnal 
enuresis 
with 
habitual 
snoring 
remained 
significant 
after 
adjustment 
for 
age 
and 
sex 
(odds 
ratio 
3.54, 
95% 
confidence 
interval 
1.68 
to 
7.44). 
Conclusions. 
In 
a 
community 
sample 
of 
children, 
those 
with 
habitual 
snoring 
more 
often 
had 
primary 
nocturnal 
enuresis 
than 
did 
those 
without 
snoring.

The 
association 
between 
the 
two 
conditions 
in 
pediatric 
subjects 
is 
supported 
by 
the 
decrease

Habitual 
snoring 
is 
the 
most 
common 
clinical 
manifestation 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing, 
an 
abnormality 
that 
ranges 
in 
severity 
from 
upper 
airway

syndrome 
to 
primary 
snoring 
to 
obstructive 
sleep 
apneahypopnea. 


The 
aim 
of 
the 
present 
study 
was 
to 
assess 
the 
association 
between 
primary 
nocturnal 
enuresis 
and 
habitual 
snoring 
in 
children 
and 
the 
effect 
of 
age

on 
this

The 
University 
of 
Thessaly 
Ethics 
Committee 
and 
the 
local 
Elementary 
and 
Secondary 
Education 
Authorities 
approved 
the 
study 
protocol 
and 
questionnaire. 
The 
questionnaire 
was 
prepared 
by 
modifying 
tools 
used 
in 
previous 
studies10–12 
and 
included 
questions 
regarding 
symptoms 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
that 
were 
present 
for 
at 
least 
6 
months; 
and 
questions 
about 
enuresis 
during 
the 
preceding 
12 
months. 
The 
frequency 
of 
bedwetting 
was 
graded 
as 
every 
night; 
at 
least 
one 
night 
per 
week 
but 
not 
every 
night; 
at 
least

study. 
The 
schools 
were 
randomly 
selected 
among 
those 
located 
in 
the 
Larissa 
School 
District 
(Larissa, 
Greece), 
and 
all 
students 
were 
eligible 
for 
participation 
in 
the 
study. 
The 
questionnaire 
form 
and 
a 
letter 
providing 
instructions 
for 
completion 
of 
the 
form 
were 
sent 
to 
the 
parents. 
The 
data 
from 
children 
whose 
parents 
returned 
a 
fully 
completed 
questionnaire 
were 
used 
for 
additional 
analysis. 
Children 
were 
excluded 
from 
the 
analysis 
if 
they 
had 
a 
history 
of 
spina 
bifida, 
cerebral 
palsy 
chromosomal 
abnormalities, 
diabetes 
mellitus, 
or 
diabetes 
insipidus. 


STATISTICAL 
ANALYSIS 


Primary 
nocturnal 
enuresis 
was 
the 
main 
outcome 
variable, 
and 
habitual 
snoring 
was 
the 
independent 
variable 
of 
interest. 
Children 
with 
snoring 
for 
more 
than 
3 
nights 
per 
week 
within 
the 
previous 
6 
months 
were 
defined 
as 
habitual 
snorers. 
Enuresis 
was 
a 
history 
of 
urine 
incontinence 
for 
at 
least 
one 
night 
per 
week 
in 
children 
older 
than 
4 
years 
of 
age.12,13 
Enuresis 
was 
defined 
as 
primary 
if 
the 
child 
had 
never 
been 
dry 
for 
a 
period 
of 
at 
least 
6 
months.14 


The 
comparison 
of 
habitual 
snorers 
with 
nonhabitual 
snorers 
for 
continuous 
variables 
was 
completed 
using 
Student’s 
t 
test 
and 
for 
categorical 
characteristics 
using 
the 
chi-square 
test 
(Yates’ 
correction). 
The 
odds 
ratios 
and 
corresponding 
95% 
confidence 
intervals 
for 
primary 
nocturnal 
enuresis 
in 
children 
with 
versus 
without 
habitual 
snoring 
were 
calculated 
using 
univariate 
logistic 
regression 
analysis. 
Multiple 
logistic 
regression 
analysis 
was 
then 
done 
to 
adjust 
the 
odds 
ratio 
for 
age 
and 
sex 
(Statistical 
Package 
for 
Social 
Sciences, 
version 
10.0, 
SPSS, 
Chicago, 
Ill). 
The 
adjustment 
for 
age 
and 
sex 
was 
done, 
because 
it 
is 
known 
that 
these 
variables 
affect 
the 
probability 
of 
nocturnal 
enuresis.11–13,15,16 


RESULTS 


A 
total 
of 
2102 
questionnaires 
were 
distributed 
and 
1825 
(86.8%) 
were 
returned 
appropriately 
completed. 
Of 
the 
1825 
children, 
4 
were 
excluded 
(spina 
bifida 
in 
1 
and 
diabetes 
mellitus 
in 
3). 
Thus, 
the 
data 
from 
1821 
children 
(49.2% 
female) 
were 
used 
for 
statistical 
analysis. 
The 
age 
range 
of 
the 
studied 
population 
sample 
was 
5 
to 
14 
years 
(mean 
age 
. 
SD 
9.3 
. 
2). 
Of 
the 
1821 
children, 
135 
(7.4%) 
were 
habitual 
snorers 
(snoring 
for 
more 
than 
3 
nights 
per 
week). 
The 
distribution 
of 
characteristics 
and 
symptoms 
related 
to 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
in 
the 
habitual 
snorers 
and 
nonhabitual 
snorers 
are 
presented 
in 
Table 
I. 


Of 
the 
1821 
children, 
43 
(2.4%) 
had 
a 
history 
of 
primary 
nocturnal 
enuresis. 
The 
prevalence 
of 
enuresis 
was 
7.4% 
(10 
of 
135) 
for 
the 
habitual 
snorers 
versus 
2% 
(33 
of 
1686) 
for 
the 
nonhabitual 
snorers 
(odds 
ratio 
4.00, 
95% 
confidence 
interval 
1.93 
to 
8.32, 
P 
.

Habitual 
snorers 
had 
a 
four 
times 
greater 
probability 
of 
enuresis 
than 
did 
nonhabitual 
snorers. 


When 
the 
odds 
ratio 
for 
enuresis 
was 
adjusted 
by 
age 
and 
sex, 
the 
association 
between 
primary 
nocturnal 
enuresis 
and 
habitual 
snoring 
remained 
significant

COMMENT 


Snoring 
is 
the 
most 
common 
clinical 
manifestation 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing.17 
In 
the 
present 
investigation, 
a 
significant 
association 
between 
primary 
nocturnal 
enuresis 
and 
habitual 
snoring 
in 
childhood 
has 
been 
identified. 
To 
our 
knowledge, 
this 
is 
the 
first 
population-based 
study 
assessing 
the 
possible 
correlation 
between 
the 
two 
variables 
and 
the 
effect 
of 
age 
and 
sex 
on 
this 
correlation. 
The 
frequency 
of 
habitual 
snoring 
was 
7.4%, 
near 
the 
lower 
end 
of 
the 
3.2% 
to 
34.5% 
range 
reported 
in 
pediatric 
studies.18–22 


Nocturnal 
enuresis 
refers 
to 
the 
involuntary 
loss 
of 
urine 
after 
the 
age 
of 
4 
to 
5 
years, 
when 
children 
are 
expected 
to 
have 
achieved 
full 
bladder 
control 
at 
night.12 
It 
is 
classified 
as 
primary 
when 
the 
child 
has 
never 
achieved 
nighttime 
dryness 
and 
secondary 
when 
bedwetting 
occurs 
after 
dryness 
for 
at 
least 
6 
months.14 
The 
minimal 
frequency 
of 
nocturnal 
urine 
loss 
required 
to 
diagnose 
the 
condition 
has 
varied 
in 
different 
studies 
from 
once 
in 
the 
previous 
year12 
to 
twice 
a 
week.13 
A 
more 
stringent 
definition 
of 
enuresis 
was 
used 
in 
the 
present 
study—bedwetting 
for 
at 
least 
one 
night 
per 
week 
was 
required 
to 
characterize 
a 
child 
as 
enuretic. 
The 
prevalence 
of 
enuresis 
(at 
least 
one 
night 
per 
week) 
has 
been 
reported 
to 
be 
1.6% 
to 
13.7%, 
depending 
on 
the 
subject’s 
age 
and 
ethnic 
and 
cultural 
characteristics.11,13,14 
In 
this 
study, 
a 
2.4% 
prevalence 
of 
enuresis 
was 
found 
in 
children 
aged 
5 
to 
14 
years, 
consistent 
with 
the 
results 
of 
other 
reports. 


In 
addition 
to 
habitual 
snoring, 
male 
sex 
and 
age 
of 
9 
years 
or 
younger 
were 
significantly 
associated 
with 
the 
presence 
of 
primary 
nocturnal 
enuresis.

the

was

than 
in

greater 
in 
populations 
with 
low 
socioeconomic 
status,16 
and 
declined 
with 
increasing 
age.11–13,15,16 
The 
population 
of 
the 
city 
of 
Larissa 
consists 
of 
middle-class 
families 
and, 
thus, 
is 
quite 
homogeneous 
regarding 
socioeconomic 
status. 
For 
this 
reason, 
socioeconomic 
status 
was 
not 
included 
in 
the 
multivariate 
analysis. 


An 
increased 
frequency 
of 
primary 
nocturnal 
enuresis 
in 
children 
with 
obstructive 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
has 
previously 
been 
described 
in 
hospital-
referred 
subjects.3,4,6,7 
Furthermore, 
some 
studies 
on 
the 
epidemiology 
and 
symptoms 
of 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
have 
reported 
an 
increased 
frequency 
of 
“current 
enuresis” 
in 
children 
with 
habitual 
snoring,8,9 
although 
this 
has 
not 
been 
a 
consistent 
finding.20,23 
Wang 
and 
colleagues7 
reported 
that 
46% 
of 
children 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
diagnosed 
by 
polysomnography 
had 
nocturnal 
enuresis. 
In 
the 
Tucson 
Children’s 
Assessment 
of 
Sleep 
Apnea 
study,9 
children 
with 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
(respiratory 
disturbance 
index 
greater 
than 
one 
episode 
per 
hour) 
were 
more 
likely 
to 
have 
enuresis 
than 
were 
children 
without 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
(11.3% 
versus 
6.3%). 
However, 
no 
population-based 
studies 
have 
assessed 
the 
association 
between 
primary 
nocturnal 
enuresis 
and 
snoring 
while 
considering 
the 
effect 
of 
the 
subjects’ 
age 
and 
sex. 


The 
existence 
of 
a 
significant 
correlation 
between 
enuresis 
and 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
has 
been 
further 
supported 
by 
the 
decrease 
or 
complete 
resolution 
of 
bedwetting 
after 
successful 
treatment 
of 
the 
respiration 
disorder 
during 
sleep. 
In 
the 
study 
by 
Weider 
and 
colleagues,4 
primary 
nocturnal 
enuresis 
resolved 
or 
decreased 
in 
frequency 
after 
successful 
relief 
of 
upper 
airway 
obstruction 
by 
adenotonsillectomy. 
Similar 
results 
were 
reported 
by 
Cinar 
and 
colleagues24 
for 
children 
who 
underwent 
surgical 
resection 
of 
hypertrophic 
tonsils 
and 
adenoids. 
The 
resolution 
of 
en


uresis 
was 
also 
noted 
in 
children 
with 
habitual 
snoring 
and 
nasal 
obstruction 
who 
received 
treatment 
with 
intranasal 
corticosteroids.5 
Finally, 
effective 
treatment 
of 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea-hypopnea 
in 
adults 
by 
continuous 
positive 
airway 
pressure 
has 
improved 
enuresis.1,2 
The 
findings 
of 
the 
present 
study 
have 
indicated 
that 
only 
23.3% 
of 
children 
with 
nocturnal 
enuresis 
were 
habitual 
snorers. 
This 
suggests 
that 
snoring 
is 
one 
contributing 
factor 
to 
enuresis, 
rather 
than 
a 
common 
underlying 
cause 
that 
should 
be 
aggressively 
sought. 


Several 
different 
pathophysiologic 
mechanisms 
have 
been 
proposed 
to 
explain 
the 
association 
between 
the 
two 
conditions. 
In 
those 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea, 
the 
plasma 
concentration 
of 
brain 
natriuretic 
peptide 
increases 
during 
sleep.25 
Also, 
a 
significant 
negative 
correlation 
has 
been 
found 
between 
the 
plasma 
levels 
of 
atrial 
natriuretic 
peptide 
and 
antidiuretic 
hormone 
in 
patients 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea.26 
The 
release 
of 
atrial 
natriuretic 
peptide 
decreases 
with 
continuous 
positive 
airway 
pressure 
treatment.27 
Thus, 
adults 
with 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea 
probably 
have 
increased 
urine 
production 
and 
are 
potentially 
incontinent 
at 
night 
secondary 
to 
excessive 
release 
of 
cardiac 
natriuretic 
peptides.25,28 
An 
increase 
in 
intra-abdominal 
pressure 
caused 
by 
intense 
respiratory 
efforts 
against 
a 
closed 
upper 
airway 
may 
also 
play 
an 
important 
role 
in 
the 
pathogenesis 
of 
enuresis.29,30 


A 
possible 
limitation 
of 
our 
study 
was 
that 
the 
children 
were 
not 
evaluated 
by 
polysomnography. 
Although 
snoring 
is 
the 
most 
frequent 
symptom 
of 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea-hypopnea, 
its 
absence 
does 
not 
always 
exclude 
the 
possibility 
of 
sleep-
disordered 
breathing.17 
The 
questionnaire 
used 
in 
our 
study 
was 
a 
modification 
of 
tools 
used 
in 
previous 
studies 
on 
sleep-disordered 
breathing 
and 
enuresis10–12; 
however, 
we 
acknowledge 
that 
the 
modified 
instrument 
has 
not 
been 
validated. 
Finally, 
no 
questions 
regarding 
daytime 
urinary 
frequency 
were 
asked; 
thus, 
the 
prevalence 
of 
bladder 
instability 
in 
the 
study 
population 
was 
unknown.

Many 
children 
with 
nighttime 
bedwetting 
have 
bladder 
instability, 
which 
they 
can 
control 
when 
they 
are 
awake, 
but 
not 
while 
asleep. 
These 
subjects 
do 
not 
have 
primary 
enuresis. 
Had 
these 
patients 
been 
excluded, 
the 
association 
between 
snoring 
and 
primary 
nocturnal 
enuresis 
might 
have 
been 
stronger. 


CONCLUSIONS 


Habitually 
snoring 
children 
were 
at 
a 
significantly 
greater 
risk 
of 
having 
primary 
nocturnal 
enuresis 
than 
were 
children 
without 
snoring, 
and 
this 
association 
remained 
significant 
after 
adjustment 
by 
age 
and 
sex. 
Pediatric 
pulmonologists 
who 
evaluate 
children 
with 
habitual 
snoring 
should 
ask 
parents 
about 
a 
history 
of 
bedwetting, 
and 
general 
pediatricians 
who 
treat 
children 
with 
enuresis 
should 
entertain 
the 
possibility 
of 
obstructive 
sleep 
apneahypopnea.
