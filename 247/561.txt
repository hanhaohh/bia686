Study Objectives: It is well established that medical conditions such as 
obesity and cardiovascular disease are associated with increased levels 
of inflammatory biomarkers such as C-reactive protein (CRP). Prior studies 
have produced inconsistent results regarding the association between 
sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and CRP, possibly due to the confounding 
effects of obesity or medical comorbidity. The present study examined 
the association between degree of SDB and level of CRP independent of 
prevalent medical conditions and obesity. 
Design: Cross-sectional study. 
Subjects and Setting: University-based clinical sample referred for diagnostic 
polysomnography. 
Measurements and Results: The study sample consisted of 69 men 
(mean age 40 years; mean BMI of 31.2 kg/m2) free of prevalent medical 
conditions including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular 
disease. Measurements of morning and evening CRP levels were performed 
along with full-montage polysomnography. Confounding due to 
obesity was assessed by adjustments for body mass index, waist circumference, 
and percent body fat. A strong association was found between 

INTRODUCTION 

SLEEP DISORDERED BREATHING (SDB) IS A CHRONIC 
CONDITION CHARACTERIZED BY REPETITIVE COLLAPSE 
OF THE UPPER AIRWAY DURING SLEEP. The resulting 
decrease or cessation of airflow often leads to periods of 
intermittent hypoxemia and recurrent arousals from sleep. It is 
estimated that approximately 5% of adults in the general population 
meet the diagnostic criteria for SDB.1 A growing body of 
evidence from clinic- and population-based studies indicates that 
SDB is associated with a plethora of adverse health conditions. 
Causal relationships between SDB, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, 
and cardiovascular disease have become areas of intense 
research, and numerous studies now implicate SDB as a contributory 
factor to these conditions independent of conventional risk 
factors such as obesity.2 

Although the mechanisms by which SDB may lead to such 
complications are not completely defined, sympathetic activation 
due to intermittent hypoxemia and/or sleep fragmentation 
has been implicated in the putative causal pathway. There is also 
increasing recognition that low grade systemic inflammation may

degree of SDB and serum levels of CRP, with or without adjustment for 
age and several measures of adiposity. Between the lowest and highest 
quartiles of apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) the mean difference in adjusted 
level of CRP was 3.88 µg/ml (P < 0.001). Moreover, an independent association 
between serum CRP levels and nocturnal hypoxia was also 
observed, whereas no association was noted with parameters of sleep 
architecture. 
Conclusions: While more research is needed to elucidate causal pathways 
involving the effects of sleep-related hypoxia on low-grade systemic 
inflammation, the results of this study suggest that mechanisms other 
than adiposity per se could contribute to the inflammatory state seen in 
adults with SDB.

be yet another mechanism linking SDB to cardiovascular disease. 
Inflammation plays an important role in arterial plaque formation, 
plaque rupture, and vascular thrombosis thereby increasing 
the susceptibility to myocardial ischemia and infarction.3 In 
fact, whether in high-risk or in general populations, serum levels 
of circulating inflammatory markers are predictive of incident 
hypertension4 and cardiovascular events.5,6 C-reactive protein 
(CRP), an acute phase reactant secreted by the liver, is one of 
the most actively studied biomarkers of low-grade inflammation. 
Studies examining the effects of SDB on serum CRP levels have 
provided conflicting results, with some studies demonstrating an 
independent association with disease severity7-16 and others showing 
no relationship.17-22 

Adipose tissue is an important source of inflammatory cytokines23 
and produces a significant proportion of the circulating 
interleukin-6 (IL-6), the principal cytokine that induces CRP.24 
The well established association between obesity, particularly 
central obesity, and systemic inflammation25 raises the possibility 
that the inflammatory marker profile in SDB merely reflects the 
confounding effects of obesity. Furthermore, the high prevalence 
of medical conditions in SDB such hypertension, diabetes mellitus, 
and cardiovascular disease — conditions that are independently 
correlated with higher CRP levels — introduces the added 
concern for confounding in delineating whether SDB is related 
to systemic inflammation. Recognizing the potential limitations 
of previous work, the current investigation sought to determine 
whether SDB and its physiologic consequences of nocturnal hypoxemia 
and sleep disruption were related to CRP levels independent 
of measures of body mass and fat distribution in the absence 
of coexisting medical conditions. We also examined whether 
systemic inflammation in SDB is further influenced acutely by 
the overnight physiologic stress imposed by SDB-related inter

mittent hypoxemia and sleep fragmentation. It was hypothesized 
that SDB severity would be associated with serum CRP levels 
independent of the confounding influences of age and measures 
of body composition and that the overnight physiologic stress imposed 
by SDB would acutely increase CRP levels. 

METHODS 

Study Sample 

Consecutive male patients undergoing clinical polysomnography 
were initially screened for inclusion in the current investigation. 
Women were not included in the study sample because 
the dramatic effects of hormonal differences on CRP26-31 levels 
necessitates recruitment of pre- and post-menopausal women (on 
and off oral contraceptive and hormonal therapy) in subgroups of 
a size that were beyond the scope of the current study. Men with a 
previous history of hypertension, stable or unstable angina, myocardial 
infarction, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, 
coronary artery bypass surgery, congestive heart failure, and 
stroke were considered ineligible. Other exclusionary criteria included 
diabetes mellitus (prior diagnosis or fasting glucose = 126 
mg/dl), chronic obstructive lung disease, renal or hepatic dysfunction, 
and history of upper airway surgery. Finally, patients using 
anti-inflammatory agents (e.g., steroids or other immunosuppressive 
agents), supplemental oxygen, or positive airway pressure 
therapy at any time in the past were also considered ineligible. 
Approval for the study protocol was acquired from the local institutional 
review board, and informed consent was obtained from 
all study participants. 

Body Composition Analysis 

Anthropometric measures included height, weight, and waist 
circumference. Weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg and 
height was measured using a portable stadiometer to the nearest 

0.5 cm. Waist circumference was measured midway between the 
lower rib margin and the iliac crest with the subject in the standing 
position at the end of a normal expiration. Foot-to-foot bioimpedance 
analysis was conducted to estimate percent body fat 
using a Tanita Scale (Tanita Corporation of America, Inc, Arlington 
Heights, IL). Previous studies have found excellent concordance 
of Tanita estimates with measures of body fat derived from 
isotope dilution of tritiated water, underwater weighing, and dual 
energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).32-34 Subjects were measured 
standing erect with bare feet on the analyzer footpads. Percent 
body fat was estimated using the programmed height, weight, age, 
and sex-specific equation.32 
Polysomnography 

The overnight polysomnogram included the following physiologic 
recordings: C3-A2 and C3-O1 electroencephalograms, right 
and left electrooculograms, and submental and bilateral anterior 
tibialis surface electromyograms. Respiration was monitored 
throughout the night with a nasal pressure transducer, thermocouples 
at the nose and mouth, and with thoracic and abdominal 
strain gauges. Continuous recording of the oxyhemoglobin saturation 
(SaO2) was obtained with an oximeter (Ohmeda 3700; Englewood, 
CO). Physiologic signals were digitized (Embla recordings 
systems, Medcare, Buffalo, NY) for offline analysis of sleep and 
breathing patterns. Sleep stage scoring was performed on 30-sec


ond epochs according to standard criteria.35 Apnea was defined as 
complete cessation of airflow for at least 10 seconds. Hypopnea 
was defined as any reduction in airflow that was associated with 
an electroencephalographic arousal or a 4% drop in the SaO2. The 
apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was calculated as the total number 
of apneas and hypopneas per hour of total sleep time. The average 
degree of oxyhemoglobin desaturation (.SaO2) associated with 
each disordered breathing event was determined and used an index 
of hypoxemic stress during sleep. 

Blood Collection and Biochemical Analysis 

A fasting blood sample (10 ml) was obtained from the anterior 
cubital vein in a resting and fasting state shortly after the 
conclusion of the overnight sleep recordings. In addition, a blood 
sample was also obtained just prior to the onset of the sleep study. 
All venous samples were centrifuged immediately and placed at 
4oC prior to serum separation. After centrifugation at 3000 rpm 
for 20 minutes, serum was separated into multiple aliquots and 
stored at -80oC. High sensitivity (hs)-CRP levels were measured 
in duplicate for each eligible patient using commercially available 
ELISA kits (ALPCO, Windham, NH), The hs-CRP assay kit 
has a reported linear range of 1.0 – 150.0 ng/ml and sensitivity of 

0.5 ng/ml. The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation are 
6.33% and 2.20%, respectively. 
Statistical Analysis 

All results are reported as means along with the standard deviation 
(SD) or standard error (SEM). The dependent variable of interest 
was the serum level of CRP. Bivariate associations between 
the morning and evening CRP levels and indices of SDB severity 
were initially examined using scatter plots and Pearson’s correlation 
coefficients. Because the primary objective of the analysis 
was to determine the independent association between CRP level 
and SDB severity, multivariable linear regression methods were 
used to account for the confounding effects of age, BMI, waist 
circumference, and percent body fat. To minimize the influence 
of outlying CRP values, log-transformed CRP levels were also 
modeled. Inferences derived with such transformations were no 
different that those based on modeling serum CRP levels directly. 
Thus, for ease of interpretation, figures display the results from 
the linear modeling of CRP levels. Furthermore, while continuous 
and categorical forms of each independent variable (e.g., 
AHI, .SaO2) were used in the model construction, results from 
the categorical analyses are presented to avoid the assumption 
of a linear association between the dependent and independent 
variables. In addition to modeling the morning CRP levels, the 
difference and the ratio between the morning and evening levels 
were also examined. Statistical significance was determined by 
the two-sided test of each regression coefficient. Model fit was 
assessed by examining the distribution of residuals from each 
multivariable model as a function of the covariates included in 
the model. All statistical analyses were conducted using the Stata 

7.0 statistical software package. 
RESULTS 

The study sample consisted of 69 men with an average age 
of 40.2 years and BMI of 31.2 kg/m2. The anthropometric, body 
composition, and sleep characteristics of the sample are shown

in Table 1. As expected, there was a moderate degree of correlation 
between BMI and AHI (r = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.24–0.62). BMI 
was also correlated with other measures of body composition including 
waist circumference (r = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.87–0.94) and 
percent body fat (r = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.68–0.86). Further bivariate 
analyses revealed that morning and evening CRP serum levels 
were most correlated with AHI (r = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.27–0.64 for 
morning levels, R = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.30–0.66 for evening levels). 
In contrast, the unadjusted associations between CRP and 
measures of body composition were only modest. The correlation 
coefficients between morning CRP levels, BMI, waist circumference, 
and percent body fat were 0.30 (95% CI: 0.07–0.50), 0.34 
(95% CI: 0.11–0.53), and 0.26 (95% CI: 0.02–0.47), respectively. 
No significant differences in morning and evening CRP levels 
were noted (absolute difference = 0.03, 95% CI: -0.13–0.20) in 
unadjusted and adjusted analyses. Thus, all subsequent models 
were based on the morning CRP levels. 

Figure 1 shows the unadjusted and adjusted CRP levels across 
quartiles of AHI. Compared to patients with minimal or no SDB 
(AHI < 6.5, first quartile), CRP levels were higher in patients 
with moderate (AHI: 19.3–50.0, third quartile) and severe SDB 
(AHI>50.0, fourth quartile). Compared to the first AHI quartile, 
the absolute differences in CRP levels for the third and fourth 
AHI quartiles were by 1.94 µg/ml (third vs first quartile, P<0.04) 
and 4.00 µg/ml (fourth vs first quartile, P<0.0001), respectively. 
Adjustments for variables including age, BMI, waist circumference, 
percent body fat, and the amount of total sleep time on the 
overnight sleep study led to some attenuation in the association 
between CRP and AHI. Nevertheless, individuals with severe 
SDB (fourth quartile) maintained a significantly large difference 
in CRP levels (. = 3.88, P<0.002) compared to patients with no 
SDB, and there remained a progressive increase in CRP levels 
with increasing AHI (P< 0.0001 for linear trend). 

Figure 2 shows the unadjusted and adjusted CRP levels as a 
function of the average oxyhemoglobin desaturation (.SaO2) associated 
with occurrence of apneas and hypopneas. With increasing 
degree of oxyhemoglobin desaturation (.SaO2), CRP levels 
increased independent of age and measures of adiposity (i.e., 
BMI, waist circumference, percent body fat). Compared to patients 
that had an average .SaO2 of less than 3.7% (first category), 
patients with .SaO2 greater than 5.7% (third category) had higher 
CRP levels (. = 2.58, P<0.016).

DISCUSSION 


The results of the present study demonstrate that, in the absence 
of confounding medical conditions, SDB is associated with 
elevated levels of CRP independent of age, BMI, waist circumference, 
and percent body fat. In a clinic-based sample of men free of 
medical comorbidity, a dose-response relationship was identified 
between serum CRP levels, the frequency of disordered breathing 
events, and the degree of nocturnal hypoxemia. However, an 
independent association between CRP levels and the distribution 
of sleep stages in SDB was not observed. Finally, comparisons of 
morning and evening CRP levels revealed no significant change 
after a night of directly observed sleep.

The potential impact of SDB on subclinical inflammation has 
been examined in several studies (Table 2). In agreement with 
our findings, SDB has been independently associated with higher 
CRP levels in children10 and adolescents12 – study samples with 
minimal concerns for underlying comorbidities that could confound 
the associations of interest. Although earlier reports7-9 in 
adults also raised the possibility that SDB may independently 
contribute to low-grade systemic inflammation, a number of studies17-
22 have been unable to verify such an association. In fact, in 
the largest clinical sample reported to date, Guilleminault et al.18 
noted that obesity (i.e., BMI) was the primary correlate of serum 
CRP levels and that CRP did not relate to SDB severity. Similarly, 
Can et al.21 recently showed that, while CRP levels were elevated 
in overweight patients with SDB compared to normal weight controls, 
the apnea-hypopnea index was not associated with serum 
CRP levels. The discrepancies across available studies may result, 
in part, from the heterogeneity of study samples, as well as differences 
in the frequency of key determinants of systemic inflammation 
such as body weight, visceral obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular 
disease. It is well established that measures of body 
composition including simple anthropometric indices,36 DXA-
based total fat mass37 and CT-defined visceral fat37,38 are positively 
associated with CRP concentrations. The association between 
obesity and inflammation is ascribed to the fact that adipose tissue 
produces pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-
a (TNF-a)39 and IL-640 that upregulate the hepatic synthesis of 
acute-phase proteins.24 In fact, it is estimated that approximately 
30% of circulating IL-6 is produced by adipose tissue.40 There is 
also evidence to indicate that visceral adipose tissue secretes more 
TNF-a and IL-6 than subcutaneous adipose tissue.41,42 Thus, in 

SLEEP, Vol. 30, No. 1, 2007 

assessing whether SDB can elicit low grade systemic inflammation, 
factors such as body mass, body fat distribution, and medical 
comorbidity must be thoroughly considered. The exclusion of all 
medical comorbidity in the current study and the use of multiple 
obesity measures allowed for a focused examination of serum 
CRP levels in SDB in a sample across the spectrum of SDB severity. 
The present study extends previous work by demonstrating 
that, despite multiple and collinear adjustments for obesity, the 
AHI and the degree of oxyhemoglobin saturation were positively 
associated with serum CRP levels. A unique feature of the analyses 
presented is the identification of an association of serum CRP 
levels with nocturnal hypoxemia but not sleep stage distribution. 
Moreover, although it was anticipated that the physiologic stress 
imposed by intermittent hypoxemia and recurrent arousals due to 
SDB would acutely perturb systemic inflammation, differences 
in morning and bedtime CRP levels were not noted — a finding 
that is consistent with previous work in adolescents.12 The 
lack of overnight change in CRP levels could be attributed to the 
relatively long half-life (~19 hours)43 of CRP, ineffectiveness of 
acute but not chronic bouts of physiologic stress to increase CRP 
levels, or both. 

Assuming that the reported associations reflect a causal effect 
of SDB on systemic inflammation, a relevant question is whether 
the effect is due to SDB-related hypoxemia and/or sleep fragmentation. 
At present, the biological mechanisms underlying a potential 
causal association are not known. Experimental data on the 
physiologic responses to high altitude suggest that a nonspecific 
systemic inflammatory response can be induced by hypoxic exposure, 
usually within 2 days.44-46 Moreover, in vitro studies using 
various cell lines show that low oxygen tension stimulates the 

32

expression and production of IL-6,47-50 the principal initiator of the REFERENCES 


hepatic acute-phase response.24 It is also plausible that disturbance 
in sleep may increase CRP level. Experimental work with acute 
total and short-term partial sleep deprivation shows that sleep loss 
can elevate CRP concentrations.51 However, in the present study 
no such association was observed between serum CRP levels, total 
sleep time and the distribution of sleep stages. 

There are several strengths and limitations of the current study 
that merit discussion. Limitations include the possibility of uncontrolled 
or unknown factors (e.g., subclinical cardiovascular 
disease) that could confound the association between SDB and 
systemic inflammation. However, the exclusion of prevalent medical 
conditions and the adjustments for adiposity with multiple 
covariates limits the degree to which residual confounding could 
potentially bias the results. Another limitation is the fact that only 
indirect measures of obesity (i.e., BMI, waist circumference, and 
measurement of body fat by bioimpedance) were available. It is 
well established that the total body fat and the amount of visceral 
fat are important determinants of circulating CRP levels. Studies 
that incorporate methods which directly measure total body fat 
(DXA scanning) and visceral fat accumulation (MRI or CT) will 
be essential to determine whether the observed associations between 
SDB and CRP persist after accounting for such measures. 
Though more difficult, measures of fatty deposition within the 
liver and skeletal muscle also would define further the effect of 
fat distribution on CRP levels. Another significant limitation is 
that the study sample, which included only men referred for clinical 
polysomnography, necessitates great caution in generalizing 
these findings, particularly to women. Examining the association 
between SDB and CRP levels in women requires consideration 
of factors such as the effects of the menstrual cycle and the use 
of oral contraceptives and hormonal replacement therapy on CRP 
levels. In normal premenopausal women, there is a 2-fold increase 
in CRP levels concurrent with the hormonal changes from the follicular 
to the luteal phase.52-54 As seen in Figure 1, this magnitude 
of change is greater than observed between any adjacent quartile 
of AHI. Moreover, the use of oral contraceptives in premenopausal 
women and hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal 
women has also been shown to influence CRP levels.26-31 Finally, 
because of the cross-sectional design of the current study, no definitive 
statement regarding causality can be made. Unfortunately, 
studies that have examined CRP levels before and after treatment 
with continuous positive pressure therapy have yielded conflicting 
results,9,17,19 thereby limiting inferences regarding cause and 
effect. Studies following CRP levels prospectively in epidemiological 
and clinical samples are needed to further elucidate the 
role of SDB in mediating low-grade systemic inflammation. 

There are several public health and clinical implications if SDB 
is found to be a cause of systemic inflammation. CRP levels that 
are well below the “upper limit of normal” level of 3 mg/dl levels 
may portend an increased risk for future cardiovascular events and 
add prognostic information to traditional cardiovascular risk factors.
55,56 Since more than 25% of the sample in the current study 
exceeded the 3mg/dl cut-point, these data would suggest that a 
state of low-grade inflammation is present in SDB and may act as 
an intermediary in the causal pathway to cardiovascular disease.
